Yah, little Indo on the mic
What's up, what's up?
Little Indo on the mic

It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long time, been a long, long time
Since I've been around town, been around town
Been around town, been around downtown (God damn)
It's all about the vibe (All about the)
It's all about the way I rhyme (All about the what?)
It's all about the prime time
Ah yeah, ah yeah (Tell it to 'em straight, Indo)
It's been a rough time, been a rough time
Been enough time, been enough rough times (So dry)
I don't know about you, but I know about me
And I know I wanna know about you
I zig-zag as I take the throne
Sleazy little Indo gonna take you home
Okay, 'cause I walk like I talk
Aw, shit

Yeah, aha, oh yeah
Aha, oh yeah
Aha (Oh yeah)
Aha (Oh yeah)
Aha, oh yeah
Little Indo on the mic again

I want a good time, want a good time
Want a good time, yeah, I want good time
I just wanna chill, we could just chill
Take a chill pill, then I give it to you real
Talking 'bout the "L" to the "O" to the "V" and "E"
When motherfuckers say they wanna piece of me
I just swag (Swag, swag, swag, swag, swag, swag)
I keep it one hundred, man
Well I don't wanna be another brother
Just your mother's lover
Animated, fated to be sated
Once you made it, baited not to instigate it
But to fade it, cater to the relegated
Underrated, jaded and berated
I'll state it, feel me taste the fever
Free the need to feed the heathen within reason or
They'll catch you clean, redeemed
Unseen, foreseen, inshallah, she will cream
Yah, what's up, what's up?

Yeah, aha, oh yeah
Aha, oh yeah
Aha (Oh yeah)
Aha (Oh yeah)
Aha, oh yeah
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long time, been a long, long time
Since I've been around town, been around town
Been around town, been around downtown
Talking about the "L" to the "O" to the "V" and "E"
When motherfuckers say they want a piece of me
I just swag (Swag, swag, swag, swag, swag, swag)
I keep it one hundred, man

Yeah, aha, oh yeah
Aha, oh yeah
Aha (Oh yeah)
Aha (Oh yeah)
Aha, oh yeah
