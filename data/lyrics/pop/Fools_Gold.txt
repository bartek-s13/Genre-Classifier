Crawled up beside you
And I was yours to hold
Still learning how to
But I was yours to love

I, I, I, I, I
Painted you in gold
When I, I, I, I, I
Held you high above it all

Are we chasing it still?
Will we ever have it like we had it?
Fool's love
When we thought it was real, did we really have it?
Or was it only fool's gold?

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I, I, I, I, I
Painted you in gold
Will I ever find it like we had it?
Fool's gold

Years have passed us
I wonder where you are
Would you forgive me
If I apologise now?

I, I, I, I, I
Painted you in gold
Remind me
How we lost it all

Are we chasing it still?
Will we ever have it, like we had it?
Fool's love
When we thought it was real, did we really have it?
Or was it only fool's gold?

Oh oh oh oh oh
I, I, I, I, I
Painted you in gold
Will I ever find it like we had it?
Fool's gold

Thought we knew love like a love song
Just cause we learned all the words
But you don't realise until the love's gone
Singing it all wrong
Yeah, heartache to heartache, we fight on
Promises blinding the truth
But the truth is it was useless
You and me were just fool's gold

Are we chasing it still?
Will we ever have it like we had it?
Fool's love
When we thought it was real, did we really have it?
Or was it only fool's gold?

Oh oh oh oh oh
I, I, I, I, I
Painted you in gold
Will I ever find it like we had it?
Fool's gold

Fool's gold
Fool's gold
Will I ever have it like we had it?
Fool's gold
