Escape with me, I'll hold you tight
Let the sparks ignite the darkness while our hearts align
Run away with me, leave it all behind
We're estranged from limitation when we free our minds

Do you think we could lose control?
Get lifted when we lose it all

We can be here in this crowd
Feel the music ringing out
With people 'round us singing loud
It's just you and me right now
It's just you and me right now
Do you think we could lose control?


Stay with me, enjoy the ride
We can play here in this perfect take a look inside
Yeah, lay with me, our hearts alive
Find purpose and resurface from that pace we hide

Do you think we could lose control?
Get lifted when we lose it all

We can be here in this crowd
Feel the music ringing out
With people 'round us singing loud
It's just you and me right now
It's just you and me right now
Do you think we could lose control?

Escape with me
Do you think we could lose control?
Escape with me
Do you think we could lose control?

We can be here in this crowd
Feel the music ringing out
With people 'round us singing loud
It's just you and me right now
It's just you and me right now
