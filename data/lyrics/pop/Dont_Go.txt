Slow down
Don’t leave this town
Yes, I’m scared of anything
But I don’t want you to remember me
Well I’m not young and free
I’m trying to build myself back
But I’m waiting for you to call

Far too many times
Have I asked you to carry me
And I promise this time I’m ready
I just needed space and clarity

But I already know
I already care
I can’t be myself and carry on
When you’re not there
I don’t want you to go
Tell me you’ll stay
Tell me this heart that you gave me won’t go away

And I already know
I already care
I can’t be myself and carry on when you’re not there
I don’t want you to go, no
Tell me you’ll stay
Tell me this heart you gave me won’t go away
