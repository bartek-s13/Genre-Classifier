I've been sleeping around all week
And I think you're starting to get to me
I don't, I don't wanna be one of those guys
But it's the only way I get to feel something

I need a distraction, something to happen
Need to stop acting like I'm okay, 'cause I'm not
I wanna feel human, but I just feel stupid, and this shit's confusing
But I'm not okay, no I'm not

If you ask me how I'm doing, I say "fine"
If you ask me how I'm doing, I say "I'm alright"
I'm afraid of being honest 'cause my honesty ain't nice
If you ask me how I'm doing, I say "fine", "fine"

Fine, fine
If you ask me how I'm doing, I say "fine", "fine"

I've been making up bad excuses
To hide from the way that the truth is
It's like I'm not happy with myself
And I'm too ashamed to ask for help
If you ask me how I'm doing, I say "fine"
If you ask me how I'm doing, I say "I'm alright"
I'm afraid of being honest 'cause my honesty ain't nice
If you ask me how I'm doing, I say "fine", "fine"

Fine, fine
If you ask me how I'm doing, I say "fine", "fine"

I need a distraction, something to happen
'Cause I'm not okay, I'm not
I wanna feel human, but I just feel stupid, and this shit's confusing
But I'm not okay, I know I'm not

If you ask me how I'm doing, I say "fine"
If you ask me how I'm doing, I say "I'm alright"
I'm afraid of being honest 'cause my honesty ain't nice
If you ask me how I'm doing, I say "fine", "fine"

If you ask me how I'm doing,  I'm going
If you ask me how I'm doing, I say "fine", "fine"
