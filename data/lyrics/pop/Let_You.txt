You don't understand the chance I took on you
I gave you loyalty, you were on your knees, yeah
Now you're selective with your affection, what did I do?
Expect for love you, always come through
See, for a moment I forgot I had a voice
So I'm telling you what you're 'bout to lose
You don't understand the chance I took on you
Baby, you should know that in my eyes

I think we only got like this 'cause I let you
Only got like this 'cause I let you, let you
Bet you only got with this 'cause I let you
Only got with this 'cause I let you, let you
Let you put your hands on my body, every time
I gave you what you wanted
But when am I gonna get mine?
'Cause we only got like this 'cause I let you
Only got like this 'cause I let you, let you

See I'm not afraid to say it's all my fault
I was passive, you took advantage, yeah
See, you draw your line but I never drew my own
Baby, you should know that in my eyes

I said we only got like this 'cause I let you
Only got like this 'cause I let you, let you
Bet you only got with this 'cause I let you
Only got with this 'cause I let you, let you
Let you put your hands on my body, every time
I gave you what you wanted
But when am I gonna get mine?
'Cause we only got like this 'cause I let you
Only got like this 'cause I let you, let you

Every time that I held back
Made a run for my own back, I
Let you lead me down the wrong track
Yeah, now I've gotta own that, I
Every time that I held back
Made a run for my own back, I
Let you lead me down the wrong track
Yeah, now I've gotta own that, I
('Cause we only got like this
Only got like this) Mm yeah
('Cause we only got like this
Only got like this)
'Cause I let you

Let you put your hands on my body, every time
I gave you what you wanted
So when am I gonna get mine?
'Cause we only got like this 'cause I let you
Only got like this 'cause I let you, let you
