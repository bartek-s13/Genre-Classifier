Eye to eye, we got lips to lips
You're intoxicated, man, I'm faded, ah, ah
My oh my, got me higher
Now there's something changing, it's contagious

Hold your hands on me, hands on you
Energy is up through the roof
You plus me, and me plus you
Can't find that formula with nobody

'Cause we got chemistry
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da, we got chemistry
Da-da-da-da-da (Yeah), da-da-da-da-da (Oh, oh)
Da-da-da-da-da, we got chemistry

Face to face, laying chest to chest
Spending hours talking in the morning, ah, ah
Side by side, got me higher
Laying in this bed, get lost for days here

Hold your hands on me, hands on you (Girl, when I'm holding ya)
Energy is up through the roof (This could get dangerous)
You plus me, and me plus you
Can't find that formula with nobody

'Cause we got chemistry
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da, we got chemistry
Da-da-da-da-da (Yeah), da-da-da-da-da (Oh, oh)
Da-da-da-da-da, we got chemistry

Touching the way that we do
This loving is filling the room
I'm lifted when I'm with you (I'm lifted when I'm with you)
I know you feel what I feel
Been searching for somethin' so real
It's more than a one-night thrill

Oh, oh, oh, my skin, your skin
Eyes are locked in
You know it
We got chemistry (Oh, oh, oh, oh)

Feeling that something
Baby, I'm starving
Give me that loving (Now, now, now, oh)
We got chemistry
The way that our hearts beat
Baby we're talking (You know we got it, baby)
 about it
We got chemistry
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da
