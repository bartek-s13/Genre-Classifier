I have been crazy
But that's just alright, alright
I have been lonely
But that's just alright, alright

My feelings, I don't hide 'em, hide 'em, hide 'em
Inside they keep on burning, burning, burning
Your feelings, you shouldn't hide 'em, hide 'em, hide 'em from me
Na na na na no 'right

Come and get it if you really want it
Come and get it if you really need it
Come and get it if you really want it
Come and get it if you really need it
Come and get it if you really want it
Come and get it if you really need it
Come and get it if you really want it
Come and get it if you really need it

I don’t feel so unfortunate
But that's just alright, alright
I have been treated so badly, baby
But that's just alright, alright

My feelings, I don't hide 'em, hide 'em, hide 'em
Inside they keep on burning, burning, burning
Your feelings, you shouldn't hide 'em, hide 'em, hide 'em from me
Na na na na no 'right

Come and get it if you really want it
Come and get it if you really need it
Come and get it if you really want it
Come and get it if you really need it
Come and get it if you really want it
Come and get it if you really need it
Come and get it if you really want it
Come and get it if you really need it

Every man has been broken
And every woman too
The reason I think I'm something special, baby
Is cause I was never broken by you

Come and get it if you really want it
Come and get it if you really need it
Come and get it if you really want it
Come and get it if you really need it
Come and get it if you really want it
Come and get it if you really need it
Come and get it if you really want it
Come and get it if you really need it
Come and get it if you really want it
Come and get it if you really need it
Come and get it if you really want it
Come and get it if you really need it
Come and get it if you really want it
Come and get it if you really need it
Come and get it if you really want it
