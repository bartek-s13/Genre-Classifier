Racing back to your house
I've been, I've been waiting for this
And loving, loving like there's no one else
And hurting, hurting when you left

But I learned to carry on
And I learned to be okay
'Cause the ones who truly love me will stay

Pouring, pouring out my soul
To someone who never cared at all
And wishing that I had known the truth
And hoping that I could still be with you

But I learned to carry on
And I learned to be okay
'Cause the ones who truly love me will stay

It won't be long now
'Til you come crawling back
You've done it before
And I'm saying no this time
No, no, no, no, no more
'Cause I learned to carry on
And I learned to be okay
'Cause the ones who truly love me will stay
'Cause the ones who truly love me will stay
