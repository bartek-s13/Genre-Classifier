Hook
They lying all the time whilst time just passes by
Yeah they on the side but they ain’t on my side
So much running through my mind
So must running through my mind
They lying all the time whilst time just passes by
Yeah they on the side but they ain’t on my side
So much running through my mind
So must running through my mind
Verse 1
Catch me walking on the long way home
Sometimes I just wanna be alone
Every day I think to run away
Pray for times with a brighter day
Too much on my plate just to let it go
Gotta get my bread for the fam and bros
I be dropping money in a wishing well
No one ever hit me up and wish me well
Yeah it’s just the same old shit just another day
I pray that my shits gonna make a change
Got my hand old the bottle just to fade away
And I be getting high to forget the pain
Over thinking
Over drinking
Iv been sinning
But ask forgiveness

Verse 2
When I wake up I don’t really know what’s next
So I pray up hoping for that cheque
And I be waiting and praying whilst I stress
To my very last breathe imma try my best
But I don’t really wanna do this shit no more
And I don’t really even know myself no more
And I don’t even really think I can help no more
It’s can’t of crazy that I can’t even tell no one
Like how can I love
When I don’t love myself
Like how can I trust
When I can’t trust myself
Over thinking
Over drinking
Iv been sinning
But ask forgiveness
