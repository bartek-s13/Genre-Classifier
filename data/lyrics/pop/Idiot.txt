Please remember me forever
Believe in me as someone
Who's never gonna wish you well

I’m gonna tell you what I think about you
In that unforgivable way I do
You’re an idiot
And I hate your guts
I guess I’m about as happy for you
As I would be a cockroach in my food
I know it’s terrible
I really hate you though

Do you have your fairytale lie?
Are you dancing to the white trash twist?

Oh please, remember me
Believe in me as someone
Who's never gonna wish you well

I heard everything that you hate about me
Almost every day, but you still wouldn’t leave
I had to pull the plug
Ooh, I hated your guts
And I heard the opposite of love isn’t hate
It’s indifference, but I can’t relate
It’s not good enough
'Cause I hate your guts

Did you settle your mediocre mind?
You had the fine wine, you're better off with Bud Light

Oh please, remember me
Believe in me as someone
Who's never gonna wish you well
Oh please, remember me
Believe in me as someone
Who wants you to go to hell

You’re raining, you’re boring
Oh, did you hear me snoring?
I’d wanna mutilate myself when I’d talk to you

So here we have it, I hope you can tell
That I’m no referral, you can have ‘em call hell
You’re gonna drive ‘em nuts
They’re gonna hate your guts
Oh please, remember me
Believe in me as someone
Who's never gonna wish you well
Oh please, remember me
Believe in me as someone
Who wants you to go to hell

Oh please, remember me
Believe in me as someone
Who's never gonna wish you well
Oh please, remember me
Believe in me as someone
