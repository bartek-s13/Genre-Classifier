Go ghost if you like, make sure the door don't hit ya
I was tryna' put donnys on, but I don't think they really got the picture
You can showboat if you like, too bad your girl don't miss ya
Things done changed for a nigga, 'cah before man I used to be the victim
Now I hop out the 4 by 4, man jump out, 1 by 1
Hop out the 4 by 4, man jump out, 1 by 1
Now I hop out the 4 by 4, man jump out, 1 by 1
Hop out the 4 by 4, man jump out, 1 by 1

Way back when, didn't wanna know
Way back when, I was on the ropes
Winter time came, never had a coat
Mummy doin' work, but the money always low
Now I'm on the road, so squaddy we on the road
OT trips for a show, I'm gettin' dough
Bro-bro still on the stove, I need some more
Get my A&amp;R on the phone, let's do a tour
Be about it, be about it, don't talk about it
I got niggas doin' the dirty, I'm still around it
All these women doin' my head in, don't need the baggage
I got my connect,  pick up a package
Laughin' to the bank, 4 by 4 truck
Thinkin' bout the times, I had no buzz
Now I'm 'bout to pop, gyal show love
But I already know, what contour does
Go ghost if you like, make sure the door don't hit ya
I was tryna' put donnys on, but I don't think they really got the picture
You can showboat if you like, too bad your girl don't miss ya
Things done changed for a nigga, 'cah before man I used to be the victim
Now I hop out the 4 by 4, man jump out, 1 by 1
Hop out the 4 by 4, man jump out, 1 by 1
Now I hop out the 4 by 4, man jump out, 1 by 1
Hop out the 4 by 4, man jump out, 1 by 1

This the sound of a boy that was broke, and wasn't known
All alone, got 3-4 friends, but on his own
Never P'd, I played out hard in these streets
I know grief, I buried my brother at 15
These niggas seen, who I was, who I am
Babygirl what's your name, who's your man
Yo that nigga ain't the same, when he's off the gram
If you really know my worth, then let's make plans
Girl play smart, you know I'm the next
Fuck the phony, no love from the set
List of broke niggas, owe me respect
Word on road is, in my city I'm a vet
Made my mum proud, and made my dad pissed
If a nigga did his job, he might've got chicks
Cold, with these niggas, they better get a grip
If they ever get to ask why, I did it for the 5th
Go ghost if you like, make sure the door don't hit ya
I was tryna' put donnys on, but I don't think they really got the picture
You can showboat if you like, too bad your girl don't miss ya
Things done changed for a nigga, 'cah before man I used to be the victim
Now I hop out the 4 by 4, man jump out, 1 by 1
Hop out the 4 by 4, man jump out, 1 by 1
Now I hop out the 4 by 4, man jump out, 1 by 1
