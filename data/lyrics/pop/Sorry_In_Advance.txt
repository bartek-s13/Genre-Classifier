I've been drowning all my problems in alcohol
I've been trying to fix all of these holes
But it's more than an appointment with a counselor
'Cause I don't want anyone else to ever know

I'm sorry in advance for hurting you
Doing all the stupid things I do
I promise I tried, I never wanna lie to you
Can I have another chance?

I'm sorry in advance, I'm sorry in advance
I'm sorry in advance, I'm sorry in advance

You've been calling and forcing things out of me
And you know that I'm grateful for everything
But I can't do all the things you ask of me
'Cause I wasn't built for a love like this
You know I wasn't built for this

I'm sorry in advance for hurting you
Doing all the stupid things I do
I promise I tried, I never wanna lie to you
Can I have another chance?
I'm sorry in advance, I'm sorry in advance
I'm sorry in advance, I'm sorry in advance

I wish I didn't try to push away
I never said I was the one that's sane
I promise I tried, I never wanna lie to you
Can I have another chance?

I'm sorry in advance, I'm sorry in advance
I'm sorry in advance, I'm sorry in advance

I'm sorry in advance
