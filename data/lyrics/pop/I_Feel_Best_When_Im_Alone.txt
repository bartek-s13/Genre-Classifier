Hey there, baby
You wanted to spend some time with me?
Well, I just can't be there right now
You see, a mans gotta do what a mans gotta do
And what a man wants ain't that difficult
But it's actually quite special
See, what a man wants is something I like to call
Alone time
I feel best when I'm alone
Don't take it personal
It's just what I do baby
And if you think that I'm alone
You're slightly wrong
Cause I got my own two cents
Of what it feels to be alone
It's like I'm home
I know it's a strange thing
And if you think there's something wrong
You need to take a stroll
