I know that you're so afraid, I feel it too
You know I can see the pain inside of you
I know I'm not going anywhere
When the silence hits the air, you'll know it too
I know you never asked for this, who ever would
And you carried all the weight alone, you thought you should
Just know I'm not going anywhere
When life's not feeling fair

I wish I could give you an answer
Say the right words and it'd make you feel better
But I'm just me, nothing perfect or special
And I can't make it right today
But I'm here and I'll never fade away

I know back then you played a part for all of them
You know when you're with me you don't have to play pretend
I know you can speak your mind and not get scared
When the silence hits the air, you'll know it too

I wish I could give you an answer
Say the right words and it'd make you feel better
But I'm just me, nothing perfect or special
And I can't make it right today
But I'm here and I'll never fade away

And I hope that you know that I'll always be someone to lean on
And when life gets heavy, I'll carry you through
And I'm hoping that one day it all gets easier
It feels lighter, more beautiful for you
And I hope that you know that I'll always be someone to lean on
And when life gets heavy, I'll carry you through
And I'm hoping that one day it all gets easier
It feels lighter, more beautiful for you
It feels lighter, more beautiful for you

I wish I could give you an answer
Say the right words and it'd make you feel better
But I'm just me, nothing perfect or special
And I can't make it right today
