Sit right here, chill, level low
Close your eyes and just let it flow
Right next to me I hear your heart beat, beat
When the dial turns up and the music starts playing
We don't realize in this society
Doesn't matter how your hair looks, or what they are thinking
Just, just what we are finding, oh

Tap your foot and listen in
Ignore the world, let the music cave in
Close your phone and breathe in the air
You'll soon realize that there's something that is

So much more than this
It is what it is
So much more than this
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Hey)
So much more than this
It is what it is
So much more than this
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

The whole crowd seems to like me now
'Cause I think I'm cool but back when I was in school
They found it very easy to hate me
Funny how always these times are changing
Back then it was so easy to shatter
But now in the end it doesn't really matter

Tap your foot and listen in
Ignore the world, let the music cave in
Close your phone and breathe in the air
You'll soon realize that there's something that is

So much more than this
It is what it is
So much more than this
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Hey)
So much more than this
It is what it is
So much more than this
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

All of the talk and the talk from ya
Won't even matter when the lights come up
All of the talk and the talk from ya, hey
Open your eyes and just wake up
Do all the things that will matter to ya
Open your eyes and just wake up, woah

Tap your foot and listen in
Ignore the world, let the music cave in
Close your phone and breathe in the air
You'll soon realize that there's something that is

So much more than this
It is what it is
So much more than this
(Realize, oh, oh)
You'll soon realize that there's something that is
So much more than this
It is what it is
So much more than this
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

So much more than this
It is what it is
So much more than this
