When you were young
Everyone said "you're just like your father"
Didn't know your own strength
You've taken some blows
So you just hit harder
I was a girl who stood in the playground
Needed a friend to find a way out
I did what you said, I was easily led
But I got my karma

So tell me how come everybody says
"You should live with no regrets"
But everyone has done somethings, I bet they wanna forget

And I was too young to know better
Too young to put it right
I know it ain't big, it ain't clever
So why did I play with fire?
We were out of control, ended up getting burnt
If only I'd known at the time
Too young to know better
And it's been forever
So can we draw a line?
When I was young
Everyone said I'm "just like my mother"
Storm out the room or stay for the show
It's all part of the drama
We both said some things that we didn't mean
Feels like they're carved in stone in me
He knows what buttons to press
I should've left, if I was smarter

So tell me how come everybody says
"You should live with no regrets"
But everyone has done somethings, I bet they wanna forget

And I was too young to know better
Too young to put it right
I know it ain't big, it ain't clever
So why did I play with fire?
We were out of control, ended up getting burnt
If only I'd known at the time
Too young to know better
And it's been forever
So can we draw a line?
I did it all wrong
And I was too young
Can't undo what we done
We were too young

And I was too young to know better
Too young to put it right
I know it ain't big, it ain't clever
So why did I play with fire?
We were out of control, ended up getting burnt
If only I'd known at the time
Too young to know better
And it's been forever
So can we draw a line?
So can we draw a line?
