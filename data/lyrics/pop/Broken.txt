Oh, every night is like a daze
But oh, I'm feeling raise
Yes, I know I'm running late
Let's wait just one more day
I know I'm running
Away from moments
What am I becoming?
I guess something's broken
I guess something's broken
I guess something's broken
What am I becoming?
I guess something's broken
I guess something's broken
Oh, every night is like a daze
But oh, I'm feeling raise
Yes, I know I'm running late
Let's wait just one more day
I know I'm running
Away from romance
What am I becoming?
I guess something's broken
Yeah, I'm feeling stuck
Maybe out of luck
I'm falling in and out of time
Hope that you come home
Please pick up the phone
I need to know if you are fine
I know I'm running
Away from romance
What am I becoming?
I guess something's broken
I guess something's broken
Oh, every night is like a daze
But oh, I'm feeling raise
Yes, I know I'm running late
Let's wait just one more day
I know I'm running
Away from romance
What am I becoming?
I guess something's broken
I guess something's broken
I guess something's broken
I guess something's broken
I guess something's broken
