Thank you, thank you, thank you for coming out today
See, there's so many stupid people, and they always in the way
I hate people, I hate people 'cause people suck, man
People suck, and they keep on fucking sucking

People suck, people suck, people suck (I don't like y'all)
People suck, people suck, people suck (It's not my fault)
They say what goes around comes back around
But sometimes, you get fucked
'Cause people suck, people suck, people suck

I woke up, but my arm's till sleeping
Tried to have a one night stand, she ain't leaving
I'm getting tired of my roommate Keenan
His dishes in the sink and they still need cleaning
He said he'd get it when he gets up, but I won't push my luck
'Cause people suck, people suck, people suck
My neighbors say I'm too loud, I'm gonna fight 'em
If you chewing too loud, I'm gonna fight ya
If you cut me off in traffic, that's a real bad habit
Better hope I don't miss my flight
If you walking too slow, get out the way (Get out the way)
If you smell like BO, it's not okay (Take a shower)
I got another parking ticket, I mean, are you fucking kidding?
Better get that stupid shit out of my face, man

People suck, people suck, people suck (I don't like y'all)
People suck, people suck, people suck (It's not my fault)
They say what goes around comes back around
But sometimes, you get fucked
'Cause people suck, people suck, people suck

I hate politics, I hate logic, I hate physics
I hate climate change, too (If it existed)
And destination weddings are horrible
I hate ugly-ass babies that parents think are adorable (So cute)
I hate you, I probably hate me, too
And there's always more hating to do (True)
Behind your laptop talking like a troll motherfucker
Gonna get what's coming to you
And by the way, what race is the human race?
When is it finished, rebooted, and erased?
Does it cross your mind that maybe this was one big-ass mistake?
So much room in the galaxy, like, we wasting space, man
Nowadays, I got no one to trust
I guess that's why we voted for Trump
'Cause people suck, people suck, people suck (And Hillary sucks, too)

Where the rich people at? (Where they at?)
Where the poor people at? (Where you at? Right here)
Where the shakers, and the fakers, and the killer drug dealers
Politicians, and the terrorists at? (Everywhere)
Where the low credit scores? (Where they at? Right here)
If you a child of divorce  (Where you at? Right here)
Where my users and abusers and alarm clock users?
Better get your ass back to work

People suck, people suck, people suck (Goddamn)
People suck, people suck, people suck (They really fucking do)
They say what goes around comes back around
But sometimes, you get fucked
'Cause people suck, people suck, people suck (Let's go)
People suck, people suck, people suck (I don't like y'all)
People suck, people suck, people suck (It's not my fault)
They say what goes around comes back around
But sometimes, you get fucked
'Cause people suck, people suck, people suck
