Night breaks in two
There's a light in the sky
There's a light and it's all for you
Dawn colours all
Tell me how do you feel
Tell me how do you need to heal
Are you holding your breath again?
Are you holding your breath again?
Breathe, release it all
Come on now
I'll keep you warm
Breathe, release it all
Come on now
I need your love
Come on
I'll steer the wind
Don't you move
Will it carry me easily
Carry me close to you?
Don't lose your sight
When a fire in your heart
Takes a hold of your life
Are you holding your breath again?
Breathe, release it all
Come on now
I'll keep you warm
Come on
Breathe, release it all
Come on now
I need your love
Come on now
Never give up (x6)
Breathe, release it all
Come on now
I'll keep you warm
Come on
Breathe, release it all
Come on now
I need your love
Come on now
There's a light it's all for you
Come on now
There's a light it's all for you
Come on now
There's a light it's all for you
Come on now
Breathe, release it all
