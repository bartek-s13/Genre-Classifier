Cash advances and Jenny's back on campus
I can't believe that it's September
Jenny, what's the story?
All the chicks in her sorority
Asked her how she spent the summer
Said "I interned at some law firm"
Said i got a little sunburned
I saw some raver kid get murdered
And i met this guy, and this guy i met he got me high
And the drum and bass sounds a lot like rollin' thunder
The blue looks beautiful toppin' off the torch
You don't have to go inside to buy, you can buy it off the porch
Twenty-seven lovers in the back half of the summer
I know you think it's way too many
But the x makes me feel sexy and the sex makes me feel empty
The alcohol destroys me
And I did it in a disco with some guy from San Francisco
Who looked a lot like Roger Daltrey
And the night of all that bloodshed I was kissin' on some crackhead
Who said he knew about a party
He keeps it in his mouth in those crazy chipmunk cheeks
I gave him fifty and he kissed me, spit a little treat between my teeth
I think we're starting to peak
Woke up at some hedonistic rodeo
With cowboys kissing cowboys, trading magazines for videos
Yeah God bless the radio, all that fine fine music without all the messed up musicians
And Dwight's a magician, he gets sensible people makin' terrible decisions
Her name was Sally but they all called her Sal Mineo
She was lit up like an arson but she burned out like Arsenio
Her name was Sandy but they all called her San Antonio
She can't remember where she slept last night but she won't forget the Alamo
Sandy, don't forget our alibi
