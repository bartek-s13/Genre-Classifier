<<<<<<< HEAD
Do you remember walking to my house
In December in the morning it was freezing out
I got to hold you it was the best day of that month
But all I wanted was to kiss you on the mouth
But I was shot down
When I needed you the most
I was shot down
I misread your signals, your signals
Do you remember walking to my house
It was Autumn in the night time and you just snuck out
All I wanted was to kiss you on the mouth
All I wanted was to kiss you on the mouth
But I was shot down
When I needed you the most
I was shot down
I misread your signals
I was shot down
When I needed you the most
I was shot down
