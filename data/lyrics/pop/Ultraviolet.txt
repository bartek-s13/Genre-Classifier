You're far away now, I'm over here now
Trying to fill the space
Send your sun up, so I can wake up
In that old familiar place

Tell me what you want, gimme something new
Show me something nobody else can do, but you
I know what you like, I know what you say
I know every step you take, every little move you make
But hey, we do it anyway

White light, here comes the feeling
It's dangerous, it's dangerous
Blue waves, I keep believing
Are strong enough, but then you're
Ultraviolet, can't turn away, can't turn away
Your eyes are fire, can't look away, can't look away

I hit the pavement, I felt amazement
I built some castles made of sand
I tore some walls down and played the underground
Broke some hearts that were made of glass

So tell me what you want, gimme something new
Show me something nobody else can do, but you
You know what I like, you know what I'll say
You know every step I'll take, every little move I'll make
But hey, we do it anyway

White light, here comes the feeling
It's dangerous, it's dangerous
Blue waves, I keep believing
Are strong enough, but then you're
Ultraviolet, can't turn away, can't turn away
Your eyes are fire, can't look away, can't look away

Oh, your light is blinding
Oh, I crave your colors
Oh, and I can't turn away
(It's dangerous, dangerous)
(It's dangerous)

Cause you're ultraviolet, can't turn away, can't turn away
Your eyes are fire, I can't look away, I can't look away
I can't look away, can't look away
You're ultraviolet, can't turn away, can't turn away
Ultraviolet, can't turn away, can't turn away
Ultraviolet, can't turn away, can't turn away

I can't turn away, can't turn away
I can't turn away, can't turn away
