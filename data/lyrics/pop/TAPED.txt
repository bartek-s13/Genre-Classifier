(Taped, taped, taped, taped, taped, taped, taped)

I know I've only existed for 300,000 plus years
So I might not know it all, yeah
But I know my way around the streets in the veins of my brain, oh
(Taped, taped, taped)
Sometimes I feel less human when I lock myself up
Record myself singing "TAPED"
Do you like the way I sound when I'm down and I shut my thoughts up?
Taped, taped, taped, taped, yeah

This one time, I told someone (Yeah)
He said, he said, he said, "I wouldn't wanna have your mind"
I said, I said, I said, "I really, really don’t mind"
I bet that nobody wants to find what I find, ayy
Another time, I met someone
She said, she said, she said, "I wouldn't wanna have your mind"
She left, he left, they left; I really, really don’t mind
I smiled, I smiled, I lied, I agree; I just need some relatability

I tend to overshare every time that someone cares, ah
(Taped, taped, taped) Yeah
The minute I shut up, I shut down and I feel like a clown, oh
(Taped, taped, taped) They're never funny
It's like I'm in a movie where I never got the part
I actually really wanted, yeah
So I live off the success of my head being messy, unimpressed, oh
Taped, taped, taped, taped, taped, taped, ah

This one time, I told someone (Yeah)
He said, he said, he said, "I wouldn't wanna have your mind"
I said, I said, I said, "I really, really don't mind"
I bet that nobody wants to find what I find, ayy
Another time, I met someone
She said, she said, she said, "I wouldn't wanna have your mind"
She left, he left, they left; I really, really don’t mind
I smile, I smile, I lie, I agree; I just need some relatability
'Cause this one time, I told someone
She said, she said, she said "I wouldn't wanna have your mind"
She left, he left, they left; I really, really don’t mind
I smile, I smile, I lie, I agree; I just need some relatability (Yeah)
