I ain't seen you in a while
Damn girl, it's been a long time
I ain't seen you in a while
But you're looking real good, I'm digging your style
I ain't seen you in a while
Damn girl, it's been a long time
I ain't seen you in a while
But you're looking real good, I'm digging your style

Soon as the jet touched down (Touched down)
Knew I had to see what's up (What's up)
Been a while since I been back 'round (Back 'round)
And you're all on my mind, showin' love
So meet me at 1 13th Street
You might not recognize me
Drippin' in these diamonds
And wrapped all in this Gucci

I know we don't speak (We don't speak)
But you're still on my feed (Yeah, yeah)
Every time that you post
And I'm likin' what I see (What I see)
It's been a while (It's been a while) but I'm still like before
Only thing that's been changed
Is my money and my clothes, oh
Boy, let me put you on, show you my glow up
I wanna see your face, you should come pull up
Oh, let me put you on  (Put you on), I want something more (Yeah, yeah)
Maybe this time you're what I'm looking for, mm

Do you remember way back in the 212?
You were all with your boo (Your boo)
Even though I had a man
Deep down, I always knew
That between us there was something
That I could not explain
But I guess I was just too young then
'Cause now I know what it means

I know we don't speak
But you're still on my feed (On my feed)
Every time that you post
And I'm likin' what I see ('Cause you look so good)
It's been a while but I'm still like before
Only thing that's been changed
Is my money and my clothes

Boy, let me put you on (Lemme put you on), show you my glow up
I wanna see your face, you should come pull up
Oh, let me put you on, I want something more (Something more)
And maybe this time you're what I'm looking for (Oh, baby)
Yeah
From LES way to uptown
My Dominicani diamond know the way I get down
See, I'm the big bass, long dreads, big braids
On my way to you, Bedstuy, J train
Riding L-I-TT 'cause she rep Long Island
Shout out Big Diss
My Muslim brother in Harlem
Took me to the fifth spot
Where I begged for your pardon
Then I gave you my number
And I'm glad that you called it

Boy, let me put you on (Lemme put you on), show you my glow up
I wanna see your face, you should come pull up
Oh, let me put you on, I want something more
And maybe this time you're what I'm looking for
