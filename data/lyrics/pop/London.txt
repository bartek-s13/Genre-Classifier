<<<<<<< HEAD
It's been three months since I saw you
Just a few texts here and there
I saw you're on a beach somewhere
I think I forgot to tell you
I found that list on my phone
Of places in London you wanted to go

Those tourist shops around Camden Town
Take a late night ride on the Underground
See the gardens and drink one beer
I know you would die if you knew I was here

I feel so helpless and I feel so far away
If you knew where I was I wonder what you'd say
I feel guilty and I don't know how to tell you
I saw London without you
I saw London without you

Everything here makes me miss you
I can picture us, still in love
Holding hands on a rooftop bus
I haven't posted any pictures
'Cause there's a part of me
That still believes I'll bring you back to
These tourist shops around Camden Town
Take a late night ride on the Underground
See the gardens and drink one beer
I would give the world, but I wish you were here

I feel so helpless and I feel so far away
If you knew where I was I wonder what you'd say
I feel guilty and I don't know how to tell you
I saw London without you
I saw London without you
