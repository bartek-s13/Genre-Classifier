She takes a sip as she leaves reality behind but
Flaming lips as she, she slow dances in the rain
Flawless silence, as I look into her eyes

They’re grey like a sky full of clouds
Oh, grey like a sky full of lies
And grey like my heart when it cries

I don’t even know her name, but I
I’ll call her Julia, I’ll call her Julia
And I know that she don’t feel the same, but I
I’ll leave her never, I’ll stay with pleasure

She smiles as I meet jealousy and guilt
Raging thoughts as she brings me into an imaginary space
Unharmed soul makes my consciousness tilt

It’s dark like a sky full of clouds
Oh, dark like a sky full of lies
And dark like my heart when it cries, when it cries
I don’t even know her name, but I
I’ll call her Julia, I’ll call her Julia
And I know that she don’t feel the same, but I
I’ll leave her never, I’ll stay with pleasure
I’ll call her Julia, I’ll call her Julia
I don’t even know her name, but I
I'll call her Julia, I'll call her Julia
I’ll leave her never, I’ll stay with pleasure

Oh Julia, Oh Julia
Oh Julia, Oh Julia
I’ll call her Julia, I’ll call her Julia
Oh Julia, Oh Julia
I don't know her name
I'll call her Julia
Oh Julia, Oh Julia
Oh Julia, Oh Julia
I’ll call her Julia, I’ll call her Julia

I don’t even know her name, but I
I’ll call her Julia
