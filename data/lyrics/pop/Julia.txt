She takes a sip as she leaves reality behind but
Flaming lips as she, she slow dances in the rain
Flawless silence, as I look into her eyes

They池e grey like a sky full of clouds
Oh, grey like a sky full of lies
And grey like my heart when it cries

I don稚 even know her name, but I
I値l call her Julia, I値l call her Julia
And I know that she don稚 feel the same, but I
I値l leave her never, I値l stay with pleasure

She smiles as I meet jealousy and guilt
Raging thoughts as she brings me into an imaginary space
Unharmed soul makes my consciousness tilt

It痴 dark like a sky full of clouds
Oh, dark like a sky full of lies
And dark like my heart when it cries, when it cries
I don稚 even know her name, but I
I値l call her Julia, I値l call her Julia
And I know that she don稚 feel the same, but I
I値l leave her never, I値l stay with pleasure
I値l call her Julia, I値l call her Julia
I don稚 even know her name, but I
I'll call her Julia, I'll call her Julia
I値l leave her never, I値l stay with pleasure

Oh Julia, Oh Julia
Oh Julia, Oh Julia
I値l call her Julia, I値l call her Julia
Oh Julia, Oh Julia
I don't know her name
I'll call her Julia
Oh Julia, Oh Julia
Oh Julia, Oh Julia
I値l call her Julia, I値l call her Julia

I don稚 even know her name, but I
I値l call her Julia
I値l call her Julia
