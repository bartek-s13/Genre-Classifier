Hold, hold on, hold on to me
'Cause I'm a little unsteady, a little unsteady
Hold, hold on, hold on to me
'Cause I'm a little unsteady, a little unsteady

Mama, come here
Approach, appear
Daddy, I'm alone
'Cause this house don't feel like home

If you love me, don't let go, woah
If you love me, don't let go

Hold, hold on, hold on to me
'Cause I'm a little unsteady, a little unsteady
Hold, hold on, hold on to me
'Cause I'm a little unsteady, a little unsteady

Mother, I know
That you're tired of being alone
Daddy, I know you're trying
To fight when you feel like flying
But if you love me, don't let go, woah
If you love me, don't let go

Hold, hold on, hold on to me
'Cause I'm a little unsteady, a little unsteady
Hold, hold on, hold on to me
'Cause I'm a little unsteady, a little unsteady

Hold, hold on, hold on to me

Hold, hold on, hold on to me
