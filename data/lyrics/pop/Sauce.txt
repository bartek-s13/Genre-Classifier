Memorize what I can’t find in you
Memorize what I can’t find in you
Memorize what I can’t find...
When I’m fresh out of ideas again
And the lost dog out the window finds its home
I let the smog roll over my mind
Walk around tying up my loose ends
I memorize what I can’t say out loud
What will make you uncomfortable
Let’s take off both of our crowns and
Surrender this battle
You make sure I’m level like a pile of laundry
Like the paintings on my wall
Like the scattered light rays
Like the branches in the fall
Like the leaves and the breeze and waterfalls
The birds and the bees and making love
Making love
When I’m fresh out of ideas again
And the lost dog out the window finds its home
I let the smog roll over my mind
Walk around tying up my loose ends
I memorize what I can’t say out loud
What will make you uncomfortable
Let’s take off both of our crowns and
Surrender this battle
Memorize what I can’t find in you
Memorize what I can’t find in you
Memorize what I can’t...
You make sure I’m level like a pile of laundry
Like the paintings on my wall
Like the scattered light rays
Like the branches in the fall
Like the leaves and the breeze and waterfalls
The birds and the bees and making love
Making love
We’re making love we're making
We’re making love we're making
We’re making love
(My favorite drug)
We’re making love
(From up above)
We’re making love we’re making love
We’re making love we’re making
We’re making love
(My favorite drug)
We’re making love
(From up above)
Memorize what I can’t find in you
Memorize what I can’t find in you
Memorize what I can’t...
You make sure I’m level like a pile of laundry
Like the paintings on my wall
Like the scattered light rays
Like the branches in the fall
Like the leaves and the breeze and the waterfalls
Like the birds and the bees and we're making love
