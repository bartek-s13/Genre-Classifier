You and I are young and broken
We both have shit to cope with
One word before we fall apart
You and I, we'll make up reasons
Afraid to show our feelings
Skip out the complicated parts

Oh, where did we go wrong?
I thought I told you from the start that I would rather be alone
Oh, where did we go wrong?
'Cause you told me from the start that you'd be better on your own

But now we're moving in too close
Your hands slip underneath my clothes
My head is telling me no
But my body ain't listening, oh-oh
I think we're going in too deep
But you got everything I need
My head is telling me no
But my body ain't listening

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
My head is telling me no
But my body ain't listening
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
My head is telling me no
But my body ain't listening
Guess it's way too late to turn back
My heart is beating too fast
Naive to think that I could run away
We can make these fake excuses
But baby, who we foolin'?
We're just too scared to mess it up again, yeah

Oh, where did we go wrong?
I thought I told you from the start that I would rather be alone
Oh, where did we go wrong?
'Cause you told me from the start that you'd be better on your own

But now we're moving in too close
Your hands slip underneath my clothes
My head is telling me no
But my body ain't listening

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
My head is telling me no
But my body ain't listening
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
My head is telling me no
But my body ain't listening
A feeling comes over me and I gotta listen
Discover might giving in to my inhibitions
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

But now we're moving in too close
Your hands slip underneath my clothes
And my body ain't listening

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
My head is telling me no
But my body ain't listening
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
My head is telling me no
But my body ain't listening
