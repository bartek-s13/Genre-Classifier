<<<<<<< HEAD
I’m kina waved right now still (haha)
You hear me, ay tell your girl come to the 5ive
I’ll change her life blud, you hear me
Yeah london, Birmingham, Leicester, leeds
Ay even Derby ay gyal everywhere fam
Ay look i’m glist, ayyyy i’m glistening fam

I was with your girl kicking back watching netflix 
Two chains on no necklace
I done put your friends and your friends on the guest list
Don’t you know i’m young and i’m reckless

I don’t think that you’re listening
Got the ting on my wrist and it’s glistening
I don’t think that you’re listening
Got the ting on my wrist and it’s glistening

Girl i ain't your man but you can fling it back
God your batty fat come let me get a grab
Couple parties in the five i’m the fucking mad
Drinks champagne like we got it from the kitchen tap
Her nigga said to us her money gonna drop
But it never, lie shit these niggas peter pan
Girl you know that it goes downing the dm’s
Oh shit is that your man god damn i’d hate to be him BLING BLING
Every time you see me in my city BLING BLING
Missed the shotta rants everything BLING BLING
I pull up and i’m looking like the po BLING BLING
You know how much i spend upon this coat BLING BLING
Let me get a touch girl you know what i’m on
Like it when that booty go bon bon bon
Left side bon, right side bon, everyday i got a mans girl in the farm
I was with your girl kicking back watching netflix 
Two chains on no necklace
I done put your friends and your friends on the guest list
Don’t you know i’m young and i’m reckless

I don’t think that you’re listening
Got the ting on my wrist and it’s glistening
I don’t think that you’re listening
Got the ting on my wrist and it’s glistening

Yo big body i’m the mac daddy in the black cabby with the hotty with that fat batty
Trust nobody when too old daddy but she count money 
Count for me she like ai pappi
On the big stage in the back cali gotta make money 
Getting money don’t make money
In the yard sugar gyal fling pon me tell her 
Take woody take woody don’t break woody
Anything you can do you know i can do better
Sippin on malibu started out with estella
Abracadabra she say my ting getting wetter
Throw on the leather i put my stack in december
I be on the loose 
Got so many bitches that i’m running out of juice
Talking cruddy cruddy tell them drop and give me twos
Chill in with your mrs but you prolly never knew (prolly never knew)
I was with your girl kicking back watching netflix 
Two chains on no necklace

Don’t you know i’m young and i’m reckless
