Do you love me, or just love to take my time up?
If you want me like I want you, make your mind up
I've been waiting, praying you don't keep these games going
All this time I played the fool and I just didn't know it

Every time I take you home
When I wake up, you're gone
Damn

You always play with, play with my emotions
You got me, and you know it
You got me running, running in slow-motion
So why you always playing, playing with my emotions?
Why you play with my emotions?

Are you with me? Won't you give me just a sign tonight?
If you give me more than secrets, I'll be yours for life
I've been waiting, praying you don't keep these games going
All this time I played the fool and I just didn't know it

Every time I take you home
When I wake up, you're gone
Damn

You always play with, play with my emotions
You got me, and you know it
You got me running, running in slow-motion
So why you always playing, playing with my emotions?
Why you play with my emotions?
Why you play with my emotions?
Why you play with my emotions?
Play with my emotions

(Do you love me, or just love to take my time up?)
(If you want me like I want you, make your mind up)
(Are you with me? Won't you give me just a sign tonight?)
If you give me more than secrets, I'll be yours for life

You always play with, play with my emotions
You got me, and you know it
You got me running, running in slow-motion
So why you always playing, playing with my emotions?
Why you play with my emotions?
Why you play with my emotions?
Why you play with my emotions?
Play with my emotions
