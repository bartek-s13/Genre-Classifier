Do you feel safe?
Out in the light
Or is this the place
Where monsters hide?
You're not such an easy target
One minute I know you then I don't
I know you then I don't
You're not such an easy target
One minute I know you then I don't
I know you then I don't
Hello, who are you?
Hello, who are you?
Who are you?
Hello, who are you?
Hello, who are you?
Who are you?
You can't escape
You can't outrun
Your DNA
What's in your blood
You're not such an easy target
One minute I know you then I don't
I know you then I don't
You're not such an easy target
One minute I know you then I don't
I know you then I don't
Hello, who are you?
Hello, who are you?
Who are you?
Hello, who are you?
Hello, who are you?
Who are you?
Who are you?
Who are you?
Who are you?
Who are you?
Who are you?
