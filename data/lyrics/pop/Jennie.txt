Jennie, talk to me, Jennie
You make me go crazy (Why, why)
And all you can say is "No"

Me want no problems
Me ain't tryin' be one of your man dem
All your girlfriend dem, I can't stand dem
I just see them in a jam and pass them
'Cause I just toss dem after I slam dem
'Cause from the jump is you who I want
I give them play, 'cause I was just haunted
Girl, take my number and hit me in the morning

Cell phone ring (brr, brr), get 'em on the line (holla)
Pull up on again (skrrt), come true tonight (come up)
You a bad ting (ting), you know seh you a dime (dime)
Girl come for a ride, up on my roller coaster
