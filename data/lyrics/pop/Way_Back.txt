I was broken
I was acting up
For good reason
Lost all of my love

May still be aching
But I see the sun come up
Days overtaking
And I feel I've overcome

I've found my way back
I've found my way back
Way back, my way back
Way back, my way back
Way back, my way back
Way back, my way back

I've been coping
It's been really rough
And I'm quoting
I have had enough
May still be aching
But I see the sun come up
Days overtaking
And I feel I've overcome

I've found my way back
I've found my way back
Way back, my way back
Way back, my way back
Way back, my way back
Way back, my way back
Way back, my way back
Way back, my way back
Way back, my way back
Way back, my way back
