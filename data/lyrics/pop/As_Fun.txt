If clouds look like sugar, only pretty from afar
And bubbles burst, when we touch them really soft
Maybe we should just watch the view from where we are
But that wouldn't be as fun

If fire is deceiving and it always gets you burned
If taking risk and fighting only leaves you hurt
If hearts get broken when we fall in love to deep
Then maybe we should leave this undone
But that wouldn't be as fun (ah-haa)

Break my heart, I need it
If that's what it takes to feel alive
Waking up, I feel it
Cannot live until I die

If a door finally opens to eventually be shut
And some shoes don't fit, even though you've worked so hard
Maybe we shouldn't never even try at all
But that wouldn't be as fun

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ohohhh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ohohhh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ohohhh
That wouldn't be as fun
