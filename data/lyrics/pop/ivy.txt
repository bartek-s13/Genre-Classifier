Ivy, baby, sweetheart
You’re so insecure, Taking back your words
Oh, lover, loveless
Take me, take me by my hair, take me to your lair

Oh, ivy, sweetheart
Daydream, speechless ain’t your thing;
Tell me what you need
Hey-hey ivy, honey
Daydream, Fill me with your needs
I don’t need to breathe

Oh, I understand, always understand
What’s the problem?
Oh, I understand, always understand
What’s the problem?
Hold-up, I get it
I know that you meant it
The distance between us
The size of a planet
It could have been nothing—
Slow motion discussion
I wake up with nothing
