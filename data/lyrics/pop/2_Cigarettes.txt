Lately I can feel us drifting
Both of us been acting different
We used to be so consistent
Is there nothing left to say, say?

Now I see your face and I just don't know you
Like the picture's there but it's not quite focused
And I know it won't, but I'm still here hoping
That it gets better now
It gets better now, yeah

No more late nights, us just talking
Used to FaceTime, now you just calling
It's no one's fault but some things just fall apart, yeah
I smoke two cigarettes and I don't even smoke, no
Now the sun's coming up and I'm halfway sober
And I know it won't but I'm still here hoping
That it gets better now, whoa

How'd it get so complicated?
Can't even have no conversation
Past the point of trying to save it
But we push it to another day, hey
Now I see your face and I just don't know you
Like the picture's there but it's not quite focused
And I know it won't but I'm still here hoping
That it gets better now, it gets better now

No more late nights, us just talking
Used to FaceTime, now you just calling
It's no one's fault but some things just fall apart (Oh they fall apart), yeah
I smoke two cigarettes and I don't even smoke, no
Now the sun's coming up and I'm halfway sober
And I know it won't but I'm still here hoping
That it gets better now, whoa

(You got me fucked up, damn)
I'm really tryin' to let go
But I can't delete the messages
When you said you'd be my girl forever, shit
Now it's been a week and it's really starting to settle in
We were movin' full speed, now we're just back-pedalin'
All those other couples that were fallin' out of love
We would always talk about how we were so far ahead of them
Energy between us, it was heaven sent
Then it went straight from A+ to the negatives
Outta control, that was after I got off of the road
You hadn't seen me in like, 45 days
I could tell it in your face
Yes, something was up
My arms opened wide
Open, waiting for you to jump
But you just walked up slow
Nah, wait, this ain't the girl I know
C'mon, where she at?
Give her back
Just makin' my jokes, didn't even crack a smile, damn
That's all it took for me to know there was another man
It's all downhill
No more late nights (Late nights), us just talking (Talkin' 'bout baby)
Used to FaceTime, now you just calling (Fallin')
It's no one's fault but some things just fall apart (Oh), yeah
I smoke two cigarettes and I don't even smoke, no
Now the suns coming up and I'm halfway sober
And I know it won't but I'm still here hoping
That it gets better now, whoa
