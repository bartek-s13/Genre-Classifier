Lay down your slow
Come settle down, settle down
Let loose your glow
Come settle down, settle down

And I feel life for the very first time
Love in my arms, and the sun in my eyes
I feel safe in the 5am light
You carry my fears as the heavens set fire

Jump into the heat, spinning on our feet
In a technicolour beat, you and me
Caught up in a dream, in a technicolour beat
Beat, beat, beat

Warm, unalone
Come settle down, settle down
Swing me your bones
Come settle down, settle down

And I feel life for the very first time
Love in my arms, and the sun in my eyes
I feel safe in the 5am light
You carry my fears as the heavens set fire

Jump into the heat, spinning on our feet
In a technicolour beat, you and me
Caught up in a dream, in a technicolour beat, beat

Give me one drop, I can feel you
Make me lose control
We'll be walking, on the water
When we're moving in a technicolour beat
Moving in a technicolour beat

Jump into the heat (falling off the ceiling)
Spinning on our feet (we're moving)
In a technicolour beat, you and me (found another feeling)
Caught up in a dream (we're moving), in a technicolour beat
Jump into the heat, spinning on our feet (we're moving)
In a technicolour beat, you and me
Caught up in a dream (we're moving), in a technicolour beat

Beat, beat
