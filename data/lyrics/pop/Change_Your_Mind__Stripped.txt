Won't you meet me by the water?
Maybe you and I can bitter sweetly
Talk it over by the river side
Oh like, oh like, oh like we use to
All I, all I, all I want is you
Oh lady can I change your mind?
I've been pulling at the hands of time
I wish that I could give you up this time
But oh maybe I can change your mind
I've been talking to my mother, said she's missing you
And I should be calling, back to your girl
That's what I'm trying to do
Oh I, oh I, oh am I getting through?
All I, all I, all I want is you
Oh lady can I change your mind?
I've been pulling at the hands of time
I wish that I could give you up this time
But oh maybe I could change your mind
Oh I, oh I, oh am I getting through?
All I, all I, all I want is you
Oh lady can I change your mind?
I've been pulling at the hands of time
I wish that I could give you up this time
But oh maybe I could change your mind
