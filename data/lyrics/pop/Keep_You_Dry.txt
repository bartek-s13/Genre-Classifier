Lay your bare chest on mine
And feel the beat of our hearts collide
Place your palm over mine
And as the sun rise you will find

When the last leaf drops in wintertime
And the best of your dreams cannot grow
I'll wrap you in my gentle arms and squeeze you tight
When the breeze of the cold kiss the freckles on your nose
I'll keep you dry

Dance with me through the night
Beneath the stars I see shine through your eyes
Lay me bare around the fire
You will always be my heart's desire

When the last leaf drops in wintertime
And the best of your dreams cannot grow
I'll wrap you in my gentle arms and squeeze you tight
When the breeze of the cold kiss the freckles on your nose
I'll keep you dry

I'll keep you dry when the midnight rain arrives
And the thunders all roar a high
Keep you dry when you're feeling hollow in your bones
If the dooms of life knock on your door
And you feel as though you're done for sure
Hold my hands and you will be alright, I will comfort you
And keep you dry

When the last leaf drops in wintertime
And the best of your dreams cannot grow
I'll wrap you in my gentle arms and squeeze you tight
When the breeze of the cold kiss the freckles on your nose
