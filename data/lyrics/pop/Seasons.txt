Season
Right baby sees, ah fi get it nah need no reason
Yes Costi, Yes Mr. Lover
Omi - Shaggy

Girl, you must be sent from above
You keep me warmer than a winter glove
Your smile colorful like flowers in the spring
So me have fi make a toast to your ting, ting, ting
I never meant to fall for your love
I know you're all I'm thinking of
This is more than a summer fling
It's only right that I put on the ring, ring, ring

Said if you left my sight
I won't be okay
Like it's the last time
Love me right through every season
(Through every season - me gal we have fi reason)
There ain't no reason you can't stay
(For every season)

Right through every season
Right through every season
Right through every season

Girl, you bring me up just like the sun on the horizon
And even when it rains I'm enlightened
How you're so sexy and you waist a swing
I'm in love fi watch you when you do your ting, thing, thing
Girl, you make me heart skip a beat
And any time you no near, me no sleep
Feel like the leaves when they drop off the limbs
Me can’t loose you, so me put on the ring, ring, ring

In a world, in a world without, without your love
I don't think I'd be able to breathe
Out of memories when I should be dreaming

Said if you left my sight
I won't be okay
Like it's the last time
Love me right through every season
There ain't no reason you can't stay

Right through every season
I'm loving, I'm loving you like every, yeah
I'm loving, I'm loving you like every, yeah
I'm loving, I'm loving you like every, yeah
Right through every season
Right through every season
Girl you always on my mind
Right through every season
I need you 'till the end of time
Right through every season

You're the apple of my eye
Woman you make me feel like I could fly
There's nothing out there that I could buy
That's better than you and I
Season
Right through every season
Right through every season
Right through every season
Baby girl, you make me sing
