<<<<<<< HEAD
Used to be vulnerable
Used to be dumb
I used to give it all, mmm
Hot like a firestone
One hundred degrees
Oh, but now, I'm so cold
When they kiss me, they touch me, they freeze
They say

Why'd you never trust?
Why'd you never love?
Why'd you never let 'em in?
Why'd you wake up with somebody in your bed again?
And say you love them till you leave
Why you out so late
Dancing with your fake friends
Getting in a state?
When the good guys come, why'd you run away?
Why'd you hurt them?
Well I'll tell you

When you're young and you get your heart broken
And he leaves, leaves the scars open
When you can't believe it's over
That's when you get a little colder
Yeah, when your heart's broken
And he leaves, leaves the scars open
Drunk cry-crying on his shoulder
That's when you get a little colder
They'd have to break me down
Show me real love
Oh, but lately, these boys
All they do is they fuck my head up
They say

Why'd you never trust?
Why'd you never love?
Why'd you never let ‘em in?
Why'd you wake up with somebody in your bed again?
And say you love them till you leave
Don't you wanna stay?
Don't you wanna try?
Putting up a fight
Deep down you know
You know you could make it right
Don't just give in
Oh no

When you're young and you get your heart  broken
And he leaves, leaves the scars open
When you can't believe it's over
That's when you get a little colder
Yeah, when your heart's broken
And he leaves, leaves the scars open
Drunk cry-crying on his shoulder
That's when you get a little colder
Oh-na-na, oh-na-na, oh-na-na
That's when you get a little colder (Oh-na-na)
When you let your guard go (Oh-na-na)
When you let your heart fall (Oh-na-na)
When it starts to hurt oh
That's when you get a little colder

When you're young and you get your heart broken
And he leaves, leaves the scars open
When you can't believe it's over
That's when you get a little colder (That's when you get)

When you're young and you get your heart broken
And he leaves, leaves the scars open
When you can't believe it's over
That's when you get a little colder
Yeah, when your heart's broken
And he leaves, leaves the scars open
Drunk cry-crying on his shoulder
That's when you get a little colder

When you let your guard go (Oh-na-na)
When you let your heart fall (Oh-na-na)
When it starts to hurt, oh (Oh-na-na)
That's when you get a little colder
When you let your guard go
When you let your heart fall
When it starts to hurt, oh
