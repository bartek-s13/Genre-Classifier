I wear my heart upon my sleeves, I understand
I'm hot and cold and then I'm losing who I am
I lost myself along the way, I understand
If you want someone else's hand to take your hand

When I'm out and you're sleeping
And I need you on my phone
'Cause you know that I mean it
When I wish that I was home to hold you
But I have to love you through a call
And I'm thinking you're not missing me at all, no

Baby, the nights that we spent just go hazy
I'm sorry that I asked you to stay
Under the stars in the sand
But baby, these conversations will break me
I'm sorry I wear you like crazy
Giving you all that I am
I'm doing the best that I can

I wear my heart upon my sleeves, I never can
Figure out what you want me to do instead
You said you felt something inside, I understand
If I've been moving you in ways that you won't bend

When I'm out and you're sleeping
And I need you on my phone
'Cause you know that I mean it
When I wish that I was home to hold you
But I have to love you through a call
And I'm thinking you're not missing me at all, no

Baby, the nights that we spent just go hazy
I'm sorry that I asked you to stay
Under the stars in the sand
But baby, these conversations will break me
I'm sorry I wear you like crazy
Giving you all that I am
