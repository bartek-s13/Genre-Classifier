So crucified
And a self inflicted mess
And for the life of me
I couldn't remember
When you weren't a regret

Were you here last night
We fell in love again
Was it just a dream
I've never been that high
As when we fell in love
That was not a dream

Un-crucified
You came to visit
And for the life of me
I, I could remember
That you were not a regret
{Chorus:]
Were you here last night
We fell in love again
Was it just a dream
I've never been that high
As when we fell in love
That was not dream

Don’t want to open my eyes
When we fall in love
