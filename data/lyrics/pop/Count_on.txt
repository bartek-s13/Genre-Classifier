Wait
We found a place
Safe
All on our own

We've come so far
But you have always been my home
I know it's dark
'Cause one of us is letting go

Will you let go? Let go
Will you take home in my heart?
Will you let go? Let go
Will you take home?
If I can count on you
Just let me go, if I can count on you
