You got a hold on me
Everyday you're either hot and cold on me
Didn't know you'd be
All I thought that I would need
Every time I do I see the real you
I don't wanna think about it
Cause' you got a hold on me
Whether I like it or not

You spent up all my time and it got old
I got a little tired of cold shoulders
I know I don't wanna be with you

Now I know
I don't wanna be with you
I don't wanna be with

I lose control of me
Everyday it's like I'm in a hole, you see
You don't let go of me
All the time the same thing
Every time move
I only move to you
I just wanna sit in place
Cause' you got a hold on me
Whether I like it or not

You spent up all my time and it got old
I got a little tired of cold shoulders
I know I don't wanna be with you

Now I know
I don't wanna be with you
Now I know
I don't wanna be with you

Your side of the bed got colder
I got colder too
But I admit I'm bolder
Bolder and better than you
Your side of the bed got colder
I got colder too
But I admit I'm bolder
Bolder and better than you
You spent up all my time and it got old
I got a little tired of cold shoulders
I know I don't wanna be with
I don't wanna be with you

Now I know
I don't wanna be with you
Now I know
