We're rolling "Suicide"

Wake up (Wake up)
Grab a brush and put a little makeup (A little bit)
Hide your scars to fade away the shakeup (Hide the scars to fade away the shakeup)
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table?
Here you go, create another fable
You wanted to, grab a brush and put a little makeup
You wanted to, hide the scars to fade away the shakeup
You wanted to, why'd you leave the keys upon the table?
You wanted to

I don't think you trust
In my self-righteous suicide
I cry when angels deserve to die

Father! (Father!) Father! (Father!)
Father! (Father!) Father! (Father!)
Father, into your hands I commend my spirit
Father, into your hands
Why have you forsaken me?
In your eyes, forsaken me?
In your thoughts, forsaken me?
In your heart, forsaken me? Oh

Trust in my self-righteous suicide
I cry when angels deserve to die
In my self-righteous suicide
