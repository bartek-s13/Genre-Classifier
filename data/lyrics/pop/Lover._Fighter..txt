(Oh, a, hey-o)(x4)

Everybody says there's two kinds of hearts when
One loves and one goes to warn
Some make peace and others get even
No solid ground to stand for

Surely, it's not easy or too simplified ohh
I'm dying while you walk away and I
Wanna put my boots on and march to the front line

I will be your lover, Fighter
Harder, Higher
Lover, Fighter
I wanna fight for lover, Fighter
Under, Fire
Lover, Fighter
I wanna fight for love, Love, Love
Wanna fight for love, love, love

Then when you pulled it, burn like a bullet
It was love, it was heating, was true
We were called in the battle, and all of it shattered
But I'm aiming higher not to lose you

I know, it's not easy or too simplified ohh
But you and I are on each other's side so
Take my hand and we'll march to the front lines

I will be your lover, Fighter
Harder, Higher
Lover, Fighter
I wanna fight for lover, Fighter
Under, Fire
Lover, Fighter
I wanna fight for love. Love. Love
Wanna fight for love, love, love

I know, it's not easy or so simplified, ohh
But you and I are on each others side
Ooo
I know, it's not easy or so simplified, ohh
But don't you know that I lay down my life
Ooo

I will be your lover, Fighter
Harder, Higher
Lover, Fighter
I wanna fight for lover, Fighter
Under, Fire
Lover, Fighter
I wanna fight for love. Love. Love. (x2)
I wanna fight for love! Fight for Love! Fight for love!
(I wanna fight for lover. Fight for Lover. Fight for Lover) (x2)
