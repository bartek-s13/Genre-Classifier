I've been waiting for you
Tell me that it's over
I've been waiting for you
Looking over my shoulder
And I won't waste another night losing sleep
Looking for your headlights, show up back in the drive
I've been waiting for you
Trying to stay sober

Are you getting closer?
I just need some closure
I've been waiting too long for you to come over
Are you getting closer?
I just wanna hold you
Leaving the door open if you wanna close it

Are you getting closer?
Tell me that it's over
Are you getting closer?
Tell me that it's over

Found a book in my room with your pictures and your letters
Little pieces of you are keeping me together
And I tried going out at night to forget
Get lost in the headlights, stumble home every time
Wondering if you're still mine
Not just someone to remember
Are you getting closer?
I just need some closure
I've been waiting too long for you to come over
Are you getting closer?
I just wanna hold you
Leaving the door open if you wanna close it

Are you getting closer?
Tell me that it's over
Are you getting closer?
Tell me that it's over

Are you getting closer?
I just need some closure
I've been waiting too long for you to come over
Are you getting closer?
I just wanna hold you
Leaving the door open if you wanna close it
