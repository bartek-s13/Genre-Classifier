Where's your rosey, rush?
Now babe, I think I've lost my touch
Why won't you open up your reins?
Amour, I hope for trust
Astray, I search upon the storm
She told me all my worth is worn
Woah, where I lay I'll wake for you
Woah, stuck and stray, I'll wait for you
Oh no, woah I'm blind, girl I may
Love, if you hold my hand with grace
I miss your golden grin, now love is lost in search for him
I wish for cold these flames would smolder, peace runs awfully thin
Under my skin, woah
I seek to live, woah
Woah, where I lay I'll wake for you
Woah, stuck and stray, I'll wait for you
Oh no, woah I'm blind, girl I may
Love, if you hold my hand with grace
Love
Love
Love, woah
Oh, love
Love, woah
Oh, love
(Gus, we need to talk. I'm just not happy anymore. I'm sorry)
