Down by the river
I was drawn by your grace
Into depths of oblivion
And to the lovers place
I was stucked in a puddle
Full of tears and unwise
Dark doings now I know
That we've paid unlike

Honey, I know hey
When we walked arm in arm
I felt like we can throw away
The falseness of our past
And I know too
It's been the hardest days for you
Let's throw them out the window
That's what those lovers do
