You never loved me like you said you did
You only showed me what a liar is
But all I needed was the opposite

Oh, oh, I
Oh, I gave ya all of my expectations
But no, you could never meet them

Took my head and fucked it up
You made this heart of stone
What you gave was not enough
Oh, and you go on and on and on
And I've heard it all before
Just being honest
It don't hurt like it used to
Took my heart and fucked it up
For that, I won't forgive
Hurtin' me, you called it love
Oh, and you go on and on and on
And I've heard it all before
Just being honest
It don't hurt like it used to

I always try to keep it positive
So why'd you have to throw your weight on me?
But now I'm stronger 'cause I've lifted it

Oh, oh, I
Oh, I gave ya all of my expectations
But no, you could never meet them
It don't hurt like it used to

Took my head and fucked it up
You made this heart of stone
What you gave was not enough
Oh, and you go on and on and on
And I've heard it all before
Just being honest
It don't hurt like it used to
Took my heart and fucked it up
For that, I won't forgive
Hurtin' me, you called it love
Oh, and you go on and on and on
And I've heard it all before
Just being honest
It don't hurt like it used to

It don't hurt me
It don't hurt me
It don't hurt me
Like you did before
Were you worth it?
You weren't worth it at all

Took my head and fucked it up
You made this heart of stone
What you gave was not enough
Oh, and you go on and on and on
And I've heard it all before
Just being honest
It don't hurt like it used to
Took my heart and fucked it up
For that, I won't forgive
Hurtin' me, you called it love
Oh, and you go on and on and on
And I've heard it all before
Just being honest
It don't hurt like it used to

(Took my head and fucked it up) It don't hurt like it used to
It don't hurt like it used to
(What you gave was not enough) It don't hurt like it used to
It don't hurt like it used to
Oh and you go on and on and on
And I've heard it all before, just being honest
It don't hurt like it used to
