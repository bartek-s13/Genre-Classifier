Yeah

You don't gotta tell me 'bout your body count
I don't gotta know your ex's name
'Cause if it just so happens that you turn around and ask me
I think you might feel some type of way
I dodge dick on the daily, yeah
I know it's funny, but it's true
And I bought this Mercedes all by myself
Got the papers to prove

We don't need no one, yo', tryna take our freedom, yo'
Time won't let you stay young
So, we don't care what they say
We gon' love who we wanna love

Love, yo', love, yo', love
We gon' love who we wanna love
Love, yo', love, yo'
We don't care what they say
We gon' love who we wanna love
You don't gotta tell me 'bout your body count (no, no, no)
Baby, I ain't gonna post you on my page (haha)
'Cause odds are that goodbyes are cumming soon
So, maybe you should put a rubber on your heart before it breaks
'Cause all your friends want my baby (yup)
I know it's funny, but it's true (yeah)
But some nights I would rather make love to myself
Singing to my own damn tune

We don't need no one tryna take our freedom
Time won't let you stay young
So, we don't care what they say
We gon' love who we wanna love

Love, yo', love, yo', love
We gon' love who we wanna love
Love, yo', love, yo'
We don't care what they say
We gon' love who we wanna love

I saw my ex and then I swerved, sue me
Miss me with that bullshit for the birds, sue me
I know they did me dirty while I still had the title
But I don't hold any anger, I just swerve
Hallelujah
Yeah, yeah
Hallelujah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
That's what I said to them (yeah)
