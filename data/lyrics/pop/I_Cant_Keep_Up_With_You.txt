I can't keep up with you
Don't know where to go if you want me to
Cause every word that you say
Keeps leading me on but so far away

I don't know why I'm running in circles
Trying to find a miracle
Biding my time till you're home
When I can't keep up with you
But I could move on if you want me to

And I'm singing how could I have waited so long
And I'm singing maybe that's what makes me strong
And I'm singing, and I'm singing, I've been singing on my own Maybe that's what made me strong

Cause I can't keep up with you
But I don't think I ever wanted to
And at the end of the day
I know that deep down we both feel the same

I don't know why I've been running in circles
Trying to find a miracle
Biding my time till you're home
When I can't keep up with you
So we can move on if you wanted to
And I'm singing how could I have waited so long
And I'm singing maybe that's what makes me strong
And I'm singing, and I'm singing, I've been singing on my own
Maybe that's what made me strong
Cause I can't keep up with you
So we can move on if you wanted to
