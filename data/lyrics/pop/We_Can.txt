Whoo! Alright!
Oh yeah!

Look out down below, Sonic is on the go
Can't stop this party 'til we save the world
This time, not alone; we've got some friends along
And as a team, we can become even stronger

Together, we can overcome all the odds
It's never as hard as it seems
If everyone can do something special
The secret is sharing our dreams
(Yeah!)

We can make it if we all stick together
We won't give up, not ever
And everything's going to be alright
We all bring out the best things in each other
Together, we are stronger than anyone else could be on their own

So much better than alone!


Sonic's in the lead, giving us greater speed
Tails keeps us flying high to stay above trouble
And Knuckles by our side, makes this a safer ride
We'll save the world and teach that Eggman a lesson!

Together, we can overcome all the odds
It's never as hard as it seems
If everyone can do something special
The secret is sharing our dreams (Oh ho!)
(Yeah!)

We can make it if we all stick together
We won't split up, not ever
It's easier with my friends by my side
We all bring out the best things in each other
Together, we are stronger than anyone else could be on their own

So much better than alone!
Better than alone!


And together, we can overcome all the odds
It's never as hard as it seems (Yeah, yeah!)

We can make it if we all stick together
We won't give up, not ever
And everything's going to be alright
We all bring out the best things in each other
Together, we are stronger than anyone else could be on their own

Can't stop us 'cause together, we are strong!
