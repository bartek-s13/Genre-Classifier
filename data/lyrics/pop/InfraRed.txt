(From the darkness I see the light in you)

Don't stress, don't stress
No one knows what goes on in our heads, our heads
We are invisible to the rest, the rest
They don't know nothing 'bout what we have, we have

'Cause everyone's living in black and white
But we see each other in a different light

Infra-red
I Know that you’re burning up for me
Fire in your bloodstream
Moving through you at light-speed
I see you, I see you in Infra-red
The heat and the light and the way you move
Like nobody else is in the room
I see you, I see you

It's okay, okay
They won't understand us anyway, no
You and I are on a different wave
So, doesn't even matter what they say

'Cause everyone's living in black and white
But we see each other in a different light

Infra-red
I know that you're burning out for me
Fire in your bloodstream
Moving through you at light-speed
I see you, I see you in Infra-red
The heat and the light and the way you move
Like nobody else is in the room
I see you, I see you

Everyone's living in black and white
We see each other in a different light
That's why I look at you like I do
Like nobody else is even in the room
We see each other in a different light

Infra-red
I know that you're burning out for me
Fire in your bloodstream
Moving through you at light-speed
I see you, I see you in Infra-red
The heat and the light and the way you move
Like nobody else is in the room
If you fall into me, I fall into you
I see you, I see you
