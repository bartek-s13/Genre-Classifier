Running through the black night
I'm sure I have the green light
A car ran over, I thought that I would die
Then from the X-ray, back to the rat race
I wanna win this and now that I'm alive
All these streets look different
Like I'm born again

There in the dark, down in the valley
Under the motel neon sign
Room 105 at the back of the alley
You're wearing my coat while sleeping
And it feels like I've come home

It's hard for the dreamers when the cities never sleeping
But we're gonna make it, although we don't know how
I pay a high price for the joy of a free ride
'Cause I got you and now that's all that counts

There in the dark, down in the valley
Under the motel neon sign
Room 105 at the back of the alley
You're wearing my coat while sleeping
And it feels like I've come home, ooh ooh
Yeah, it feels like I've come home, ooh ooh
This I know, right from the start
Like it's the first time, it finally feels like coming home

There in the dark, down in the valley
Under the motel neon sign
Room 105 at the back of the alley
You're wearing my coat while sleeping
And it feels like I've come home, ooh ooh
Yeah, it feels like I've come home, ooh ooh
This I know, right from the start
Like it's the first time, it finally feels like
Yeah, it feels like I've come home
