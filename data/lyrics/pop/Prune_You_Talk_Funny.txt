I like the way that words come out your mouth
It takes me many miles to make them out
And strawberry sits superbly with you
Go on and lick me love I'm jelly in my shoes

And I would tread upon flowerbeds to
Stare and stop
A hominid t'was blossoming from
Soot and sod (ah, ah ah, ah)
Prune
Eating all my food

Well you're like the bum
Who begged and pegged me up all wrong
I've got no two cents, no sense at all
Well you're like the bum
Who begged and pegged me up all wrong
I've got no two cents, no sense at all

I like the way you decorate your neck
It takes me just a sec to break a sweat
And russet rims portray that of a goon
Go on and test me love like sipping from a spoon

And I would tread upon flowerbeds to
Stare and stop
A hominid t'was blossoming from
Soot and sod
Oh, prune
Eating all my food

Well you're like the bum
Who begged and pegged me up all wrong
I've got no two cents, no sense at all
Well you're like the bum
Who begged and pegged me up all wrong
I've got no two cents, no sense at all
Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha, ha ha ha
Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha, ha ha ha
Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha, ha ha ha
