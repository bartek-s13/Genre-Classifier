Hang up your coat, take the weight off your shoulders
You still don't know just what you are
Take off your hat, lay your head next to mine babe
Come rest with me and forget the world awhile

There's a lot of people in America, in America (Ah-ah)
Three hundred million in America, it's a miracle (Ah-ah)
(Ah-ah) That my road crossed yours
And that your road crossed mine
'Cause there's a lot of people in America

Sometimes it's cruel when the Devil fools you
Just keep your cool when the day wears you down
Come rest with me and forget the world awhile

'Cause there's a lot of people in America, in America (Ah-ah)
Over three hundred million in America, it's a miracle (Ah-ah)
(Ah-ah) That my road crossed yours
And that your road crossed mine
'Cause there's a lot of people in America

And I thought no one could see me
And I was walking for a thousand miles
Out of every state and city
You were the one I was waiting to find
There's a lot of people in America, in America (Ah-ah)
Over three hundred million in America, it's a miracle (Ah-ah)
(Ah-ah) That my hand felt yours
And that your heart felt mine
'Cause there's a lot of people in America (Ah-ah)
Yeah, there's a lot of people in America (Ah-ah)
Yeah, there's a lot of people, it's a miracle
