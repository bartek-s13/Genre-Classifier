After all you’ve done I still came back to you
Look at what I did to follow through
On the plans that you thought were impossible
I’ll show you what I’m worth
It’s about time we open up
About what’s been swept under the rug
For as long as I could remember
You’ve never cared for
What I want
Or what I’ve done
I always thought I was heading for the light
Thought I would be dancing with the stars
The road is quite a bit longer
But I won’t quit ‘cause I’ve come so far
You can step on me but I’ll grow back
On the sidewalk inbetween the cracks
Like a wildflower grows to the sunlight
No you can’t cut me down
I’ll grow stronger
Take my time
I’ll flourish down the line
You just wait
I’ll show you
I always thought I was heading for the light
Thought I would be dancing with the stars
The road is quite a bit longer
But I won’t quit ‘cause I’ve come so far
Hold on tight for a while
The storm will pass
It will be alright in the end
Rain will only feed the grass
There will be a silver lining
The clouds will pass
It will be alright in the end
I won’t forget
I always thought I was heading for the light
Thought I would be dancing with the stars
The road is quite a bit longer
But I won’t quit ‘cause I’ve come so far
But I won’t quit ‘cause I’ve come so far
No I won’t quit ‘cause I’ve come so far
