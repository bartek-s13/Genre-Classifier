For you
Baby, I would die for you
I'ma work my whole life for you
No other by my side but you

Tryna roll, always see your face in the morning
You can wear my shirt when it’s cold if you wanna
Still got me feeling like the very first summer
That I saw ya, and now I don't wanna live without you

Baby, call me up when you're alone
I just wanna hear you talk
You’ve been on my mind for way too long
Up all night thinking ‘bout you
I'll give you all my love ‘cause you're all I want
I wanna give you all of me
And when I saw those eyes, I knew you were the one
When I saw those eyes, baby, I could barely breathe

For you
