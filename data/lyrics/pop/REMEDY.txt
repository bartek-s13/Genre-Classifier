Na na na na
Na na na

Music to my ear, you my melody
Late nights, feeling sick, you my remedy
I remember every moment, every memory
Sippin' on you, fuck sippin' on the Hennessy
Have you livin' in the hills out in Beverly
Yeah, we coulda been forever, been a legacy
But you tryna fight, claimin' that we enemies
Thinking 'bout the jealousy, forgettin' all the chemistry, yeah

Whatever happened to "Together 'til we seventy"?
We moved apart, girl, now we livin' separately
I remember you, can't you remember me?
Loving you, my speciality, you my secret recipe
You helped me find myself, a part of my identity
My love, my oxygen, to me you a necessity
I hope this reaches you, if not, it's my serenity
Bars on my mind like I'm convicted for a felony
And ahh, that was a hard time
It's been a while since we talked, it's been a long time
I've been on my phone, checkin' if you online
Stalkin' up your page, wonder if you're on mine
Been a couple years, thought that I'd be over you
Still hold the tears when I think of holding you
You left and disappeared, I can't get a hold of you
I can't believe you'd do me wrong, was someone else controlling you?
'Cause after all the times, everything we been through
Every time you lie, I'd always defend you
And when I saw you cry, I'd just hold you gentle
For you I prayed to god, to me you like a temple
So tell me, did you love me or did you pretend to?
Everytime you touched me, was it even special?
Was I a priority or squeezed into the schedule?
Baby, you an angel, same time you the devil
After all the times, everything we been through
Every time you lie, I'd always defend you
And every time you'd cry, I'd just hold you gentle
For you I prayed to god, to me you like a temple

Music to my ear, you my melody
Late nights, feeling sick, you my remedy
I remember every moment, every memory
Sippin' on you, fuck sippin' on the Hennessy
Have you livin' in the hills out in Beverly
Yeah, we coulda been forever, been a legacy
But you tryna fight, claimin' that we enemies
Thinking 'bout the jealousy, forgettin' all the chemistry, yeah
Music to my ear, you my melody
Late nights, feeling sick, you my remedy
I remember every moment, every memory
Sippin' on you, fuck sippin' on the Hennessy
Have you livin' in the hills out in Beverly
Yeah, we coulda been forever, been a legacy
But you tryna fight, claimin' that we enemies
Thinking 'bout the jealousy, forgettin' all the chemistry, yeah, yeah

Duh duh, na na na na na na, yeah, yeah
Duh na na na na na na na, yeah, yeah
Duh na na, duh duh duh duh duh, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
