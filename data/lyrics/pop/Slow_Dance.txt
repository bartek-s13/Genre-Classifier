If you stay for this minute
Girl, I'll never let you down
We ain't off the limit
I could hold you after now

No more talking, I don't know what you wanna do with that
It feels good, why you even wanna hold it back?
We just work and I know there's no coming back
Where you at? Where you at? Where you at?

I wanna slow dance if you're feeling me now
If we don't hold hands, you'll be killing me now
I need a romance, one chance
I just wanna know, will you slow dance?
I wanna slow dance if you're feeling me now
If we don't hold hands, you'll be killing me now
I need a romance, one chance
I just wanna know, will you slow dance?

And do you mind if I say it?
Just wanna have you around (Oh)
We take, then we give it
Something lifts us off the ground, baby

No more talk, I don't know what you wanna do with that
It feels good, why you even wanna hold it back? (Hold it back)
We just work, so I know that there's no going back
Where you at? Where you at? Where you at?

I wanna slow dance if you're feeling me now (If you're feeling me now)
If we don't hold hands, you'll be killing me now
I need a romance (Romance), one chance (One chance)
I just wanna know, will you slow dance?
I wanna slow dance if you're feeling me now (If you're feeling me now)
If we don't hold hands, you'll be killing me now (Killing me now)
I need a romance, one chance (One chance)
I just wanna know, will you slow dance?

It won't work, it won't work, it won't work out
If we don't have a say in this world now
Taking turns, taking turns in this dance now (Yeah)
I won't forget about you

I wanna slow dance if you're feeling me now
If we don't hold hands, you'll be killing me now (Killing me now, no, no, no, no)
I need a romance, one chance
I just wanna know, will you slow dance?
I wanna slow dance if you're feeling me now
If we don't hold hands, you'll be killing me now (Killing me now)
I need a romance, one chance (One chance)
I just wanna know, will you slow dance?
