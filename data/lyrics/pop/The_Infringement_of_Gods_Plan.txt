Torn flat pages
Encased in a dark binded blanket
Blood stained hand prints
Inscription of the bleeding eyes
That decay as they write
The scratched sonnets
Of scripted crucifixion
And self mutilation
Crimson words blurred
From the tears that fall as the hopeless ramblings are indicted
Into the bland white pages
Into the dull darkness
As the light slips away
Torn flat pages
Encased in a dark binded blanket
The scratched sonnets
Of scripted crucification
I reign my realm with the coldest of intention
I show no mercy
No mercy to those who beg
