I hear 'em coming from miles around
Closing like footsteps without a sound
I may be a fool but this is the truth
It’s coming for me, and trust me, it's coming for you

I, I wanted peace in my mind, in my mind
I say now, you, you make it harder to find, to find

I see shadows moving around
I never let 'em closer, I just stick to the sound
I see shadows closing in
I never let ’em get me, I just keep moving

Look at me running, don't know where to
I got my reasons and so do you
Keep on believing, you'll start anew
Mmh, it's coming for me, and trust me, it's coming for you

I, I wanted peace in my mind, in my mind
I say now, you, you make it harder to find, to find

I see shadows moving around
I never let 'em closer, I just stick to the sound
I see shadows closing in
I never let 'em get me, I just keep moving

Move with me (Woo)
(Move, aha, move, aha, move, aha)
Shadows, yeah, yeah
Move with me (Hey)
(Move, aha, move, aha, move, aha)

It's coming for me, it’s coming for me
It’s coming for me, it's coming for me (Move with me)
It’s coming for me (Oh, move with me), it's coming for me (Move with me)
It's coming for me (Yeah)

I see shadows moving around
I never let 'em closer, I just stick to the sound
I see shadows closing in
I never let ’em get me, I just keep moving

Move with me (Woo)
(Move, aha, move, aha, move, aha)
Move with me (Hey)
