Light hits your eyes
My favourite eyes
It's my favourite part of the night
'Cause you don't change
And I'm the same
Same old hopeless case and well
You should know you still turn me on
With freckled covered shoulders
I used to wake upon on
I would shed my blood to unfuck this up
To move out of the shadows
But I just stay put

You see I'm a bit unstable
Twenty drinks a night to
Hide that I can't stand not having you
I come across as heartless
Even though my heart breaks
Every time you're close
Don't you think that ooooh
It's so obvious that I want you
I go crash into the same old scenic views
And just as I'm about to say the truth
I lose you to somebody else
Hey, it's such a waste
A pointless game
Shots and fire
Damage and pain
I should steer clear
But I can't leave
If you don't leave with me I'll be
In this booth getting drunk and broke
Pretending I don't notice you through the faded smoke
I can't keep from watching your fingers move
Like ripples on the inside of her clothes
This night's so long

You see I'm a bit unstable
Twenty drinks a night to
Hide that I can't stand not having you
I come across as heartless
Even though my heart breaks
Every time you're close
Don't you think that ooooh
It's so obvious that I want you
Well fuck it I got nothing left to lose
But just as I'm about to say the truth
I lose you to somebody else again
I lose you to somebody else again
