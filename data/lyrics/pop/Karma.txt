I should have known from the start
You play reckless with my heart
And now you wanna say goodbye
So I'm gonna let you go
You still gonna pay for though

For every night you left me here on my own
For every reason I believed in, every lie that you told
For every fight you left me out in the cold
For every reason
Hey yeah, hey yeah

You better run, run, run, yeah
It's coming your way, ooh-ooh-ah, ooh-ooh-ah

Now you're breaking hearts in the dark, dark
You play your games with your cards, cards
You will taste your poison in the end
You should've let me go
'Cause now I'ma let you know

For every night you left me here on my own
For every reason I believed in, every lie that you told
