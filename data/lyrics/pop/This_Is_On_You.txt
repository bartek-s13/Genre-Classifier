<<<<<<< HEAD
So you're calling me drunk
And you’re outside a club
And you're lonely in SoHo
And you hate everyone
And you wish I was there
It's no fun going solo
Now you wanna be friends
Always sad on weekends
And I was your pick-me-up
And I would say, "Pick me up"
But not anymore

Who gave it all, and held you up
When nobody else gave a fuck?
Who bailed you out?
That was all me
Who was your biggest fan and oldest friend?
Your steady hand you traded in
But still stuck around
Well that was all me

But this is on you
It’s your bed, babe, it's your funeral
This is on you
Did my best, babe, and you threw it all
Did all I could do
And you need me now but I'm clocking out
So this is on you (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
This is on you (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
And I get that you're hurt
Having issues at work
Always fight with your father
But for years I was there
Had your back, it's not fair
How you took me for granted
I went down with the ship
Always your therapist
Always your good luck charm
Hanging on to your arm
But not anymore

Who gave it all, and held you up
When nobody else gave a fuck?
Who bailed you out?
That was all me
Who was your biggest fan, and oldest friend?
Your steady hand you traded in
But still stuck around
Well, that was all me

But this is on you
It's your bed, babe, it's your funeral
This is on you
Did my best, babe, and you threw it all
Did all I could do
And you need me now but I'm clocking out
So this is on you (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
This is on you (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Who gave it all, and held you up
When nobody else gave a fuck?
Who bailed you out?
That was all me, yeah
Who was your biggest fan and oldest friend?
Your steady hand you traded in
Still stuck around
That was all me

But this is on you
It’s your bed, babe, it’s your funeral
This is on you
Did my best, babe, and you threw it all
Did all I could do
You need me now but I'm clocking out
So this is on you (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
This is on you
But this is on you
It’s your bed, babe, it's your funeral
This is on you
Did my best, babe, and you threw it all (You threw it all)
Did all I could do
You need me now but I'm clocking out
So this is on you (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
