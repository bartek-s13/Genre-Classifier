It's gonna be okay
I know the walls are closing in
But please don’t run away
I know you gotta let it sink in
But please don't overthink it
I know you gotta let it sink in
But please don't overthink it

I don’t blame you, so don't blame yourself
You call yourself crazy and that doesn't help
I know you feel hurt, but don't play the victim
You know your worth, don't need validation ('Cause)

You gon' be the illest out here walkin'
Must be doin’ something right ’cause now they talkin'
Be the realest out here, be, be the realest out here
You gon’ be the illest out here walkin'
Must be doin' something right 'cause now they talkin’
Be the realest out here, be, be the realest out here

It's gonna be too late
By the time they figure out
You'll be doing your own thing (Doing your own thing)
While they judge the way you're walking down the hallways
Standing in the doorway
Too afraid to dream but tell you yours are too far off
Just kill 'em with silence, they don't wanna riot
With all this good good, no way to deny it
I don't blame you, so don't blame yourself
You call yourself crazy and that doesn't help
I know you feel hurt, but don't play the victim
You know your worth, don't need validation ('Cause)

You gon' be the illest out here walkin'
Must be doin' something right 'cause now they talkin'
Be the realest out here, be, be the realest out here
You gon' be the illest out here walkin'
Must be doin' something right 'cause now they talkin'
Be the realest out here, be, be the realest out here

They'll know better than to count you out
They'll know better than to serve you doubt
They'll know better, they'll know better ('Cause)

You gon' be the illest out here walkin'
Must be doin' something right 'cause now they talkin'
(Now they talkin', oh)
Be the realest out here, be, be the realest out here
(Be the realest out here)
You gon' be the illest out here walkin'
Must be doin' something right 'cause now they talkin'
(Somethin' right, yeah)
Be the realest out here, be, be the realest out here
