Wherever you are

We walked up to the tower
They looked down from above
I never dreamed trouble could be coming from
So few people

Wherever you are
Let's get loud like thunder
Know in your heart
They won't drag us under
They can blow, every brick we lay will make us stronger

All we heard was a whisper
When they paid for a beating drum
They never dreamed together we could make a sound
That would drive them out

 (x3)
Wherever you are
Let's get loud like thunder
Know in your heart
They won't drag us under
They can blow, every brick we lay will make us stronger

Thunder
