If I told the truth
You wouldn’t believe me
You wouldn’t believe me at all
Always thought
That he never loved me
That he didn’t love me at all

I was wrong
I was wrong
He loved me all along
I was wrong

If he told the truth
Then I would never believe him
I wouldn’t believe him at all
He said he thought
That I didn’t love him
That I didn’t love him anymore

But he was wrong
He was wrong
I love him
Now he’s gone
He was wrong
He was wrong
I love him
Now he’s gone
