I'm a little shy, but I know you know
I haven't done this too much, cause I did not know

I'm feeling this devotion, touching your emotion
I can see the love run right out of you
Moments like these are golden, never felt so open
Even if I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming with you

So breathe my air, and kiss me there
Cause I'm a little cold but I'll warm up with you
Heart out my chest when you put it there
Yeah I’m a little cold but I've warmed up with you
Ooo, ooo, I...
Ooo, ooo, I...
Ooo, ooo, I...
Ooo, ooo, I...

I don't care too much for valentines
I just need your skin next to mine

I'm feeling this devotion, touching your emotion
I can see the love run right out of you
Moments like these are golden, never felt so open
Even if I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming with you

So breathe my air, and kiss me there
Cause I'm a little cold but I'll warm up with you
Heart out my chest when you put it there
Yeah I’m a little cold but I've warmed up with you
Woo, ooh, I...
Ooo, ooo, I...
Ooo, ooo, I...
Ooo, ooo, I...
