You ain't no typical kind of girl
And you are what I've been waiting for
So take, take me to a place I know, I know
You don't even know how beautiful you are
Never seen someone so natural
And I don't know how I (can explain it)
You don't even know how beautiful you are
Never seen someone so natural
And I don't know how I can explain it
Cause you know that you just knock me off my feet
And I know I can't deny it, and I know that I can't deny it (can't deny it)
Yeah you knock me off my feet
And I know I can't deny it, and I know that I can't deny it can't deny it
Hypnotizing, it's like I'm out of body tonight
I'm flying, you got me on a high
So take, take me to a place I know, I know
