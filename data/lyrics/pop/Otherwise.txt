If I'm honest, I'm scared as hell
And I don't think that I'm doing well
If you ask I'll be doing just fine
But I wouldn't tell you otherwise

Cause a distraction, stare at my feet
Rehearse a reaction so nobody sees
The cracks in the wall, starting to fall
Run in a circle, doubling down
Stay on the surface and don't turn around
I don't wanna face it
Don't think I can take it
Afraid I might break

Open eyes

If I'm honest, I'm scared as hell
And I don't think that I'm doing well
If you ask I'll be doing just fine
But I wouldn't tell you otherwise
I don't feel like I measure up
'Cause I don't feel like I'm good enough
If you ask I'll be doing just fine
But I wouldn't tell you otherwise

I put on a smile, I put on a show
But it's only denial
What scares me the most
Is that I believe it
I never see it
And it keeps on repeating

Open eyes

If I'm honest, I'm scared as hell
And I don't think that I'm doing well
If you ask I'll be doing just fine
But I wouldn't tell you otherwise
I don't feel like I measure up
'Cause I don't feel like I'm good enough
If you ask I'll be doing just fine
But I wouldn't tell you otherwise
I wouldn't tell you otherwise

I don't see it
I don't see it
I don't see it

Open eyes

If I'm honest, I'm scared as hell
And I don't think that I'm doing well
But I tell myself I'm doing just fine
And I wouldn't know it otherwise
