We them niggas at the park, we just wanna ball
Sellin dope, we get a car and don't know what its called
Nniggas foul, but the referees dont get involved
Its the finals, and my dogs came to take it all
With the her-ion , nigga im Lebron (HUH)
Quarter millie for my car, and thats on the Quran
You running with me nigga, or you better run two
Ties for you pussies cause you know who number one
These bitches all on my dick, is it all of my cars
They say my Audemar sick, just bought a ?
This a ten million flip, so nigga fuck what you talk
100 million off the rip, the definition of boss
She can tell how I'm ballin, dat I'm just gettin started
Yea I took an advance, put 20 keys in the projects
Had to scoop my lieutenant, had to make my deposits
Niggas DIEE everyday the time choppa comes out the closet
And I pride myself, I'm gettin money in the street
I ride myself, I'm the one you gotta see
I bring it straight to your door, do you like it Manolo
When you flashin that money, them people flashin your photo
Kno I'm fuckin these broads, cause I'm flashy as fuck
Five live-in maids, my crib nasty as fuck

A nigga play, I want his head im talkin 80 thou
I tell my shooters go get em, they go make a cow
Ridin in a wiz a fortune, then I made a vow
I will never let these rapper niggas take a stow
My dogs karate chop them bricks, then they take a bow
Throw a banana in the air ak then I make a smile
Blake Griffin on these niggas, rookie of the year
This ordinary shittin on these niggas
And I heard that they be hating, I ain't trippin on these niggas
Make it rain all these hoes, havin it drippin on these niggas

Got birds flyin around, like mr 23 himself
You want to eat, I got the food
Nigga come and see the chef
We ain't playing by the rules, put the toolie on the reps
Scored a foul line nigga, payin high by the high now
When I get the Gucci, only 3note is the dial now
Skunk screamin loud, tryna speak a whole sound now
My heart so hard, the cookie need a powerdrive
I'm triple a arrogant ass attitude
100 down south, right down the last avenue
This the dead end, gotta kill to fit in
So pop your act and move it, if he can bring the shit in
Lebon 5.0s white tee, hood rich
I got cheerleaders too, and everyone a hood bitch
And a whip the color the yayo, n that mutha fucka foreign
Whi-whi-whip the color yayo, n that mutha fucka foreign
