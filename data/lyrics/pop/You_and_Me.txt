Life could get better
You know it's a letter that I wrote to myself
When I was little had the thought but it was brittle
We were young, maybe I was dumb
Little did I know that you could be dah be dah one
Lighter than a feather
Had me floating over all kinds of stormy weather
Didn’t have a reason or rhyme
You made it better
Then you came over, we were not sober
No more cold shoulder got me like
Never thought you'd have me sayin
Oooo
Weee
Now ya got me thinkin
Youuu
Meeee
Wetter than a shower
Open like a flower
Turned it all the way up but you still wanted it louder
Then you turn it over, but it's never over
Record on repeat baby I just flip you over
When I drop the needle
On the things that we do, we could take it slow girl we don’t need to speed through
Wanna explore you, break the headboard to
Shake all of the walls in the house I'm coming for you like
Never thought you'd have me sayin
Oooo
Weee
Now ya got me thinkin
Youuu
Meeee
I thought you said what I didn't know
I thought about the timing and the things that just didn't go
Maybe I was wrong maybe I right
Didn't matter but we ended up together in the night time
Maybe you knew it was good to begin with I thought that y'could take a hint bitch
Crazy I didn't but then you thought it was better from the beginning it’s another night got me like
Never thought you’d have me sayin
Oooo
Weee
Now ya got me thinkin
Youuu
Meeee
