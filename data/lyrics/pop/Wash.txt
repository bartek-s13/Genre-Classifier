Cycles
First it's warm and then it's too cold
Getting sick from all this motion
Washed away all my devotion
Well

I never want to
Become just like you
It's pretty simple
Wish I could tell you why
I try my hardest
I would be honest
If i could think straight
If i could speak my mind

Swimming
'Til the water started spinning
Now I feel it down in my throat
Heart's too heavy for a lifeboat
Well
I never want to
Become just like you
It's pretty simple
Wish I could tell you why
I try my hardest
I would be honest
If i could think straight
If i could speak my mind
