Do you remember when we used to be
Them happy kids, them happy kids?
When we were better, but in our memories
We are happy kids, them happy kids

Oh, take me back to the days
We were dancing in the streets going insane
We had no money, had no name
But I knew that you and I would never change

Do you remember when we used to be
Them happy kids, them happy kids?
When we were better, but in our memories
We are happy kids, them happy kids

Do you remember?
We are happy kids, them happy kids
Do you remember?
We are happy kids, them happy kids

Oh, take me back into the streets
Where I met the cutest girl I've ever seen
We fell in love at seventeen
And got my heart broken when she had to leave
Do you remember when we used to be
Them happy kids, them happy kids?
When we were better, but in our memories
We are happy kids, them happy kids

Do you remember?
We are happy kids, them happy kids
Do you remember?
We are happy kids, them happy kids

We are happy kids, them happy kids
