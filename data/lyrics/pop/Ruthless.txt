Hello, it's nice to see you again
Did you miss me?
We're meant to be friends
But it feels like a century
In my head

If I say something that comes out all wrong
Please forgive me
For feeling this strong
Like it feels just like angels
Hmmm in my head

But darling the truth is
In darkness I'm ruthless
I wanna scream your name
Again and again

Maybe I
Am tempted by all that I see
You're nothing like me
I'm circling the room
In gold and French perfume

But darling the truth is
In darkness I'm ruthless
I wanna scream your name
Again and again

Oh baby, I'm misunderstood
And you’re the only one who knows I could
See it all in black and white
Looking better by my side
Oh baby I don't want to be
The only one that's talking in my sleep
I could be your lullaby
Be my lover every night

Can we fly away?
Can we fly away?

Cause darling the truth is
In darkness I'm ruthless
I wanna scream your name
Again and again

Oh baby I don't want to be
The only one that's talking in my sleep
I could be your lullaby
