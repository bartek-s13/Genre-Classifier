I'm looking for my sweet home Alabama
Not far from the sea
Where the clouds don't seem to matter
There's color in the trees
I love the rain in Indiana
But it's time for me to leave
All the hills in California
Sitting right in front of me

So where do I go? 'Cause I'm on my own
So where do I go? 'Cause I'm all alone
I don't need to think, 'cause I'm living young
I don't need to think, 'cause I'm having fun, yeah

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh-oh
Oh oh oh ohh
Oh oh oh oh

They think I've gone crazy
You're out of your mind
I'm patiently waiting
It's coming with time
And I don't think I'm ever giving up
This sunset on my side is just enough

So where do I go? 'Cause I'm on my own
So where do I go? 'Cause I'm all alone
I don't need a thing, 'cause I'm living young
I don't need a thing, 'cause I'm having fun, yeah

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh-oh
Oh oh oh ohh
Oh oh oh oh

And how am I supposed to know
The hell I'm doing
I'm giving all I can to ya
I just hope it's worth it
'Cause right now I'm just fine
Running around wasting time
On my own, oh

Sweet home, sweet home, sweet home
Sweet home, sweet home
Sweet home, sweet home, sweet home, sweet home
Sweet home, sweet home
