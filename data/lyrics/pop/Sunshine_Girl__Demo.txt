Baby, what you hiding from?
Maybe you should taste the sun
Baby don’t you wanna come
With me?

Maybe, baby, it’s you
Ooh, it’s you
Baby I care for you
Ooh, I do

Baby, don’t you wanna see?
Baby, don't just leave me be
After all, it’s you and me
You’re the one

Maybe, baby, it’s you
Ooh, it’s you
Baby I care for you
Ooh, I do

(You’re all I really need)
