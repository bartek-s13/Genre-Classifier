Do you remember when we were so good?
Or do you forget like I do, forget like I do?
But you were my first and you've taken a piece of me
I painted you in the blame and it’s not okay

I was selfish
Couldn't help it
But I still care about you, still care about you now
I know I'm stubborn
But I still think about you

Cause maybe it was me
I just couldn’t see
But maybe it was me who fucked it up
Or maybe it was us
So helpless and young
Or maybe everything was all my fault
And I regret
All the times
Of leaving you, in the back of my mind
Cause maybe it was me
And I just couldn't see
But maybe it was me
Magnified all of your flaws in my head
We know that I've got mine too, I've got mine too
Wonder if you have forgiven me yet
Cause I am still trying to, I am still trying to

I was selfish
Couldn't help it
But I still care about you, still care about you now
I know I'm stubborn
But I still think about you

Cause maybe it was me
I just couldn't see
But maybe it was me who fucked it up
Or maybe it was us
So helpless and young
Or maybe everything was all my fault
And I regret
All the times
Of leaving you in the back of my mind
Cause maybe it was me
And I just couldn't see
But maybe it was me
Oh, oh
Oh, I finally realised (oh)
I’ve opened my eyes
And now I see (oh)

Cause maybe it was me
I just couldn’t see
But maybe it was me who fucked it up
Or maybe it was us
So helpless and young
Or maybe everything was all my fault
And I regret
All the times
Of leaving you in the back of my mind
Cause maybe it was me
And I just couldn't see
But maybe it was me
