If I say it loud, would it make it real?
And if you go now, would I feel anything?
When you're out on the weekends
Catching up with your old friends
Do they ask you 'bout how we've been?
When you're walking home, do you think of me?

And how I fell in deep when you touched my skin
How easily my hands left you shivering
Didn't catch our breath before we jumped right in
Now I don't know if we can make it out
Breaking everything with a single touch
I don't even know how to make us stop
This might be the part where you lose me

And I'm about to, I'm about to
I'm about to lose you too, ooh
Yeah, I'm about to lose you too, ooh

If you let me go, will you let me know?
And if we leave it here, are we letting go
Of drive-aways on the weekends?
Hundred nights with no sleep and
Hundred miles with no seat belts on
When I feel alone, do you think of me?

And how I fell in deep when you touched my skin
How easily my hands left you shivering
How we went from "How are you?" to "How you been?"
Now I don't know if we can make it out
Breaking everything with a single touch
I don't even know how to make us stop
This might be the part where you lose me

But I'm about to, I'm about to
I'm about to lose you too, ooh
I'm about to lose you too, I know, ooh
I'm about to lose you too, ooh
I'm about to lose you too, ooh
If you let me go, will you let me know?
'Cause I'm about to lose you too, ooh

How I fell in deep when you touched my skin
How easily my hands left you shivering
How we went from 'how are you?' to 'how you been?'
