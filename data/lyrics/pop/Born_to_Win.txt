So hear we are
The future's now
The time, your time, has come
The stage is set
The lines are drawn
Today you'll shine, my son

Earth is shaking
Don't be scared

You were born to walk
So that you could run
You were born to fall
So that you could stand up strong
Sometimes you gotta bleed
So you can feel your skin
You were born to win

Your not alone
We've been here before
On giant shoulders, tall you stand
All is that you need
All is that you have
When you fit right in my hand
The world is waiting
All is bear

You were born to walk
So that you could run
You were born to break
So that you could come back strong
The only way to start
Is for you to begin
You were born to win
You were born to win
You were born to win
You were born to win

Here we lay
Here we stand
In my love it will never end
Take your bones in you hand
Come the day you'll understand
Here we lay
Here we stand
In my love it it will never end

You were born to fly
You were made with wings
You were born to cry
So that you could learn to breath
Always be the man
And the child within
You were born to win
You were born to win
You were born to win
You were born to win
You were born to win
You were born to win
You were born to win
You were born to win
You were born to win
You were born to win
