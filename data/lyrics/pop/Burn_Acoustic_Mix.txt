Yeah
You look familiar, skin like vanilla
You're onto me, I'm onto you
I gotta make it work
In my blood like tequila
And it's making me weaker
I look, you look
Our bodies talk, no need to say a word

Your dancing like nobody else, nobody's watching
And if you let me
I won't take it, I won't take it

Slow-ow-ow, all the way-ay-ay
We can go-o-o
You're a fire, you're a fire
I wanna burn
Burn, burn, burn it up-up-up
Let you know-ow-ow
You're a fire, you're a fire
I wanna burn
You're a fire
I wanna burn
Now we got familiar
We melt like we're chocolate
I taste your love, you're like a drug
Yeah I'm gonna give you all
All my attention, to all your dimensions
Let's do the things we're made to do
And let our bodies talk

Let's do it like nobody else, nobody's watching
And if you let me
I won't take it, I won't take it

Slow-ow-ow, all the way-ay-ay
We can go-o-o
You're a fire, you're a fire
I wanna burn
Burn, burn, burn it up-up-up
Let you know-ow-ow
You're a fire, you're a fire
I wanna burn
You're a fire
I wanna burn
You're a fire
I wanna burn
