Just have a little patience
I'm still hurting from a love I lost
I'm feeling your frustration
But any minute all the pain will stop

Just hold me close inside your arms tonight
Don't be too hard on my emotions

Cause I
Need time
My heart is numb, has no feeling
So while I'm still healing
Just try and have a little patience

I really wanna start over again
I know you wanna be my salvation
The one that I can always depend

I'll try to be strong
Believe me, I'm trying to move on
It's complicated but understand me

Cause I
Need time
My heart is numb, has no feeling
So while I'm still healing
Just try and have a little patience
Have a little patience

Cause the scars run so deep
It's been hard but I have to believe
Have a little patience
Have a little patience

Cause I
I just need time
My heart is numb, has no feeling
So while I'm still healing
Just try and have a little patience
Have a little patience
My heart is numb, has no feeling
So while I’m still healing
