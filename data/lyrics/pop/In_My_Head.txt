Let me say this first
I'm forever yours
But you love the trouble
We've been here before

Even though it hurts
You're my favorite curse
I can't fight the thrill
But through all the struggle
I will be here still

So when you tell me you can't take no more
Say goodbye and slam the door
I will never feel alone, feel alone

So if we fall apart
Yeah, I still got you in my head
You in my head
If we lost to time
Yeah, I'd still find you in my head
You in my head
I cannot live with you
Cannot live without you
You're in my head
You're my greatest pleasure
And my perfect high
Yeah, you make me better
But only for a while

So when you tell me you can't take no more
Say goodbye and slam the door
I will never feel alone, feel alone

So if we fall apart
Yeah, I still got you in my head
You in my head
If we lost to time
Yeah, I'd still find you in my head
You in my head
I cannot live with you
Cannot live without you
You're in my head
You're in my head

So if we fall apart
Yeah, I still got you in my head
You in my head
If we lost to time
Yeah, I'd still find (you in my head)
You in my head (you in my head)
I cannot live with you
Cannot live without you
You're in my head
I cannot live with you
Cannot live without you
You're in my head
