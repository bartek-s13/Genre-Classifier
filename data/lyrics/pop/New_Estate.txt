She’s been out for a week or a little more
Again and again and again counting all these hours at night
A single cloud was passing by
Hiding the moon behind the white
She always said
Years been fast in a row, but i didn’t count
From time to time it felt like we have chosen different roads
Oh the future is gonna be a new estate for you and me
At least, at least in your eyes
(Oh, I sway)

Down to the upper side, I can see ghosts how
Long until the morning glows
Read it in your eyes
I believe in my own lies

Oh

She’s been out for a second change
In a land where milk and honey flows
Through our veins
What does an old picture tell?
I thought I’ve always stayed the same
At least in your eyes

Down to the upper side, I can see ghosts how
Long until the morning glows
Read it in your eyes
I believe in my own lies
Down to the upper side, I can see ghosts how
Long until the morning glows
Read it in your eyes
I believe in my own lies

Huh

Love can't hold us
Same way as it can’t leave us alone
It’s easy, one more step and my head is gone
Serena, all I need and all I want you to
Believe me all I need and all I want you to
(Oh, I sway)

Down to the upper side, I can see ghosts how
Long until the morning glows
Read it in your eyes
I believe in my own lies
Down to the upper side, I can see ghosts how
Long until the morning glows
Read it in your eyes
I believe in my own lies

Oh, oh
Can’t read it in your eyes
In the dead of the night
I can't read it in your eyes
I believe in my own lies
