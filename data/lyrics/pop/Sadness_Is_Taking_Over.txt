When we were frozen, you, you took the cold away
When we were primal love, you took the old away
And I now we go to bed and then you turn away
Do you remember all we sacrificed, the pain?

Sadness is taking over
Your eyes, your eyes
Your mouth, your mouth
Sadness is taking over
Your life, your life
Your mind, your mind

And it's like nothing ever happened
Don't you tell me
And it’s like nothing ever happened
Don't you play with me

Minutes, hours, seconds, eons go
I don't, I don't, we don't need to know
We don't have it, every answer still
Could it be that we don't own the will?

Sadness is taking over
Your eyes, your eyes
Your mouth, your mouth
Sadness is taking over
Your life, your life
Your mind, your mind

And it's like nothing ever happened
Don't you tell me
And it’s like nothing ever happened
Don't you play with me

See life in the right light
It's a bright ride, ain't it baby?
One time we were so high
See the bright side, won't you baby?

Sadness is taking over
Your eyes, your eyes
Your mouth, your mouth
Sadness is taking over
Your life, your life
Your mind, your mind
Sadness is taking over
Your eyes, your eyes
Your mouth, your mouth
Sadness is taking over
Your life, your life
Your mind, your mind

And it's like nothing ever happened
Don't you tell me
