Tiny bubbles
Are always leading me knee-deep into some sort of trouble
These yayo hoes take off their clothes
And try to get me to give them something chemical
And are you dancing like you're staggering drunk?
Or are you drinking like you're trying to dance?
Hey, soap suds
You know you're way too quick to fall in love
She's got the fingerless gloves
She's got the nails done up in the nasal drugs
Shorty still making some love
Some bingy basketballer on some bearskin rug, right
And she came on like she wanted a kiss
Now she's kissing like she already came
She came on like she wanted a kiss
Now she's kissing like she already came
(And all the trash got gacked)
They sit and stare and stare and sit and sniff and sing along with the soundtrack
You know where you are
You're in the jungle, baby
You're gonna die
(Push it real good)
(And then the foam rolled in)
I must admit I was a little bit aroused by it
(And then the foam rolled in)
I must admit it felt a little bit erogenous
(And then the foam rolled in)
I must admit it felt a little bit anonymous
(And then the foam rolled in)
I must admit I feel a little bit anonymous now
The fists, the foam and the fingerless gloves
They felt so right
They felt so right
The microphone and the synthetic drugs
It sounds so nice
It sounds so nice
Your cokey kisses in the tunnel of love
Taste like black ice
They taste like black ice
The microphone and the synthetic drugs
It sounds so nice
It sounds so right
