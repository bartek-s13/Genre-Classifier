Think you're so important to me
Think you're so important to me, don't you?

You shut me down, you like the control
You speak to me like I'm a child
Try to hold it down, I know the answer
I can't shake it off and you feel threatened by me

I tried to play it nice, but oh
Oh, ooh-ooh, don't kill my vibe
Oh, ooh-ooh, don't break my stride (Oh)
You think you're so important to me, don't you?
But I wanted you to know that you don't belong here
You think you're so important to me, don't you?
Don't kill my vibe
(Don't you)

You love to tear me down, you pick me apart
Then build me up like I depend on you
But I throw myself from heights that used to scare me
Guess you're surprised, I'm the puzzle you can't figure out
I tried to play it nice, but oh
Oh, ooh-ooh, don't kill my vibe
Oh, ooh-ooh, don't break my stride
(I tried to play it nice, but oh)
You think you're so important to me, don't you?
But I wanted you to know that you don't belong here
You think you're so important to me, don't you?
Don't kill my vibe

Say I'm young, I don't care, I won't quit, no, no, no, ho
Say I'm young, I don't care, I won't quit, no, no, no, ho
And oh, whoa
You're acting like you hurt me, but I'm not even listenin'
Hey, no
You're acting like you hurt me, but I'm not even listenin'
Don't kill, don't kill my vibe
You think you're so important to me, don't you?
But I wanted you to know that you don't belong here
Think you're so important to me, don't you? (Don't you?)

I tried to play it nice, but oh
Oh, ooh-ooh, don't kill my vibe (Don't you)
Oh, ooh-ooh, don't break my stride (Don't you)
(I tried to play it nice, but oh)
You think you're so important to me, don't you?
But I wanted you to know that you don't belong here
You think you're so important to me, don't you?
Don't kill my vibe
