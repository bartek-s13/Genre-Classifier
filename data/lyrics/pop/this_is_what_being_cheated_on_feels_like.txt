Falling on the sheets in the morning
Wondering where she's been all evening
When she told me that she’d leave me for Ethan
In my mind i had the guts to believe that
Everything would be right as you said
I had no reason to pickup on all the loose ends
Always thought the best of you believing
But now this little boy woke up to false beliefs and

It's been two hours from the time we set our clocks to meet up
If you had only gave me time I swear I could of told ya
And now I'm sitting in between my mates but feeling older
They told me Ethan wouldn’t do a thing so I'll keep my head up
But now it's been too long it's twice the time oh I had enough
Of being strong and weak at the same time I was sitting ducks
Waiting for the confidence I had in you to bite me in the bum
But you told me Ethan wouldn't do a thing so i kept my head up

Then i saw you in the car
Looked over there in the harbor's side
I couldn't see but i recognized
I should've known you were a house of lies
The weight is pulled off of your seat
But at the end it just adds up to his
Two shades high off a gateway drug
You and Ethan did a thing do I still keep my head up
The worst part of it all was that you weren’t
Intoxicated no excuses you could pull in
To save yourself and now you come back to me crawling
I don’t know how you think that I could ever forgive
Someone who won't admit when she’s fallen
Why don't you just run back to funny little Ethan
Stop asking me to trust you while I'm still coughing
All of the water from this pool you made me drown in

It's been two hours from the time we set our clocks to meet up
If you had only gave me time I swear I could of told ya
And now I’m sitting in between my mates but feeling older
They told me Ethan wouldn't do a thing so I'll keep my head up
But now it's been too long it's twice the time oh I had enough
Of being strong and weak at the same time I was sitting ducks
Waiting for the confidence I had in you to bite me in the bum
But you told me Ethan wouldn't do a thing so i kept my head up

Then i saw you in the car
Looked over there in the harbor's side
I couldn't see but I recognized
I should've known you were a house of lies
The weight is pulled off of your seat
But at the end it just adds up to his
Two shades high off a gateway drug
You and Ethan did a thing do i still keep my head up
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Then i saw you in the car
Looked over there in the harbor's side
I couldn't see but i recognized
I should've known you were a house of lies
The weight is pulled off of your seat
But at the end it just adds up to his
Two shades high off a gateway drug
You and Ethan did a thing was i just not enough
