Hey, how are you doing?
I just wanted to say that I miss you, I guess
And I'm sorry
Call me back
Bye

So tell me how I'm supposed to feel now
60 over the limit just 'cause I can
They say, "You know, you gotta slow down
There's no coming back"
So young and restless, I'm a cliché, yeah
But it's easier said than done

And I can't keep waiting here
I'm just aging
So I'm gone
Such a shame, and

Baby, I'm leaving
Before tomorrow comes
I don't believe in saying "I'm never coming home"
But I'm drawing the line
And say whatever you like
But I'm leaving
I'm letting go of all I've ever known
So falling in and falling out fast
I'm burning up, I can't believe this got old so fast
And I'm done with feeling like I'm told I should
'Cause it's a feeling I'm chasing
And I ain't found it here in a while

But I can't keep waiting here
I'm just aging
So I'm gone
Such a shame, and

Baby, I'm leaving
Before tomorrow comes
I don't believe in saying "I'm never coming home"
But I'm drawing the line
And say whatever you like
But I'm leaving
I'm letting go of all I've ever known

'Cause I'm leaving
'Cause I'm leaving
'Cause I'm leaving
'Cause I'm leaving
'Cause I'm leaving
