Green light, what’s it gonna be like
Hustle with the A Team, hitters on the B side
Niggas never realise, what we live in real life
Hitters on the B side, waiting for the green light

Niggas don't realise, (ohh-ohh-ohh)
What we live in real life, (ohh-ohh-ohh)
Hitters on the B side, (ohh-ohh-ohh)
Waiting for the green light (ohh-ohh-ohh)

Boom, yo it's all fun and games
'Til it ain't fun and games anymore
'Til the place ain't safe anymore
All I gotta make is one phone call
It don't take any more
I don't make mistakes anymore
I'm the one and only they don't make any more
I'm praying that I don't catch a case anymore
Just came off of tour, way before I ever done a show
Had to make sure the bag was secure
I come through in LV or Christian Dior
I'm at a gun range saying "Big man, I did this before"
And I still sell bricks to the road
And I still couldn't give two shits 'bout the load
I still roll with the .35
'Cause I really live the street life
And if I catch you at the red light
You ain't gonna see the green light

Niggas don't realise, (ohh-ohh-ohh)
What we live in real life, (ohh-ohh-ohh)
Hitters on the B side, (ohh-ohh-ohh)
Waiting for the green light (ohh-ohh-ohh)

I'm in industry meetings, trap phone's beeping
Only big figures that we speaking
Front row seating, Rated Awards at the ???
Coming like it's real nigga season
I've lost count all the times I lost count
But I'm juggin', my brother, we never washed out
And all my brothers lurk me to free up
You wouldn't believe me if I told you my re-up
Game changed so I had to switch pace
Never see me wear if it ain't a big face
My fam are really in the field
Stop asking 'bout my mixtape
I just beat my sixth case
Fans know what the Gs like
Might end up on a peak night
And I wore the red top
If I get the green light

Niggas don't realise, (ohh-ohh-ohh)
But we live a real life, (ohh-ohh-ohh)
Hitters on the B side, (ohh-ohh-ohh)
Waiting for the green light (ohh-ohh-ohh)

They just oughta change things
God blessed all my pagans
I nearly lost my patience (ohh-ohh)
What's it gonna be like?
Niggas never realise
Hitters on the B side
