Your hands on my skin
But I can't feel a thing, wish I could let you in
Poison in my veins
Is taking over me, and baby I can't breathe

In the wishing well I throw pennies, throw pennies
Wishing they would be magic, be magic
And you deserve some good loving, good loving
So baby don't you wait for me, wait for me

'Cause I'm incapable of falling for you, why
Nothing else that I'd rather do, I
But the ones I end up with are the ones that shoot me dead
Incapable of falling for you

Waiting to be sane
And baby you're a saint, so maybe I'm insane
When love equals pain
It's hard for you to change, and love somebody safe

In the wishing well I throw pennies, throw pennies
Wishing they would be magic, be magic
And you deserve some good loving, good loving
So baby don't you wait for me, wait for me
'Cause I'm incapable of falling for you, why
Nothing else that I'd rather do, I
But the ones I end up with are the ones that shoot me dead
Incapable of falling for you
'Cause I'm incapable of falling for you, why
Nothing else that I'd rather do, I
But the ones I end up with are the ones that shoot me dead
Incapable of falling for you

Your hands on my skin
But I can't feel a thing, wish I could let you in
I'm incapable of falling for you
I'm incapable of falling for you
Incapable of falling for you
I'm incapable, I'm incapable

'Cause I'm incapable of falling for you, why
Nothing else that I'd rather do, I
But the ones I end up with are the ones that shoot me dead
Incapable of falling for you
Why, I
But the ones I end up with are the ones that shoot me dead
Incapable of falling for you
