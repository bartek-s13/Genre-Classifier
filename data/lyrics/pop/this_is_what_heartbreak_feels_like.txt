<<<<<<< HEAD
Crawling down the street
Used to be bright
And I hoped to god
The cracks would shed some light
Further into this old story town
You'd think that I could tell you more
But there’s none

To tell you
What I would do
To turn the table
But I don't wanna turn to what you are becoming
And I see
All you've done for me
If you’d told me this would end as soon as it all started
I would have found the rest of me
But I guess I'm just not there

I would, I wou-wou-would, ooh
I would

I would've found it quicker but you came
In a foreign way I'm thankful for the days
When you played with my heart, all the pain
Built up in my lungs halfway
And now, I know the words that left our names

I've gotta tell you
What I would do
To turn the table
But I don't wanna turn to what you are becoming
And I see
All you've done for me
If you'd told me this would end as soon as it all started
I would have found the rest of me
But I guess I’m just not there

Give your heart but keep your head
Give your heart but keep your head up, now
Give your heart but keep your head
Give your heart but keep your head up, now
Give your heart but keep your head
Give your heart but keep your head up, now
Give your heart but keep your head
Give your heart but keep your head

I wanna tell you
What I would do
Yo turn the table
But I don’t want to turn to what you are becoming
And I see
All you've done for me
If you’d told me this would end as soon as it all started
I would have found the rest of me
But I guess I'm just not there

I would, I wou-wou-would
I would, I wou-wou-would, ooh
I would, I wou-wou-wou-would
