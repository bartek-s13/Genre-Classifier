I had a feeling, you couldn't be found
I was tired and getting struck down
I never saw you coming my way
I'm so, I'm so distracted
Infatuated
And now I see you running away

Well it's all I know
It's all I know

Remember the fine night air
Didn't I show I care?
I do, oh I do
Remember the white knight stare
Didn't I show I care?
I do, oh I do

And I know, you're angered
By the stories you're told
They blackened my name
It doesn't make a difference at all
So stay, if only I can try to explain
Then we'll have it all
It might stop slipping away

Well it's all I know
It's all I know

Remember the fine night air
Didn't I show I care?
I do, oh I do
Remember the white knight stare
Didn't I show I care?
I do, oh I do

Wishes like a cold wind on my face
Wishes I could warm a frozen lake
Oh wishes, I'm wishing you away
It's late, the light flickers off from the rain
And it stains on my heart
I wonder, do you feel the same
As you did at the start?

Remember the fine night air
Didn't I show I care?
I do, oh I do
Remember the white knight stare
Didn't I show I care?
I do, oh I do

Wishes like a cold wind on my face
Wishes I could warm a frozen lake
Oh wishes, I'm wishing you away
