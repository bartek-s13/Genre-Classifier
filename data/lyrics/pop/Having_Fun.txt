I know it’s lonely
But it’s alright I don’t know where I’m going
Why so slowly?
I turn around and tear the stitch I’m sowing
Ask if I care, I’ll tell you one thing
Ask if I’ll share, and I’ll start running
Personally I’m done
Having Fun
So do you see me
Eye to eye, or falling in completely
If I were to step outside (woah)
Haven’t I shared too much of one thing
Haven’t I paired us with the wrong thing
Personally I’m done
Having Fun
Saturday it’s gone, so fast
No worries. No laughs
