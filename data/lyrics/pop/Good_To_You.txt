<<<<<<< HEAD
I've been stuck in mourning
Waiting for the beat
I've been running circles
Searching for the key
A message in a bottle
Floating in the sea
Giving me the answers
Giving all I need

And the thought of your love is enough to give me the answers
And I hate waking up when I know that it's not with you
Give me a chance
Cause darling I've been loving all the things that you do
Tell me you love me
And I'll be good to you
Oh yeah
I'll be good to you babe
I'll be good to you

I was in the mountains
Sheltered in the trees
Following the rhythm
Following the breeze
And that was where you found me
Found me in the rain
Took me through the valley
And you took away my pain
Oh the thought of your love is enough to give me the answers
And I hate waking up when I know that it's not with you
Give me a chance
Cause darling I've been loving all the things that you do
Tell me you love me
And I'll be good to you

Oh
Just tell me you love me babe
