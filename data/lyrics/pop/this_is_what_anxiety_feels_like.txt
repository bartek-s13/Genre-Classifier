Ooh, mm
Ooh, mm
Ooh, mm

Bones shake the cold starts to kick in
Getting harder to breathe again
Any longer, I’ll need a friend
Trying to keep my composure but
All I do is fall on the ground
So much noise I don’t hear a sound

And all of the words once in me
They slowly start to realize
That the room filled up with teardrops from my eyes
Oh I feel my body shaking
No hope is being kept alive
The fear of losin' more than just my mind

Ooh, mm
Ooh, mm
Ooh, mm
Ooh, mm
I can't breathe
I can’t sleep
What is this feeling I feel inside of me?
I can't breathe
I can’t sleep
What is this feeling I feel inside of me, oh
I can't breathe (ooh, mm)
I can’t sleep
What is this feeling I feel inside of me? (ooh, mm)
I can't breathe, (ooh, mm)
I can't sleep
What is this feeling I feel inside of me? (ooh, mm)
I can't breathe
I can't sleep
What is this feeling I feel inside of me?
I can't breathe
I can't sleep
What is this feeling I feel inside of me?
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
