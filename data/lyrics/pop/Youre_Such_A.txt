You keep calling, you keep calling
Saying that you want it back
All my loving, all my loving

With that sweet talk on your tongue
But I'm not buying, I'm not buying

Yeah, you ripped it up and you chewed it
And the more you talk, you prove it
Yeah, you prove it

Did you think that I would let you
Crawl right back into my bedroom
After everything we've been through

Without you now

You can take your lies to your next girlfriend
'Cause I don't want to hear it anymore
And if you're all that's left when the whole world ends
