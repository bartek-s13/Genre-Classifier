My brain must not be screwed in right
It's like I cry while I rip the wings off butterflies
Tried to capture that same feeling 'bout a thousand times
'Cause I let it go and I let it keep me up all night

If we met when we were thirty-two
Then maybe I'd be good for you
But every time I love someone
It's like I'm in a deja-vu
I blamed it on mental health
I blamed it on lack of wealth
I blamed it on distance
I blamed it on everybody else
The things you say I make you feel
Heard them all before somehow
Now I see it's me who fucks up everything all by myself

I'm sorry for loving you
I hate myself for leaving too
I wish that I had an excuse
But I'm sorry for loving you
I've been sorry from the start
Build you up to fall apart
I can't explain the things that I do
But I'm sorry for loving you
When I try, I only make it worse
I never cry but that doesn't mean I never hurt
Trust me when I say that you don't want my love, it's cursed
It's darker than dark
But it was real, for what it's worth

Mmm, it looks like I'm collecting exes
Eating hearts for breakfast
I must fall in love for fun
Sit back and look at what I've done
You think I'm proud of making you cry?
I can see why I've done it so many times
Stubbornness made me heartless
Turning my back after we fight
When water's cold, I let them drown
Same words out a different mouth
Now I see it's me who fucks up everything all by myself

I'm sorry for loving you
I hate myself for leaving too
I wish that I had an excuse
But I'm sorry for loving you
I've been sorry from the start
Build you up to fall apart
I can't explain the things that I do
But I'm sorry for loving you
I try but I'm no different
'Cause I like to get my way
And I'd die before I listen
I never learn from my mistakes

I'm sorry for loving you
I hate myself for leaving too
I wish that I had an excuse
But I'm sorry for loving you
I've been sorry from the start
Build you up to fall apart
I can't explain the things that I do
But I'm sorry for loving you
