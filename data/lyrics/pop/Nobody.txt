Lie awake
With only my pillow to hold close
To me
Don't know why
I guess that it still smells like you
And me

No, I'm not saying that we should try again
But how much further would it hurt to pretend?
That maybe we could make it work out in the end
'Cause now I'm sitting all alone in this room
With no one left to fuck me up like you do
I always hope you could use somebody too

Yeah, you know me
Like no-no-nobody
Like no-no-nobody
Nobody
Yeah, you know me
Like no-no-nobody
Like no-no-nobody
Nobody

I am lost
Without your light showing me
The way
Never realised
I owe to you who I am
Today

No, I'm not saying that we should try again
But how much further would it hurt to pretend?
That maybe we could make it work out in the end
'Cause now I'm sitting all alone in this room
With no one left to fuck me up like you do
I always hope you could use somebody too

Yeah, you know me

Yeah, you know me

Yeah, you know me
Like no-no-nobody
