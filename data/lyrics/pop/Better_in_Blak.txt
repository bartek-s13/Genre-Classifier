Do you know what it feels like?
To get calls in the middle of the night?
Saying you're not worth it, you deserve it
Go on, have another drink
Do you know what it feels like?
To get stuck in the middle of a fight?
Screaming you're not worth it, you deserve it
Go on, have another drink

But if I just keep quiet
I'll be the one whose lying too
Why should I keep hiding, always crying?
Tell me what did I do?

You took the colour from me, darling, I'll get it back
I'll get it back, I'll get it back, I'll get it back, I'll get it back
You took the colour from me, but I look better in blak
If I knew what I know now, maybe I would take it back
But fuck that, I look better in blak

Do you know what it feels like?
To be told that you are never right?
If I had a lighter skin maybe I would win
Does it make you want to think?
Do you know what it feels like?
Cos I know what it feels like!
If I had a lighter skin maybe I would win
Does it make you want to think?
But if I just keep quiet
I'll be the one whose lying too
Why should I keep hiding, always crying?
Tell me what did I do?

You took the colour from me, darling, I'll get it back
I'll get it back, I'll get it back, I'll get it back, I'll get it back
You took the colour from me, but I look better in blak
If I knew what I know now, maybe I would take it back
But fuck that, I look better in blak

Hey! I look better in blak
Hey! I look better in blak
If I knew what I know now, maybe I would take it back
