<<<<<<< HEAD
I saw your shoes behind the line
I’ve seen your face a hundred times
But now only in my mind
The rest of you is left behind
You lay there passed out on the couch
Words falling from your mouth
Maybe you like to drink too much
I could see you losing touch

Please don’t float too high
The sun will burn your wings
You are everything
Please just run away
The headlights they will catch you
Your mother she will miss you

So we all waited in a room
Flipped a switch and watched the news
Waiting for a sign of you
Breathing was impossible to do
So we all waited for the call
And wondered if you’re there at all
But no one’s lips knew what to say
Hoping that you won’t fly away
Please don’t float too high
The sun will burn your wings
You are everything
Please just run away
The headlights they will catch you
Your mother she will miss you

Please don’t float too high
The sun will burn your wings
You are everything
Please just run away
The headlights they will catch you
