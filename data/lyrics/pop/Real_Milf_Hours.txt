Aye, I'm lookin' for a 50 year old goth bitch with fake nails, the fuck you talkin' 'bout?
She gotta have them bags under her eyes, you know what I'm sayin'? A real working class hoe
(Billy!)

Rippin' and dippin' it all I've been gettin' is cream so I'm whippin' it
Countin' up commas, I think that I'm gettin' it
Thought I'd be broke but I guess I'm the opposite
Jump in this bitch goin'
Straight to the top and shit
Straight to the top and shit
Straight to the top and shit
Straight to the top and shit
Bad little bitch and she givin' me top and shit
All of these haters just jump the fuck off my dick
If you don’t like my shit find a tall cliff and just jump the fuck off that shit (Hmm, Yeah!)
Almost got a milli' that shit like "Woah!"
If you a bad bitch I might suck your toes
And if you a little thick I might suck your rolls
Bitch like "Damn!"
"You're the fucking man"
All around the world, yeah my shit's the fucking jam
Running up a check (Ay) I'm gettin' to the bands
Still got bad bitches rollin' blunts in the sand
Bitch I might be out here shoppin' witcho granny
You don't know what the fuck I'm doin'

I don’t give a fuck i'm ignorant
Try to tell me I ain't makin' it
Watch the come up we on one
But I don’t give a fuck still sad as shit
Got a goth bitch dancin' on my dick
But I don't gotta hit it I'm lazy
Fucked a bad bitch named daisy
Sippin' on tea witcho lady
Bring the milf hoes to the party
50 and up get it poppin', damn
Billy just went thrift shoppin'
Found some fake Gucci, I copped it
I’m rich as a bitch, still steal shit
Find me in target with your main bitch
Sippin' on tea from the market
My music is fucking garbage
(laughing)
