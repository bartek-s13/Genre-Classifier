You only called me your baby when she wasn't there
Now you go calling me crazy because I don't care

We'll never turn back time, now loving you is an afterthought
Too late to press rewind when all I wanna do, do is sob

I gotta break you free
Don't know why you'd ever say love
Knowing I'd never be enough
Breaking the best part of me
Why do I let you do me like that?
Can't keep pulling you back to me
Me, me, me, me
Can't keep pulling you back to me
Me, me, me, me

I'll never trust you after the things that I saw
Who wants an ever after if it ain't forever at all

We'll never turn back time, now loving you is an afterthought
Too late to press rewind when all I wanna do, do is sob
I gotta break you free
Don't know why you'd ever say love
Knowing I'd never be enough
Breaking the best part of me
Why do I let you do me like that?
Can't keep pulling you back to me
Me, me, me, me
Can't keep pulling you back to me
Me, me, me, me

You'll never be the one
Cause it's not how it's supposed to be
I'll pull you back, pull you back, pull you back to me
I don't want your love
Baby, we were never meant to be
It's not enough, so you're gonna have to break free
Never be the one
Cause it's not how it's supposed to be
I'll pull you back, pull you back, pull you back to me
I don't want your love
Baby, we were never meant to be
It's not enough, so you're gonna have to break free

I gotta break you free
Don't know why you'd ever say love
Knowing I'd never be enough
Breaking the best part of me
Why do I let you do me like that?
Can't keep pulling you back to me
Me, me, me, me
Can't keep pulling you back to me
Me, me, me, me
You only called me your baby when she wasn't there
