There's a girl in the backyard bangin' on her drum
Sitting in a junkpile laughing at the sun
Singing Ah Ah Ah I just wanna be a rockstar
There's a boy in the backseat singing to the song
Playing on the radio knowing he's the one
Singing Ah Ah Ah I just wanna be a rockstar

Singing Ah Ah Ah I was born to be a rockstar

There's a girl in the treetop looking at the stars
Waiting for a touchdown coming in from Mars
Thinking, Is There Anybody Out There?
There's a boy thinking of her playing his guitar
Searching for the answer buried in his heart
Thinking Ah Ah Ah Is There Anybody Out There?
Bridge 2:
Singing Ah Ah Ah Is There Anybody Out There?
Chorus:
If There's a meaning can you show me a sign
The more I look it just gets harder to find
The world is spinning and I wanna know why

And we're all getting older wishing we were young
Hanging on the memory of what we would be become
Singing Ah Ah Ah I was born to be a rockstar
Bridge 3:
Singing Ah Ah Ah I just wanna be a rockstar
Singing Ah Ah Ah I was born to be a rockstar
Chorus 2:
If There's a meaning can you show me a sign
The more I look it just gets harder to find
The world is spinning and I wanna know why
And maybe we will never figure it out
I got a feeling that's what life's all about
I'm learning anything is possible now
Breakdown:
Take a ticket and get off of line
Take a ticket and get off the line
Take a ticket and get off of line
Take a ticket and get off the line
So take a ticket and get off of line
Take a ticket and get off the line
So take a ticket and get off of line
So take a ticket and get off the line
Outro:
Singing Ah Ah Ah I was born to be a rockstar
Singing Ah Ah Ah I was born to be a rockstar
Singing Ah Ah Ah I just wanna be a rockstar
Singing Ah Ah Ah I was born to be a rockstar
