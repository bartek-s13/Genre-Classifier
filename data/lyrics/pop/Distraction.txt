<<<<<<< HEAD
I can see that you been hurtin'
Baby, don't beat yourself up
Be right here with me now (Be right here with me now)
All of your tears, he ain't worth 'em
Well, yeah, that isn't love

I'm right here with you now
Just let it all go, and I'll pull you close
We'll take it real slow
Baby, we can shut the world out
Oh, yeah

I'll be your distraction, your distraction
I'll be your distraction, your distraction
'Cause he don't even matter, even matter
Baby, we can shut the world out

There's no need for second guessin'
I'm here to pick you back up
Be right here with me now (Be right here with me now)
My love, it don't come with stressin'
I give you more than enough
I'm right here with you now
Just let it all go, and I'll pull you close
We'll take it real slow
Baby, we can shut the world out

I'll be your distraction, your distraction
I'll be your distraction, your distraction
'Cause he don't even matter, even matter
Baby, we can shut the world out

Yeah, it's like passive aggression, turn to passion, I'm so distracted
You're stuck in traffic, but wanna move on and break the habit
It ain't gon' happen, unless you let me take the reins
No shame, come have a glass of this jack
And get out your jacket, I'll show you just who Jack is
What's good? How's your day been?
Everything I'm sayin for the sake of replacin' them thoughts in your brain 'bout that fuckboy
Who played you like your love was a game
I can't sit back, be frank
I can't sit here and watch you in pain 'cause I was here to save you
And all he did was drop the ball and break you
You say you want somethin' real, girl that makes two of us
Aye, so let's vibe, no strings attached, I'm just tryin' to distract you from him
I'ma catch you every time, it's me plus you, just do the math
You'll be fine, you'll be fine, you'll be fine
I'll be your distraction, your distraction
I'll be your distraction, your distraction
'Cause he don't even matter, even matter
Baby, we can shut the world out
I'll be your distraction, your distraction
I'll be your distraction, your distraction
'Cause he don't even matter, even matter
Baby, we can shut the world out
