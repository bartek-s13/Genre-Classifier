Oh-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-uh, oh-ooh-oh
Oh-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-uh-uh-uh, oh-uh

I've been thinking about you lately
You're on my mind
You do something to me, baby
In ways, I can't define

Whatever you're doing, you're doing it well
What is your secret? Won't you please tell?
'Cause my head is spinning, spinning around
If you let me know, boy, I won't let you down

You put a spell on me, I don't know what to do
It's an ability that draws me closer to you
Your magic has got me where I want to be
Your magic is happening in front of me

There's a power within you, baby
It's controlling me
I know there's no need to fight it
I let it be

Whatever you're doing, you're doing it well

It's an ability that draws me closer to you
Your magic has got me where I want to be
Your magic is happening in front of me

Can you feel the power lurking, baby girl?
I think the spell is working, oh-oh
Can you feel the power lurking, baby girl? (Can you feel it?)
I think the spell is working, oh-oh

You put a spell on me, I don't know what to do
It's an ability that draws me closer to you
