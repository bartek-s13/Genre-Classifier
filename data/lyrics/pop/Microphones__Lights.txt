Hey future, you're not my friend
You are far away from here
But close enough to fear
I think I think too much in the end
Of the footprint I will make
And every step I'll never take, oh
Please future, give me more time
Please, you show me how I, I, I've been
Hiding behind microphones and lights, and lights
Because I'm terrified of the unknown tonight, tonight
Wish I could live what I preach and be done
But I am imperfectly just someone
Hiding behind microphones and lights, and lights
Hey future, I'm wondering why
Why it's been my necessity
To be my worst enemy
But I'm finding so much to glorify
'Cause with all of this room to grow
I know I'm loved even so
Please future, give me more time
Please, you show me how I, I, I've been
Hiding behind microphones and lights, and lights
Because I'm terrified of the unknown tonight, tonight
Wish I could live what I preach and be done
But I am imperfectly just someone
Hiding behind microphones and lights, and lights
Hiding behind microphones and lights, and lights
Because I'm terrified of the unknown tonight, tonight
Wish I could live what I preach and be done
But I am imperfectly just someone
Hiding behind microphones and lights, and lights
