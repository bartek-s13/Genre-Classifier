<<<<<<< HEAD
Somebody came into this house
And tucked their heart inside your chest
I won't whisper who it was
But he's laying in your bed

Somebody came into this house
They smelled of wine and cheap cigars
They drank the liquor by your bed
And they're your demon at the bar

Your demon at the bar

Somebody came into this house
And left a trail of blood and salt
I won't whisper who it was
But his heart is made of coal

Somebody came into this house
Upon their head a crown of thorns
As every winter came and left
They're not leaving you alone
