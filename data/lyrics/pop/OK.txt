You look you could be a Tyra
Or an Amanda
All that I know is that you’re beautiful
You look like you should be a Tina
Or a Selena
So why you alone girl I just wanna know

Girl I don’t know what your name is
But I see you looking down
I really don’t know what your man did
But he left you with a frown
I know it might sound a little crazy
But please let me inside
I really don’t know what the case is
But I want you to dry your eyes

No woman, no cry
Cause tonight is gonna be alright
You gonna be ok
No woman, no cry
Cause tonight I’m gonna make it right
We gonna be ok
Everything’s gonna be ok
No woman, no cry

You look like you could be a Lisa
Or a Theresa
I don’t think you know but you should be with me
You look like you could be a Lindsay
Maybe an Ashley
I’m in no hurry, I’m waiting patiently

Girl I don’t know what your name is
But I see you looking down
I really don’t know what your man did
But he left you with a frown
I know it might sound a little crazy
But please let me inside
I really don’t know what the case is
But I want you to dry your eyes

No woman, no cry
Cause tonight is gonna be alright
You gonna be ok
No woman, no cry
Cause tonight I’m gonna make it right
We gonna be ok
Everything’s gonna be ok
No woman, no cry

Oh every time he breaks your heart, I’ll take your pain away
Don’t you cry, don’t you, don’t you cry
I just want to chase those clouds and bring you brighter days
Don’t you cry, don’t you don’t you cry
Don’t you cry, don’t you don’t you cry
Don’t you cry, don’t you don’t you cry
Don’t you cry, don’t you don’t you cry
Don’t you cry
Because
It’s ok

No woman, no cry
Cause tonight is gonna be alright
You gonna be ok
No woman, no cry
Cause tonight I’m gonna make it right
We gonna be ok
Everything’s gonna be ok
