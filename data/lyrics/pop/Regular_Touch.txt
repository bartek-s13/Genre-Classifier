Everyone knows the kind of girl
Who needs that
Regular touch or someone
Who wants them
Somebody fine and always around
To give some
Never disowned or on her own
To know that

It's okay to step away from
Someone long term, beat your own drum
Feel secure in your own skin
Love from within, time to begin

Now she's alone
Dancing like nobody is home
Free on her own
Not attached, and ready to roam
Now she's alone
Dancing like nobody is home
Don't need nobody that much
Don't need no regular touch

Don't—Don't need no regular touch

Anxiety grows and changes all
That she thought
Now being apart with no one beside her
Is hard work
And time moves on, and he has left
Her wanting
She was lost in his web
But now she knows that

It's okay to step away from
Someone long term, beat your own drum
Feel secure in your own skin
Love from within, time to begin

Now she's alone
Dancing like nobody is home
Free on her own
Not attached, and ready to roam
Now she's alone
Dancing like nobody is home
Don't need nobody that much
Don't need no regular touch

Don't—Don't need no regular touch

Don't need no regular touch
Don't need no regular touch
Don't—Don't need no regular touch
