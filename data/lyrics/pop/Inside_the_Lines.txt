Worried sky
In need of something green to sleep at night
Aiming high
We're living restless, but it's you and I

Can see we are the shade, the fire and rain
True work of art is not a thing we change
Aiming high
We're living restless, but it's you and I

Tried to keep our colours
Inside the lines, inside the lines
But it's hard to draw emotions
In troubled minds, inside the lines

Bold and brave
Compared to others, we just paint them grey, uh
Here to stay
Know that the two of us won't fade away

Can see we are the shade, the fire and rain
True work of art is not a thing we change
Hard to hide
You move me like the moon that pulls the tide
Tried to keep our colours
Inside the lines, inside the lines
But it's hard to draw emotions
