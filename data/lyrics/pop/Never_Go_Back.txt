I never go back, no, no, no
I never go, I never go back
I never go back, no, no, no
I never go, I never go back

It's not my baby, not the girl I knew then
Not the girl I know now, anymore
I wanna leave you, "Baby don’t you leave me
Baby don't you love me? Mi amor"

Always look around girl, try to see the good things
Why you always say that you've never done wrong?
"Why you never hold me? Tell me that you love me
Why you always say that you’d never let go?"

I never go back, no, no, no
I never go, I never go back
I never go back, no, no, no
I never go, I never go back

I wanna do this, "I don't wanna do this"
Girl, we shouldn't do this anymore"
"Quiero dejarte, no me necesitas?
Por que siempre dices, eso mi amor?"
