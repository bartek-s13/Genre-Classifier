I turned my Starcaster to a star catcher
Might visit nostalgia and chip my sanity
Still one with the heat of cigar ember
At peace with knowing I could leave forever tomorrow
I’m on the brink of nirvana, I’m so omniscient
See all and I’m a miss you
I’m overseas and still haven’t seen God
That brother MIA as fuck
My mama pray for me often bet she probably
Shake my luck, I been surrounded by crosses ever since I could look
Up on the balcony, smell the sea and the breeze
And if you ever did doubt on me, I would truly hate to be you
Honestly it’s me and my family on the easel
So that’s the reason I see some people that's see through
You fuckin’ phonies, I keep my distance and piece with it
Sounds mad wavy, get eargasms or seasickness
Leave em’ with an imprint deeper than OGs did it
No overdose but still hella OD
Still hella OD

The shore seems small when you're up this high
And air stays cold with the changing tides
The feeling's strange knowing you've arrived
The path behind, star catcher’s twine
That’s life

Back to the madness, fasten your seats
I had a dream I had to battle the reaper halfway deceased
On the beach in the winter with ominous clouds east
Dishonor puts me at ease, Obama print on my ‘Preme
And I Love Ugly on me like potassium in Belize
Mad organic beats said my competition was me
So now I don’t feel inclined or responsible to appease
Niggas wishes got me wishing I thought like this from the beginning
Oi
Love is not a game, it’s not a toy
I stay in my lane so I enjoy life
People switching up got me annoyed
Fuck it

Souls grow public in domain
When dreams take place in conscious planes
If god was real, it was pre-ordained
Then who's to say what's real or fate
So looking back on a later day
The shoreline gone with the climate's change
If merit lied in the work you made
Then take some peace knowing you had things worth saying
