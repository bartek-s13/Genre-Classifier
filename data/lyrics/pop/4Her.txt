<<<<<<< HEAD
Am I playin' it safe?
I've been here for too long
Have I made a mistake?
Is the reason I stay
Cause I feel so alone?
Make up reasons to wait
Run so nothing goes wrong
But everything that she said
I'm overthinkin'
While I'm driving back home

Cause she said
"Call me up when you're all alone
Cause I'm down for hanging out"
We'll stay up all night
And I'll just crash on your couch
"Call me up when you're all alone
Cause I'm down for hanging out"
Keep tellin' myself

Maybe that's her, that's the girl
I've been tryna find
Maybe that's her, that's the girl
I'm just terrified
Maybe that's her, how will I know
If I never try?
Maybe that's her, that's the girl
That's the girl
I've been waiting for
I've been waiting for

Am I playin' it safe?
I don't know anymore
Do I keep pushin' away
Cause I'm just too afraid
That someone's gonna get her

Cause she said
"Call me up when you're all alone
Cause I'm down for hanging out"
We'll stay up all night
And I'll just crash on your couch
"Call me up when you're all alone
Cause I'm down for hanging out"
Keep tellin' myself

Maybe that's her, that's the girl
I've been tryna find
Maybe that's her, that's the girl
I'm just terrified
Maybe that's her, how will I know
If I never try?
Maybe that's her, that's the girl
That's the girl
I've been waiting for
I've been waiting for

Am I playin' it safe?
Is she waitin' for me?

Cause maybe that's her, that's the girl
I've been tryna find
Maybe that's her, that's the girl
I'm just terrified (I'm just terrified!)
Maybe that's her, how will I know
If I never try?
Maybe that's her, that's the girl
That's the girl (That's the girl!)
I've been waiting for
I've been waiting for
I've been waiting for
I've been waiting for
