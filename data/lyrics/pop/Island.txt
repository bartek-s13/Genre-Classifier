Almost so perfect
The way that I want you
I'm almost deserving
When I get close to you
I disappear
Lost in the waves
I go under
Under

I am an Island
You are the ocean
We're so close, we're touching
Completely surrounded
But I cannot have you
The way that I want to
Cuz I am an island
You are the ocean
No I cannot have you
I cannot have you
Without drowning

My breath is shallow
I just can't catch it
My heart is breaking
Feel the waves crashing
A new storm is building
If it reaches land, I'll go under
Under
Cause I am an Island
You are the ocean
We're so close, we're touching
Completely surrounded
But I cannot have you
The way that I want to
Cause I am an island
You are the ocean
No I cannot have you
I cannot have you
Without drowning

I see you out there
I'm lost in the blue
I'm part of your world but
I cannot have you
Cause I am deserted
And you are too deep
I cannot love you
Without losing me

I am an Island
You are the ocean
We're so close, we're touching
Completely surrounded!
But I cannot have you
The way that I want to
Cause I am an island
You are the ocean
No I cannot have you
I cannot have you
