I miss you, yeah I kinda miss you
You're never picking up oh that's the issue
You just kickin' it with old friends
Got you in a new Benz
Saying how you're just friends

I just don't buy it
You're so used to lying
I tell you I'm fine but I'm not
Why can't we try it
Cause I swear I'm dying
Admit that I want you up front
Want you up front
Admit that I want you up front

Well maybe it's the way I think about you when I can't sleep
Maybe it's the reason that I play a song on repeat
Either way I hear your name whenever there's a heartbeat
I know you're screaming
Baby I can't speak up
I can't speak up
Baby I can't speak up
But you just won't listen
You say that you're different from me
But I'm sure that you're not
We've grown so distant
I'm done reminiscing
So baby let's fall back in love
Fall back in love
Baby let's fall back in love

I miss you, yeah I kinda miss you
Just can't speak up
I want you up front
I miss you, yeah I kinda miss you
I want you up front
I want you up front
