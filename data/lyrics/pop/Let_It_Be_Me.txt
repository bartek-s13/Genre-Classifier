I'll lie to you if you want me to
I’ll tell the truth 'cause sometimes you need it
I'll have your back when it hurts to ask
When you get mad, don’t know the reason

For the days when it's hard to wake up
For the nights you don't fall asleep
For the times when you feel the greatest
And the worlds sitting at your feet
For the good and the bad and the ugly
And everything in between
You're gonna need somebody

So let it be me
Let it be me
You're gonna need somebody
You're gonna need somebody
Let it be me
Let it be me
You're gonna need somebody
You're gonna need somebody
Let it be me
(Gonna need somebody)
(Gonna need somebody)

I’ll break your fall when you need to fall
I’ll take it all so you won't feel it
I’ll pick you up, take you for a drive
When you wanna forget and just feel alive

For the days when it's hard to wake up
For the nights you don't fall asleep
For the times when you feel the greatest
And the worlds sitting at your feet
For the good and the bad and the ugly
And everything in between
You're gonna need somebody

So let it be me
Let it be me
You’re gonna need somebody
You're gonna need somebody
Let it be me
Let it be me
You're gonna need somebody
You're gonna need somebody
Let it be me
(Gonna need somebody)
(Gonna need somebody)
(Gonna need somebody)
(Gonna need somebody)

Form the ups and the downs and the nothings
When you feel like you're missing that something
When you're feeling high or coming down
I'll be around
I'll take the now with the past and the future
You can lose me but I'll never lose you
When you're feeling high or coming down

Let it be me
Let it be me
You're gonna need somebody
You're gonna need somebody
Let it be me
Let it be me
You're gonna need somebody
You're gonna need somebody
Let it be me
Let it be me (you're gonna need somebody)
Let it be me (you're gonna need somebody)
Let it be me (you're gonna need somebody)
Let it be me (you're gonna need somebody)
Let it be me
