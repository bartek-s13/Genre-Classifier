The polaroid pictures on the wall
The memories captured feel so small
They're gone, so gone
Maybe we tried so hard to be
Someone to fulfill each other's needs
Now we can't breathe

Every time we take it slow
I fuck it up, I lose control
Making me feel like letting me go
Or maybe you should
All this checking on my phone
Girl, you should just mind your own
Making me feel like letting you go
Or maybe I should

But then we're on the coffee table, covered in sweat
With your hands all over, kissing my neck
We know (We know, we know)
Or no
'Cause this is getting so unstable, we should break up
But the coffee table's where we end up
We know (We know, we know)
Or no (Or no, or no)
I don't wanna be a jealous guy
But you make it hard for me sometimes
Your show can't go on
You're calling me late, drunk and alone
Saying, "This time I'm moving on"
But girl, it's getting old

Every time we take it slow
I fuck it up, I lose control
Making me feel like letting me go
Or maybe you should
All this checking on my phone
Girl, you should just mind your own
Making me feel like letting you go
Or maybe I should

But then we're on the coffee table covered in sweat
With your hands all over, kissing my neck
We know (We know, we know)
Or no
'Cause this is getting so unstable, we should break up
But the coffee table's where we end up
We know (We know, we know)
Or no
No, I don't wanna be strangers
Although, we should probably lay low
(Don't wanna have to) Leave us
'Cause I still wanna keep ya
But you're making me feel like letting you go
So maybe I should

But then we're on the coffee table covered in sweat
With your hands all over, kissing my neck
We know (We know, we know)
Or no
'Cause this is getting so unstable, we should break up
But the coffee table's where we end up
We know (We know, we know)
Oh, no, no, yeah

Hey (We know, we know), coffee table, ay
Hey, oh, the coffee table's where we end up
Hey, we know, we know, we know it
Hey, we know, we know, we know
