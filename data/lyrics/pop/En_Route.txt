Not every hero wears a cape
Be my Keisha, I'm your Ace
Share the key, you take a break
Touch down in your base
They cut the bag then I go, drop the bag when I'm home

Buckle, buckle, buckle up
Drop top getting top

Go on check me after 8, in the day there's a lot
Tell me when you leave your bae, I need to fit you in a spot
Your body looking like a drug (muah)
Tell me what it is about it, put your money where your mouth is
A1 like I'm Marvin, leave the group like I'm Marvin
VVS on me wildin', pop, pop, pop stylin'
Plain jane no diamonds, all prayers to the timing

Wave got a little boat
