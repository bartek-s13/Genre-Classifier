I got to know that your heart beats fast and
I got to know I'm the only one for you
What have I become?
I'm a fucking monster
When all I wanted was something beautiful

My love too much
Your love not enough
My love too much
Your love...

Oh, what it takes out of me to lay by your side
Oh, how it aches and it aches
You make me wanna die
I gotta kill you, my love
I gotta kill you, my love
Oh, what it takes out of me to lay by your side

You said forever
Now you look right through me
You said forever
Did your words fall short like you
What have I done?
I'm a fucking monster
When all I wanted was something beautiful

My love too much
Your love not enough
My love too much
Your love...

Oh, what it takes out of me to lay by your side
Oh, how it aches and it aches
You make me wanna die
I gotta kill you, my love
I gotta kill you, my love
Oh, what it takes out of me to lay by your side

My love too much
Your love not enough
My love too much
