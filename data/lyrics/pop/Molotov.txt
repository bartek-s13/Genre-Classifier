I take a whiskey neat
Chase away the gin and juice
I just can't control my feet
When I get a little bit loose (Step aside)

 Oh yeah, step aside, boy
 Oh yeah

Rollin' through the front door
Six drinks in
Point me at the dance floor
Throw me in
M—m—m—m—molotov
I'ma l—l—light it up
I'm a m—m—molotov
I'ma get this whole party all
Watch me now

 Oh yeah (Yeah)
 Oh yeah, I'm a m—m—molotov

I can't find a fuck to give
I'ma let this whole thing burn
Be useful now, hold my drink
Time for you to watch and learn (Hands off)

 Oh yeah, keep your hands off, boy
 Oh yeah

Rollin' through the front door
Six drinks in
Point me at the dance floor

 Oh yeah (Yeah)
Point me at the dance floor
Throw me in
I'm a m—m—molotov
I'ma get this whole party all

And I don't gotta rush, no, I really won't miss a thing
'Cause the party don't start till they see me walkin' in
