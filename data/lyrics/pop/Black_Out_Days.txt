Stay-ay ay ay ya away-ay ya away-ay ya

Hide the sun
I will leave your face out of my mind
You should save your eyes
A thousand voices howling in my head

Speak in tongues
I don't even recognize your face
Mirror on the wall
Tell me all the ways to stay away

Away-ay ya
Away-ay ya
And stay away-ay ya
Away-ay ya
Away-ay ya

Dig a hole
Fireworks exploding in my hands
If I could paint the sky
Would all the stars then shine a bloody red?
Stay
Hey hey hey ah
Away hey ah
Away hey ah
And stay
Hey hey hey ah
Away hey ah
Away hey ah

And stay
Hey hey hey ah (I'm hearing voices all the time and they're not mine)
Away hey ah
Away hey ah (I'm hearing voices and they're haunting my mind)
And stay
Hey hey hey ah  (I'm hearing voices all the time and they're not mine)
Away hey ah
Away hey ah (I'm hearing voices and they're haunting my mind)

Black out days
I don't recognize you anymore
