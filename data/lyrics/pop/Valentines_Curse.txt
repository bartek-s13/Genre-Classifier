The taste of love is in your mouth
Or might that be the taste of blood?
Lay her down, in the arms that beg for her
Lay her down over my heart
Valentine, you curse me every year
A breath away from your heart
You’d like to think you’ll be loved one day
Lay her down, in the arms that beg for her
Lay her down over my heart
