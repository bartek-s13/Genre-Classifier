Happy pills kickin' in, I love to be livin' in sin
Start a fight, got my pride, touch me and I'm gonna bite

Movin' slow, Truman Show, stuck in an all-time low
I don't know where to go so don't tell me that I should know
Losin' friends, blew my chance, tired of following plans
I wanna dance but don't wanna hold no hands

So why you, why you trippin'
Take a photo from my good side
Why you, why you trippin'
Got me tired of the hood life
So why am I just waitin'
Give me money and a mansion
Doctor doctor, I been way too patient
