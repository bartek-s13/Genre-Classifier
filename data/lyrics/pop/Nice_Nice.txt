Nightclub Dwight can take a negative vibe and then infuse it with the positive youth
Nightclub Dwight can take a little white lie and confuse it with a meaningless truth
One night Dwight, he got a little bit toothy
Now they all call him the good doctor tooth
One night Dwight got all goofy on the roofies
Now they all call him the fiddler on the roof
It's never just the Haffenreffer
It's never just the Bartles &amp; Jaymes
The wine tastes like propane
Stains wash right out in the white rain
And if Landsdowne's like a lariat
Then the Nice, Nice is a noose
And the positive youth's shooting hoops
Slipping roofies in your jungle juice
When Nightclub Dwight starts to talk about us getting some rocks
He ain't talking about the ice cubes
When Nightclub Dwight starts to talk about getting some rocks
He ain't talking about the ice cubes
When Nightclub Dwight starts to talk about the ice
He ain't talkin about the frozen water
He's talkin 'bout the diamonds and where we can find them and who we can sell them to and stuff like that
Hey bright eyes, are your synapses dimed?
That's not just cork that's floating round in your wine
The drinks taste like Pantene
The Visine wipes clean all the bad dreams
If Landsdowne's like a lariat
Then the Nice, Nice is a noose
Yeah we don't go on dates, we go out in big groups
With the roofies in our jungle juice
Remember Jenny back from "I Like the Lights"?
She said "Well, I like you Dwight
But I don't like the pipe
And the things that you put in your pipe, like your life"
Now Jenny missed her ride and she's takin off her tights
In the back seat of some taxi
We went from upstairs at the Nice, Nice up to Franklin up by 15th
And Jenny got dressed as they circled the block
They did the secret knock and stuck their hands through the mail slot
And one, two, three, four
That's the way that Jenny scores
And it's never just the liquor alone
And now we're prayin that you'll pick up the phone
Return all these pages
Yeah this party's outrageous
Everyone left and now the crash is contageous
And the ravers, they rose up right in unison
Attacked the bathroom and ransacked all the medicine
Pills administered just like communion
This is the body and the blood and the love and the blacklights on your white tights
The clubs are just like caves, these club kids are just slaves and these afterbars are just like their graves
It's the end of the night and now Jenny's creepin back to the east end
Shot through with the sunlight
