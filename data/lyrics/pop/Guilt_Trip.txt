I leave it on a bad note
Starting another screaming match
Bring all of our issues back to life
Going down a bad road
When you got somewhere else to be
I will take you down with me
'Cause I'm..
Always imagining the worst
When you're out drinking with the guys
I picture girls and girls and girls surrounding you
And they'd be stupid enough to fall
'Cause you're too easy on the eye
So when you're walking out the door
I start with you

I make you leave on a bad note
That way you'll be right back where you belong
Yeah, if you leave on a bad note
I know that your conscience won't leave you alone

Guilt trip you all the way home
Guilt trip you all the way home
Guilt trip you back in my arms
Guilt trip you all the way home
I know when you get there
You'll get a drink and check your phone
Tell your friends there's nothing wrong, but I
I know you'll be second guessing every word you said
And if the couch will be your bed tonight

I make you leave on a bad note
That way you'll be right back where you belong
Yeah, if you leave on a bad note
I know that your conscience won't leave you alone

Guilt trip you all the way home
Guilt trip you all the way home
Guilt trip you back in my arms
Guilt trip you all the way home
Guilt trip you all the way home (I'll get you right back)
Guilt trip you all the way home
Guilt trip you back in my arms (I'll get you right back)
Guilt trip you all the way home

I make you leave on a bad note
Yeah, if you leave on a bad note
I know that your conscience won't leave you alone
Guilt trip you all the way home (I'll get you right back)
Guilt trip you all the way home
Guilt trip you back in my arms (I'll get you right back)
Guilt trip you all the way home
Guilt trip you all the way home, mm-m
