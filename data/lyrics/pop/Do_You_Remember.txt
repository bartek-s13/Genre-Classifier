When did we lose our way?
Easier to let it go, oh
So many can't tell anybody
Harder to let you know

Call me when you made up your mind, but you won't
Caught up in the way that you played my heart
Only love could ever hit this hard

Oh don't be scared about it
Don't forget it was real
Do you remember the way it made you feel
Do you remember the things it let you feel?

How do I make you stay
When it's easier to let you go, oh
Nobody knows what we know about it
No one needs to know
(Call me, C-Call me)

Call me when you made up your mind, but you won't
Caught up in the way that you played my heart
Only love could ever hit this hard

Oh don't be scared about it
Don't forget it was real
Do you remember the way it made you feel
Do you remember the things it let you feel?

When you love to your limit
You gave all you're given
Who you're gonna pray to when you're there
When you find out that there ain't no other love, no other love for you, oh

Oh don't be scared about it
Don't forget it was real
Do you remember the way it made you feel
Do you remember the things it let you feel?
(Do you remember)

Oh, when you think about it
Do you remember me, oh
Do you remember the way it made you feel
