There's no need to be lonely (lonely, lonely)
I know where you belong, yeah, follow me
You only have to find me (find me, find me)
No matter who you are or what you see

You're a bird in a cage, cursing the day
Insulting the morning
But don't be afraid, we're coming your way
Wait for the calling

Come with us
If you give us all your money
We'll give you your dreams
It’s all soft focus
You'll never want to turn away
Once you release control
You'll be lost in a fantasy 'til your soul is lost
You'll be longing to run, longing to come with us

Find out what you can be (can be, can be)
And know that you'll surrender, fate unknown
Welcome to the family (family, family)
Open up the door, make yourself at home
Sign away your life to us
And then throw yourself to the falling
You don't need to be afraid
C'mon, this is the calling

Come with us
In a hazy frame of mind you believe this stuff
It’s all soft focus
You'll never want to turn away
Under electric stars
You'll be living your fantasy
And from dawn to dusk
You'll be longing to run, longing to come with us

Come away with me
Come away with me
C'mon, come with us
In a hazy frame of mind you believe this stuff
It’s all soft focus
And you'll never want to turn away
Under electric stars
You'll be lost in a fantasy 'til your soul is lost
You'll be longing to run, longing to come with us
