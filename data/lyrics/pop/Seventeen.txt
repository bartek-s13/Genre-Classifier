<<<<<<< HEAD
I say, here stand I
I can't do otherwise
But is it enough?
And why'd you look so tough?
Back at Patrick Park
We stood in the dark
In my beer-stained mind
I said "please won't you be mine?"

There's something dark hangin' over my head
I'm seventeen, don't hold your breath
There's something dark hangin' over my head
I'm seventeen, don't hold your breath

On the high school lot
You'd kiss me so long
But lessons don't last
When I'm playing you so fast

There's something dark hangin' over my head
I'm seventeen, don't hold your breath
There's something dark hangin' over my head
I'm seventeen, don't hold your breath

Punch and first collapse
Drunk at winter dance
Looks in red dress
Oh, what an awful mess

There's something dark hangin' over my head
I'm seventeen, don't hold your breath
There's something dark hangin' over my head
