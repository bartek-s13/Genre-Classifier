I was 19 and you were 23 and
We stayed in Number 4 Ferdinand Street
We spent five talking 'bout our lives
But we'd talked like that about a thousand times
And I'm bored of all that

You used to tell me that
Love is a lottery
And you got your numbers
And you're betting on me
You used to say that
Love is a game
But you got your numbers
And you're betting on me

I'll tell you about a guy
That I've been with
You ask "How old is he?"
And I laugh, "26"
"Nah, but he’s 30
How messed up is that?"
"Oh, forget it" he says
"I'm a jealous man
And I don't want to talk about that"

You used to tell me that
Love is a lottery
But you got your numbers
And you're betting on me
You used to say that
Love is a game
But you got your numbers
And you're betting on me
Are you still betting on me?

Hold on, my dear
Hold on real tight
It's just a numbers game
In my mind
And we've been here a thousand times
A thousand times
A thousand–

You used to tell me that
Love is a lottery
But you got your numbers
And you're betting on me
You used to say that
Love is a game
But you got your numbers
And you'll play it anyway

You used to tell me that
Love is a lottery
But you got your numbers
And you're betting on me
You used to tell me that
Love is a lottery
But you got your numbers
And you're betting on me
Are you still betting on me?
