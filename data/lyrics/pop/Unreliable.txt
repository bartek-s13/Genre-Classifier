Do you ever get unreliable?

Shining like a Tiffany, do you ever think of me?
Or do you get unreliable?
Unreliable, unreliable

Too much of one thing can make a man wiser, ooh

It's so confusing when you do this shit to me
I pay, I pay, I pay, I pay to play for keeps
Comes with the prize and a burden
When love goes as deep as you are, as deep as you are, yeah

You sure know how to make a man psyched now
Riding me like a bicycle from side to side now, yeah
