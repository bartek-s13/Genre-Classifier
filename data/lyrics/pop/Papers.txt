City scrapers
Up so high like ravers
Windows down low
Backseat sessions, come close
To me, skin deep
Chills so cold, it's icy
So let's roll papers
Love it when we drink too much
Forget to pay restaurants
Wish I known to take it off
I'm passing out
I love it when you break my neck
'Cause you're looking so damn perfect
But we don't gotta figure it out
But we'll be fine
You make, you make me so high
You make, you make me so high
You make, you make me so high
You make, you make me so high
You make, you make me so high
You make, you make me so high-high-high-high
You make, you make me so
You make, you make me so high
Sunrise vapors
Up so high, cloud chasers
Ripped jeans down low
Red lipstick on your nose
Kiss me, brain freeze
Chills so cold, it's icy
So let's roll papers
I love it when we drink too much
Forget to pay restaurants
Wish I known to take it off
I'm passing out
I love it when you break my neck
'Cause you're looking so damn perfect
But we don't gotta figure it out
But we'll be fine
You make, you make me so high
You make, you make me so high
You make, you make me so high
You make, you make me so high-high-high-high
You make, you make me so
(You make, you make me so high)
Inhale my XO's and then
Exhale a halo, yeah
You make my mind blow
Baby, you keep making my mind blow
Inhale my XO's and then
Exhale a halo, 'cause
You make, you make me so high-high-high-high
You make, you make me so
You make, you make me so high
You make, you make me so
