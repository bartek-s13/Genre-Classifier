She's a psycho from a Midwest suburb
No straightjacket could hold her
Wild eyes, they would lure me in her trap
I go mad just to hold her

Until I noticed that something was strange
Out of my range, there was no way back
Something went off in my brain
She was insane, here she goes again
A psycho from a Midwest suburb
I woke up and I told her

You won't know me when the feelings are all gone
And I tell everyone
And the look on your face will slowly come undone
'Cause it was all a front
And quietly, I say it to your face
That you will need to find another place to stay
And no you won't know me when the feelings are all gone
And I tell everyone, ay

She's a loose cannon with a temper, so absurd
Hiding from the police, yeah
Took pills with the name I'd never heard
But they were for sleep, she fooled me

That's when I noticed that something was strange
Out of my range, there was no way back
Something went off in my brain
She was insane, here she goes again
