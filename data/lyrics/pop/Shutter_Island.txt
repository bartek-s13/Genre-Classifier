<<<<<<< HEAD
The goodbyes are getting old
Next time, you can go ahead and go
I'm tired of begging you to love me
(Arguments and fighting and shit)

Goodness gracious, you're amazing
According to you, I'm a lucky lady (Wait)
So why'd you lie to me? (Huh?)
Why do I cry to sleep? (Huh?)
Goodness gracious, I'm replaceable (Yeah)
You say that I'm too crazy (Yeah)
I guess you were right (Yeah)
I guess you were right

My straitjacket's custom-made though
(With fucking diamonds)
My straitjacket's custom-made though
(With fucking rubies)
Yeah, I'm crazy just like Galileo
My straitjacket's custom-made though
(With diamonds)

You keep hitting, I've been bruised
Holyfield, I can't hear you (Hmm-hmm)
I'm tired of begging you to love me
You're expecting me to say
Loco, please, please stay
I'm tired of begging you to love me
(Arguments, of course you'd stay)

Goodness gracious, you're amazing
According to you, I'm a lucky lady
So why do I cry to sleep? (Why?)
Why'd you lie to me? (Why?)
Goodness gracious, I'm replaceable (Yeah)
You say that I'm too crazy
I guess you were right (Crazy)
I guess you were right

My straitjacket's custom-made though
(With fucking diamonds)
My straitjacket's custom-made though
(With fucking rubies)
Yeah, I'm crazy just like Galileo
My straitjacket's custom-made though
(With diamonds)

For a second I forgot I was a bad bitch
Begging you to stay became a habit
I'm tired of begging you to love me
I know I can be better, needed practice
I know I can be better, but the fact is
I'm tired of begging you to love me

Goodness gracious, let's just break up
I tried everything to save us
So why do I cry to sleep (Huh?)
Every time you try to leave? (Huh?)
Goodness gracious, this relationship
Is full of so much hatred
I guess you were right
