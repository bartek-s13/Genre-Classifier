I can hear her heart beat from a thousand miles
When the heaven's open I can see her smile
And when I come to her that's where I belong
Yet I run into her like a river's song

She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love

She's got a fine sense of humour when I'm feeling low down
And when I come to her when the sun goes down
She takes away my troubles, takes away my grief
Takes away my heartache in the night like a thief

She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love

Yes I need her in the daytime
Yes I need her in the night
Yes I want to throw my arms around her
And hug her, hug and kiss her tight

And when I'm returning from so far away
She gives me some sweet lovin' brightens up my day
And though it makes me mellow, yes it makes me whole
Yet it makes me right down in my soul

She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
