Yeah!

This television has a poison on its breath
This counterculture of both wicked lives and death
It makes my eyes bleed every time I turn around
How will they all feel when I bring them to the ground?
And I said…

"I walk for miles inside this pit of danger
A place where no one follows me
I walk alone."

I'm sick of all these people talkin' out their heads
I never understood a damn thing that they said
From words to actions, never knowin' what they're 'bout
I guess I'll have to chew them up and spit them out
And I said…

"I walk for miles inside this pit of danger
I've swallowed down a thousand years of anger
The weight of the world is fallin' on my shoulders
A place where no one follows me
I walk alone."
Yeah!
I walk alone!
Oh yeah!
Yeah!

I walk for miles inside this pit of danger
I've swallowed down a thousand years of anger
The weight of the world is falling' on my shoulders
A place where no one follows me
I walk alone

I walk alone
Yeah!
