I've been overdrinkin', I wonder what you do
Tell me what you're thinkin', what's your point of view?
Do you remember in December? Never on our own
Better yet together, we were walking through the snow

I've been reminiscing, baby
I'm missin' what we could be
Will he know the things you like
Will he touch your body like me?

I just wanna know if I should keep your number
I just wanna know if I should keep your number
I just wanna know if I should-
Na, na, na, na-na, na, na

Don't like the situation, the way you act so cool
Can't you just admit it, that you're hurting too?
I just wanna lay with your body again
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Try to stay connected, but you don't pick up the phone

So I just wanna know if I should keep your number
I just wanna know if I should keep your number
I just wanna know if I should-
I've been reminiscing, baby
I'm missin' what we could be
Will he know the things you like
Will he touch your body like me?
If this is what you want for us
Now find a way to get through
But there ain't nobody better
Ain't nobody better, better than you

Yeah, I just wanna know if I should-
(I just wanna know, I just wanna know, babe)
I just wanna know if I should keep your number
(I just wanna know, I just wanna know, babe)
I just wanna know, I just wanna know
I just wanna know if I should keep it
I just wanna know
I just wanna know if I should-
