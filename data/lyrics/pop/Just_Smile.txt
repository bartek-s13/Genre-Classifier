Sometimes I just sit down on a bench and start to
Watch all the people walking by
I see all the different kind of faces
People all around the place are wondering why-I-I

Just smile, just smile
Just smile, just smile
Just smile, just smile
Just smile, why-I-I just smile
Why-I-I just smile, just smile
Just smile, just smile

These days I can see the world is changing
I hear everyone complaining all the time
Hold on you're always in a hurry
But you don't need to worry, why don't you

Just smile, just smile
Just smile, just smile
Just smile, just smile
Just smile, why don't you just smile
Why don't you just smile, just smile
Just smile, just smile
Sometimes I sit down on a bench
To enjoy the moment
Just for a moment
Why-I-I just smile

Just smile, just smile
Just smile, just smile
Why-I-I just smile, just smile
Just smile, just smile
Just smile, just smile
Just smile, just smile
Why-I-I just smile, just smile
Just smile, just smile
Why-I-I just smile, Just smile
