I wanna hand you my heart and let you carry the load
Nobody tells you anything you need to know
I need a friend but a friend is so hard to find
I need an answer but I'm always one step behind

Cause it takes time
Learning to fly

Do you ever feel like all you want is to go home
To kiss the earth, to weave a way through this storm
Some days I rage like a fire in the wilderness
Some days I only need the darkness and a place to rest

Oh it takes time
(It takes time)
Learning to fly

Tear up this town
Blinking in the sunlight as the walls come down
This fire will burn
Digging for a truth that just can't be found
Don't want your lessons in love
I want to tear it all up
I need a friend but a friend is so hard to find
I need an answer but I'm always one step behind
Oh it takes time
(It takes time)
Yes, it takes time
(It takes time)
Learning to fly

Tear up this town
Blinking in the sunlight as the walls come down
This fire will burn
Digging for a truth that just can't be found
Don't want your lessons in love
