Hangin'
By the heart like that
Play the part like that
Play it, play it
Hangin'
By the heart like that
Play the part like that
Play it, play it

High sometimes
Thinking
Just thinking about you
And I get by sometimes
The same way
As I'm sure you do

Next thing I see
You were getting up to leave
Everything I feel
In a rush
Watch it disappear
Oh, I can hear it
I can't get no rest

You had me hangin' by the heartstrings
Can you hear the violins coming? (I can hear it)
You had me hangin' by the heartstrings
Playing to the sound of my heart
Hangin' on a symphony (hangin' by the heart like that)
I don't need no sympathy (play the part like that)
Every time I hear the beat (play it, play it, yeah, yeah)
It's where I wanna be
Hangin' by the heartstrings
Playing to the sound of my heart

Pull me in by a single thread
Then wind me up
Wind me up 'til there's nothing less
Oh, it's nights like these
Nights I can't forget

Next thing I see
You were getting up to leave
Everything I feel in a rush
Watch you disappear
Oh, I can hear it
I can't get no rest

You had me hangin' by the heartstrings
Can you hear the violins coming? (I can hear it)
You had me hangin' by the heartstrings
Playing to the sound of my heart
Hangin' on a symphony (hangin' by the heart like that)
I don't need no sympathy (play the part like that)
Every time I hear the beat (play it, play it, yeah, yeah)
It's where I wanna be
Hangin' by the heartstrings
Playing to the sound of my heart

So we're hangin' on
'Cause the feeling's strong
We're hangin' on
'Til the feeling's gone
So we're hangin' on
The feeling's strong
We're hangin' on

You had me hangin' by the heartstrings
Can you hear the violins coming? (I can hear it)
You had me hangin' by the heartstrings
Playing to the sound of my heart
Hangin' on a symphony (hangin' by the heart like that)
I don’t need no sympathy (play the part like that)
Every time I hear the beat (play it, play it, yeah, yeah)
It's where I wanna be
Hangin' by the heartstrings
