Tell you where he's goin'
Where I'll be, where I'll move to Ohio
But why's it so hard to believe?

So I purchase by stole
Passing glance, know the chances in Ohio
But why's it so hard to believe?

I don't know
I'll try to dodge it babe but by the way, oh
I don't know
I'll try and find my way down to east LA
No, I do not know
How I will dodge it babe but I've got to say that
Ohio, it's calling my name, calling my name

Tell you where he's goin'
Where I'll be, where I'll move to Ohio
'Cause why is it so hard to believe?
