Can we take a break from this life?
Set our worries to the side
Live a day like it's ours
Share an evening with the stars

Let's eat, honey, pick me up
Smile at you, I'll never stop
Wanna be doin' that couple stuff
I'm tired of being lonely

I just wanna see
I just wanna see your face now
Just wanna see
I just wanna see your face now
Just wanna see
I just wanna see your face now
Just wanna see

I should remember when it's hard
It's only 'cause we've been apart
Terrified by the space
So when I get you in my place

Let's just eat then, honey, pick me up
Smile at you until we drop
Wanna be doin' that couple stuff
I'm tired of being lonely

I just wanna see
I just wanna see your face now
Just wanna see
I just wanna see your face now
Just wanna see
I just wanna see your face now
Just wanna see
I just wanna see your face

You standing there
And I watching you, darling, you better
Get over here
Close your eyes and let your mind run free

'Cause I just wanna see
Just wanna see your face now
Just wanna see
I just wanna see your face now
Just wanna see
I'm tired of being lonely
I just wanna see
I just wanna see your face now
Just wanna see
I just wanna see your face now
Just wanna see
I just wanna see your face now
Just wanna see
I just wanna see your face now

Wanna
Wanna
See your
Face, face, face
