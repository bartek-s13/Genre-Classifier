I feel like this is a bad one
Racked up too many mistakes
Thought you were in for the long run
Now you're just another heartbreak

Ooh, you don't know how this goes
If I'm being honest, yeah

It might take a little longer for us to be cool again
It might take a little longer for us to be cool again
I know I said that we'll be fine, but that was then, I guess I lied
It might take a little longer for us to be cool, cool, again
Cool, cool again

Had my heart for over three years
Don't think you understand
Probably take double that to see clear
Keeping up ain't part of my plan

Ooh, you don't know how this goes
If I'm being honest, yeah

It might take a little longer for us to be cool again
It might take a little longer for us to be cool again
I know I said that we'll be fine, but that was then, I guess I lied
It might take a little longer for us to be cool, cool, again
Cool, cool again

We had sketched out our future
You were mine and I was yours
You'll always have a place in my heart
Just need some time to heal

It might take a little longer for us to be cool again
It might take a little longer for us to be cool again
I know I said that we'll be fine, but that was then, I guess I lied
It might take a little longer for us to be cool, cool, again
Cool, cool again

Cool again, baby
Cool again
