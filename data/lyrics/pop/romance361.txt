Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Every time we fuck, got me thinking that you down
When I sober up, it's like you don't come around
All I speak is truth and I told ya
If you playin' with me, I'ma show ya
See me goin' up, now she wanna come around
She gon' slow me down, so I left her back in town
I ain't fuckin' with you, on my mama
Every time I do it's full of drama

You don't like to do what I say
I don't like the way that you play
So I'm doin' me, you doing you, I can't lose focus
Smokin' way too much, I think it got me feeling hopeless
Rebound off you then it's on to your friends
You the reason why I'm doggin', how can I pretend
One step back just to see the real you
Love nowadays, swear on me it'll kill ya
Come on, hop in my whip (Skrrt)
We gon' take a trip to a place that you've never seen before
Take this here, get yo fix
All you need is one rip and you go
Now you can go
It's 361, if they don't feel you they gon' put you on a t-shirt
Ballin', I've been ballin'
You would think a nigga's knees hurt
Ain't nobody stoppin' my shine, you are so fine
A damn waste of my time
Every time we fuck, got me thinking that you down
When I sober up, it's like you don't come around
All I speak is truth and I told ya
If you playin' with me, I'ma show ya
See me goin' up, now she wanna come around ('Round)
