Maybe I, maybe I
Am just as scared as you
It's alright
Stay by my side
On the edge, on the edge
Of everything we know
It's alright
Just don't look down

And I will hold on

And never let go
You're right beside me
So just close your eyes
I'll never let go
You're all that I need
So just close your eyes

When I look back, I look back
On the times you tried to hide
Inside your delicate mind
In the end, in the end
I'm just the same as you
And it's alright
Just stay by my side

And I will hold on

And never let go
You're right beside me
So just close your eyes
I'll never let go
You're all that I need
So just close your eyes

I would die for
I would die for this
So get in my heart
I would die for
I would die for this
So get in my heart
So just close your eyes
So just close your eyes
Just close your eyes

And never let go
You're right beside me
So just close your eyes
I'll never let go
You're all that I need
