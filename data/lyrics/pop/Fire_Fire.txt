<<<<<<< HEAD
Almost thought we'd made it home
But we don't know this place at all
That's enough now dry your tears
It's been a long eleven years

Fire
Fire Fire
Fire from the tongues of liars

You're ashamed of where you're from
(you're ashamed of where you're from)
Crying cause your father's drunk
We can't die because we're young
At least that's what we heard in a song
(Chorus x2)
(Bridge)
You're ashamed at what you've done
Crying cause your father's wrong
Trying to be something new
You'll feel that you had something to prove
What you confuse for glory's fire
Is fire from the tongues of liars
What you confuse for glory's fire
Is fire from the tongues of liars
Oh send your rain
(Chorus x4)
(Verse 3)
You're afraid of who you are
(You're afraid of where you're from)
Crying cause your father's gone
(Fire from the tongues of liars)
Dreaming till you hit the truth
(We can't die because we're young)
You'll find that you've nothing to lose
(Fire from the tongues of liars)
