See, up the sky
There, we'll be so high
Feel, the sun in your eyes
Yes, all is so bright
Oh I'm flying towards the sun
I am dying, right into the light
Be, a butterfly
Dare, we can defy
Free, we'll touch the sky
Yes, all is so bright
Oh I'm flying towards the sun
I am dying, right into the light
Oh I'm flying towards the sun
All is so bright
I am dying, right into the light
All is so bright
Towards the sun
All is so bright
Into the light
All is so bright
Bright
All is so bright
