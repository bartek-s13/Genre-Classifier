Oh, Hannah
I wanna feel you close
Oh, Hannah
Come lie with my bones
Oh, Hannah
Don't look away
Oh, Hannah
Just look at me the same

I don't wanna be your friend, I wanna kiss your lips (Ooh)
I wanna kiss you until I lose my breath
I don't wanna be your friend, I wanna kiss your lips (Ooh)
I wanna kiss you until I lose my breath
Oh, Hannah, oh, Hannah, oh, Hannah, oh, Hannah

Oh, Hannah
Tell me something nice
Like flowers and blue skies
Oh, Hannah
I will follow you home
Although my lips are blue and I'm cold

I don't wanna be your friend, I wanna kiss your lips
(Ooh)
I wanna kiss you until I lose my breath (Ooh)
I don't wanna be your friend, I wanna kiss your lips (Ooh)
I wanna kiss you until I lose my breath
Oh, Hannah, oh, Hannah, oh, Hannah, oh, Hannah
I wanna kiss you until I lose my breath
I don't wanna be your friend

I don't wanna be your friend, I wanna be your bitch
And I wanna touch you but not like this
The look in your eyes
My hand between your thighs
Oh, this can't be real
It's all just a dream

I don't wanna be your friend, I wanna kiss your lips (Ooh)
I wanna kiss you until I lose my breath (Ooh)
I don't wanna be your friend
Lose my breath (Ooh)
I don't wanna be your friend
