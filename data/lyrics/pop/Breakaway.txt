I apologize, my emotions are hidin’
Hard to explain when you feel your world's on fire
Close my eyes to all the things that hurt my nature
I apologize, but I am
Apologize, but I am
Apologize, but I am

I'm tired of holdin' my head up
I'm tired of tryin' to hold onto you
This cycle, fighting and making up
I'm tired of tryin' to hold on

Everything is fallin' apart, slippin' away
There's no rewindin' the things we say
Everything is fallin' apart, slippin' away
No way to fight it

I'll break, breakaway
Break, breakaway
I'll break, breakaway
Break, breakaway
I'll break

The ground and the ceilin' seem to be disappearing
Nothin' to stand on, oh God, I hate this feelin'
You put the weight of your world down on my shoulders
Why'd you have to make me older?
Make me older, make me older

I'm tired of holdin' my head up
I'm tired of tryin' to hold onto you
This cycle, fighting and making up
I'm tired of tryin' to hold on

Everything is fallin' apart, slippin' away
There's no rewindin' the things we say
Everything is fallin' apart, slippin' away
No way to fight it

I'll break, breakaway
Break, breakaway
I'll break, breakaway
Break, breakaway


Everything is fallin' apart, slippin' away
There's no rewindin' the things we say
Everything is fallin' apart, slippin' away
No way to fight it

I'll break, breakaway
Break, breakaway
I'll break, breakaway
