Oh, here we go again, on this ride
Incapable of just being friends
Always on my mind
Waiting for something
A message late at night
Are you gonna say what you wanna say?
Are we gonna do this right?

But I'm hesitating when I'm around you
I can't escape that look in your eyes
It's getting late and we're just talkin'
My feels locked inside
I wanna know, wanna go to the deep end
Tired of all this actin' shy
I wanna know, wanna go to the deep end

'Cause you're the one that I want
'Cause you're the one that I need
I just wanna fall in your arms
So I知 begging down here on my knees
On my knees

Oh, here we go again
Am I crossing a line?
Say something, you're saying nothing
Talking all the time
Am I something special, something more?
Or just another boy in line?
Are we gonna do this right?

But I'm hesitating when I'm around you
I can't escape that look in your eyes
It's getting late and we're just talkin'
My feels locked inside
I wanna know, wanna go to the deep end
Tired of all this actin' shy
I wanna know, wanna go to the deep end

'Cause you're the one that I want
'Cause you're the one that I need
I just wanna fall in your arms
So I知 begging down here on my knees
On my knees

I'm hesitating when I'm around you
I can't escape that look in your eyes
I wanna know, wanna go to the deep end
'Cause you're the one that I want
'Cause you're the one that I need
That I need

'Cause you're the one that I want
'Cause you're the one that I need
I just wanna fall in your arms
So I知 begging down here on my knees
On my knees

'Cause you're the one that I want
'Cause you're the one that I need
I just wanna fall in your arms
So I知 begging down here on my knees
On my knees
But I'm hesitating when I'm around you
I can't escape that look in your eyes
I wanna know, wanna go to the deep end
'Cause you're the one that I want
'Cause you're the one that I need
That I need
