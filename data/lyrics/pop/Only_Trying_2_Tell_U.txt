Hands are shaking; don't know why you won't let me
Come a little closer to you
I'm terrified of the lies I've let swim into my head
Sometimes at night I talk to you even though you're not there
So I whisper to the ground
I'm only trying to tell you something babe
Eyes are tearing up, I don't know why I'm so scared
Something about your beauty terrifies me
Now I'm trembling in this empty bed
Trying to realise that all of you is gone now
So I whisper to the dark, I'm only trying to tell you something baby
So I whisper to the dark, I'm only trying to tell you something

I'm only trying to tell you something

Only trying to tell you
Only trying to tell you
Only trying to tell you, something babe
Baby something
