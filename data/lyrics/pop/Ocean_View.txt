I know those eyes, I know that smile, yeah

Oh, baby, I'm fallin', fallin', fallin' again
Now, I only have one thing to ask

Yeah, I wanna know
Do you remember me?
Girl, I want you to
'Cause I remember missin' you
We used to fuck for hours with an ocean view
Now, I wonder why you act like a fool

'Cause you used to want it bad
Scratch marks on my back from
You, you, you, you, yeah
You, you, you, you
Yeah, I know your freaky sides
All the things you like
You, you, you, you, yeah
