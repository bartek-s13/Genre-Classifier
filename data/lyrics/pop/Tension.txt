You're acting shy
Coming with that same look in your eye
Do we gotta do this every time?
You're telling me more than you realise, realise
Uncomfortable
Why you kinda play like you don't know?
Do I gotta make this literal?
I'll spell it out, you read it so slow, so slow

Is something on your mind?
Where there's smoke, there's fire

I can feel this tension
Can you feel it too?
I can feel this tension
Between me and you
Give in to this tension
Oooh
Tension

I like this feel
That moment just before the big reveal
Before we talk about it, make it real
Let's ride these butterflies and just chill, just chill

Is something on your mind?
Where there's smoke, there's fire

I can feel this tension
Can you feel it too?
I can feel this tension
Between me and you
Give in to this tension
Oooh
Tension
Give in to this tension
Oooh
Tension

I know I can read your mind
But they say where there's smoke, there's fire
So baby while we still got time
Put your sweaty palms in mine
Put your sweaty palms in mine

I can feel this tension
Can you feel it too?
I can feel this tension
Between me and you
Give in to this tension
Oooh
Tension
Give in to this tension
Oooh
Tension
Give in to this
