One, two, three

For every time that I told you, "Go away" yea
You showed me patience, you always waited for me
Times I lied here like I'm wasted
Call you to save me, you never think I'm crazy
Need to take a moment and thank god what I got
I got a man who's gonna love me even when I cannot
Made me do a full 180
'Cause you're my baby, it's in the way you hold me

(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'll try, try to be better for you
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Just a little better now

But make me a promise
That I can be myself, not someone else
If I'm honest
Feel like the only girl in this lonely world
But a part of me
Is right by your side and that makes it alright
Baby, hold on to me
Baby, hold on to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah

I wondered why you're bothering with my shit
When no one else did
Can't wrap my head around it
Weigh too heavy on my conscience
You make me softer
Every time you love me harder

(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'll try, try to be better for you
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Just a little better now

But make me a promise
That I can be myself, not someone else
If I'm honest
Feel like the only girl in this lonely world
But a part of me
Is right by your side and that makes it alright
Baby, hold on to me
Baby, hold on to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah

I got a one-way ticket, I ain't going nowhere (Nowhere)
Nowhere, oh, no way
I got a one-way ticket, I ain't going nowhere
Nowhere

Make me a promise
That I can be myself, not someone else
If I'm honest
Feel like the only girl in a fucked up world
But a part of me
Is right by your side and that makes it alright
So baby, hold on to me
Baby, hold on to me
Yeah, yeah (Yeah), yeah, yeah yeah
(No, no)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah

I got a one-way ticket, I ain't going nowhere (Got a one-way)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah)
Nowhere (Nowhere)
I got a one-way ticket, I ain't going nowhere
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah)
Nowhere
