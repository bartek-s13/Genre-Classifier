Thought that we were perfect suited
I wish I could murder Cupid
'Cause we were kissin' in the crowds, paraded you around
Told everyone I found the one
How could I be oh, so, stupid?

I wanna scream out, I wanna scream out loud
I'm such a loser
I got my head up, my head up in the clouds

Why did I give you that P.D.A.?
Why did you tell me you feel that way?
If you were only gonna change your mind and waste my time
I'll take it back again
I gave you my P.D.A.
And now I wish I never did

Now I wish I never did (I wish I never did)

Now I wish I never let you meet my parents
'Cause now I gotta call and tell 'em
(I know, I know, I know, I know, I know)
I know I got a little carried away, and all they're gonna say is
"You'll be okay, never liked her anyway"
But when you gonna learn your lesson?

I wanna scream out, I wanna scream out loud
I'm such a loser
I got my head up, my head up in the clouds

Why did I give you that P.D.A.?
Why did you tell me you feel that way?
If you were only gonna change your mind and waste my time
I'll take it back again
I gave you my P.D.A.
And now I wish I never did

Regret that on that night I kissed you
But now I wish I never did
Secrets, I told you my deepest
But now I wish I never did
I gave you every part of me
But now I wish I never did
Now I wish I never did (Never)

Why did I give you that P.D.A.?
Why did you have to look at me that way?

Why did I give you that P.D.A.?
Why did you tell me you feel that way? (That way)
If you were only gonna change your mind and waste my time
I'll take it back again
I gave you my P.D.A. (A, A, A)
And now I wish I never did

Now I wish I never did (Why, why, why, why)
(Why, don't wanna give you my...)
Now I wish I never did
