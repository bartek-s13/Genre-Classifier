I am on the very first week away from you
Not a lot to say or do
I see you in the places where I once held your skin
There's nowhere I can go where we haven't been

In the middle of a heartbreak song that I'm writin' for you
I find words to escape with all the courage I grew
But I feel you pullin' and my spirit breaks again
I'll be whole but I don't know when

I'll be whole, I'll be whole but I don't know when
I'll be whole, I'll be whole but I don't know when

It's easy to compress our time into only good
And lookin' back it's easy to think that nothin' ever really went wrong
And I remember heartache and it helps me understand
Trying to find comfort anyway I can

In the middle of a heartbreak song that I'm writin' for you
I find words to escape with all the courage I grew
But I feel you pullin' and my spirit breaks again
I'll be whole but I don't know when
I'll be whole, I'll be whole but I don't know when
I'll be whole, I'll be whole but I don't know when

And as I lie here in pieces
Breakin' was just what I needed
I knew we had to end
I'll be whole, I'll be whole but I don't know when
The more that I think about it
I was better off without it
But now I have to mend
I'll be whole, I'll be whole but I don't know when

Oh, oh, oh
I'll be whole, I'll be whole but I don't know when
Oh, oh, oh
I'll be whole, I'll be whole but I don't know when

In the middle of a heartbreak song that I'm writin' for you
I find words to escape with all the courage I grew
But I feel you pullin' and my spirit breaks again
I'll be whole but I don't know when
But I don't know when
