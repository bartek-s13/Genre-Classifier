<<<<<<< HEAD
Pearls and swine
Bereft of me
Long and weary
My road has been
I was lost in the cities
Alone in the hills
No sorrow or pity
For leaving, I feel, yeah

I am not your rolling wheels
I am the highway
I am not your carpet ride
I am the sky

Friends and liars
Don't wait for me
Cause I'll get on
All by myself
I put millions of miles
Under my heels
And still too close
To you, I feel, yeah
I am not your rolling wheels
I am the highway
I am not your carpet ride
I am the sky
I am not your blowing wind
I am the lightning
I am not your autumn moon
I am the night, the night

Yeah! I am not your rolling wheels
I am the highway
I am not your carpet ride
I am the sky
Well, I am not your blowing wind
I am the lightning
I am not your autumn moon
I am the night, the night
