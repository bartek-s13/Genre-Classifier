Whatcha been doing?
Whatcha been doing?
Whoa whoa, haven't seen ya around
How you been feeling?
How you been feeling?
Whoa whoa, don't you bring me down

All that stuff about me being with him
Can't believe all the lies that you told
Just to ease your own soul
But I'm bigger than that
No, you don't have my back
No, no - ha!

Hey, how long till the music drowns you out?
Don't put words up in my mouth
I didn't steal your boyfriend
Hey, how long till you face what's going on?
'Cause you really got it wrong
I didn't steal your boyfriend

Well, I'm sorry that he called me
And that I answered the telephone
Don't be worried, I'm not with him
And when I go out tonight, I'm going home alone
Just got back from my tour
I'm a mess, girl for sure
All I want is some fun
Guess that I'd better run
Hollywood sucks you in, but it won't spit me out
Whoa, whoa - ha!

Hey, how long till the music drowns you out?
Don't put words up in my mouth
I didn't steal your boyfriend
Hey, how long till you face what's going on?
'Cause you really got it wrong
I didn't steal your boyfriend

Hey, how long 'til you look at your own life
'Stead of looking into mine?
I didn't steal your boyfriend
Hey, how long 'til you're leaving me alone?
Don't you got somewhere to go?
I didn't steal your boyfriend

Whoa, whoa, whoa, ha!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, ha!
Please stop telling all your friends
I'm getting sick of them
Always staring at me like I took him from ya
