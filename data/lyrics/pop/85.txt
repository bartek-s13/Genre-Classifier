Put your cigarette out, know I hate those
I hate how you left a bad taste in my mouth
I believed what I wanted to see in you
In us two now the truth's coming out

There's a ghost in my bed
Should've known what to expect
But you, you could tell me I'm different
If it ends the same, what's the difference?
Lie to me, make it seem better than it ever was

Oh-oh, I should really use my head
I should really use my head 'stead of thinking with my chest, yeah
Oh-oh, I was dying to connect
Gave me 85%, only 85%, yeah

Woah-oh, yeah, yeah

We dive into things head first
Hoping for something more than we knew we could be
You didn't have any cruel intentions
I thought I mentioned I want more than you
There's a ghost in my bed
Guess it's nobody's fault in the end
You lied to me, you could tell me I'm different
If it ends the same, what's the difference?
Lie to me, make it seem better than it ever was

Oh-oh, I should really use my head
I should really use my head 'stead of thinking with my chest, yeah
Oh-oh, I was dying to connect
Gave me 85%, only 85%, yeah

There's a ghost in my bed
Should've known what to expect
Oh-oh, I was dying to connect
Gave me 85%, only 85%, yeah

It's a challenge
Tryna find the balance between love and lust
All we got was lost when I really thought we had it
Feelings fade and people change and things, they fall apart
But that doesn't mean I don't believe in speaking from the heart
You see, you're more like Coke, I'm more like Pepsi
I just hope you don't forget me
It wasn't right, the way you left me
Heartbreak Hotel always depressed me
Could you give me just a little bit more?
Should've known what I was asking for
We met as friends, we'll end as friends
We will be 'til we die, right?
But if you start to miss me, I don't like to be alone
So if you wanna try again, you better let me know
Oh-oh, I should really use my head
I should really use my head 'stead of thinking with my chest, yeah
Oh-oh, I was dying to connect
Gave me 85%, only 85%, yeah
