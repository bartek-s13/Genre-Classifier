Where's your heaven?
Can't touch your skin without leaving scars, scars
And your body rocks from side to side
You're still on my mind
And here's to nothing
Just the touch of your skin could be enough
But you're not here
Are you sleeping, are you sleeping at all?
Have we said it all?
Will you hunt me down?
Maybe you're a bad idea but I'm loving every minute of it
Will you hunt me down
Maybe you're a bad idea but I'm loving every minute of it
Maybe you're a bad idea but I'm loving every minute of it
What am I missing
Your concrete thoughts and your liquid sense of vision
Won't you stay awhile and paint me right on you
Won't you stay awhile and paint me something new
Have we said it all?
Will you hunt me down?
Maybe you're a bad idea but I'm loving every minute of it
Will you hunt me down
Maybe you're a bad idea but I'm loving every minute of it
Maybe you're a bad idea but I'm loving every minute of it
Oh did you get it right, take a little time
Did you fight, did you wait awhile
And did you get your freedom?
Whoa, did you get it right, take a little time
Did you fight, did you wait awhile
And did you get your freedom?
Oh did you get it right, take a little time
Did you fight, did you wait awhile
Did you get your freedom?
Oh did you get it right, take a little time
Did you fight, did you wait awhile
Did you get your freedom?
Maybe you're a bad idea but I'm loving every minute of it
Will you hunt me down?
Maybe you're a bad idea but I'm loving every minute of it
Will you hunt me down
Maybe you're a bad idea but I'm loving every minute of it
Maybe you're a bad idea but I'm loving every minute of it
