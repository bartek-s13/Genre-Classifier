Yeah yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah

Want to believe that I got nothing for you at all, at all
Yet the way you treat me
You treat me like the king that I am, the king that I am

I'll be in the corner drawing pictures of myself
Trying to be somebody else, making something for myself now
I'll be in the corner 'til you show me all my wealth
'Til you show me all my wealth, 'til you show me all my
Now I

Got something to love about you
I got something to love about you
Got something to love about you
I got something to love about you

Told myself, holding my images
Time to forget it, born again, and I
Wonder if I rise too slow, I'll fall asleep
Waiting on my own until you talk to me

I'll be in the corner drawing pictures of myself
Trying to be somebody else, making something for myself now
I'll be in the corner 'til you show me all my wealth
'Til you show me all my wealth, 'til you show me all my
Now I

Got something to love about you
I got something to love about you
Got something to love about you
I got something to love about you
Got something to love about you
I got something to love about you
Got something to love about you
