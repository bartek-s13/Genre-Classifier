So I've always had a hole to fill
In a heart that's never bullet proof
I wonder why she loves my dollar bills
But there's no value with doubt through the roof
Being alone feels right at home tonight
I am no cast away but I'll wash away all right
This freedom's like no other
And I'm seeing bright new colours
'Cause being alone feels right at home tonight
Feels right at home tonight
I really tried to focus on myself
But myself is not priority
And when I finally bid her fare thee well
It's the thought that swiftly comes to me
Being alone feels right at home tonight
I am no cast away but I'll wash away all right
This freedom's like no other
And I'm seeing bright new colours
'Cause being alone feels right at home tonight
I am no cast away but I'll wash away all right
This freedom's like no other
And I'm seeing bright new colours
'Cause being alone feels right at home tonight
'Cause being alone feels right at home tonight
'Cause being alone feels right at home
