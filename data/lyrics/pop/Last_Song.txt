<<<<<<< HEAD
Out of words
Never learned not to sing your name again
'Cause it hurts, never works
So you've brought me to the end

Now you look like a stranger
Why are you holding on to the past?

This is your last song
Threw it on the fire with the rest
This is the last time I let your melody in my head
I put my heart and my soul on the pages
But now they're fading
Last song, I hope you understand

You were trouble, always trouble
Everything you put me through
Couldn't see that side of you
Now you look like a stranger

Now you look like a stranger
Why are you holding on to the past?
This is your last song
Threw it on the fire with the rest
This is the last time I let your melody in my head
I put my heart and my soul on the pages
But now they're fading
Last song, I hope you understand

You didn't listen to my love songs
Didn't appreciate my words
I'll let you miss them now that I'm gone

This is your last song
Threw it on the fire with the rest
This is the last time I let your melody in my head
I put my heart and my soul on the pages
But now they're fading
Last song, I hope you understand
This is your last song
Threw it on the fire with the rest
This is the last time I let your melody in my head
I put my heart and my soul on the pages
But now they're fading
Last song, I hope you understand
This is your last, last song
