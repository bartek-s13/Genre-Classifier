Cool
Yeah, can you tell me that I'm cool?
I've always wanted to be cool
But I'm not that cool, that cool
I just wanna be cool (cool, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, can you tell me that I'm cool? (lalalala la la la, doo, doo)
I've always wanted to be cool (cool, yeah, yeah)
But I'm not that cool, that cool (that cool)

I'm feelin' pretty good (feelin' pretty good)
Life's not bad right now
I can't complain
So I think I might go to this party
That this girl invited me to (oh, oh)
And so I get dressed
I look at myself in the mirror
And I say, "Oh no"
Is that what I really look like?
I don't wanna be me
But that's only half of the time
'Cause inside I know I'm cool, so cool

I just wanna be cool
Yeah, can you tell me that I'm cool?
I've always wanted to be cool
But I'm not that cool, that cool
I just wanna be cool (cool, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, can you tell me that I'm cool? (lalalala la la la, doo, doo)
I've always wanted to be cool (cool, yeah, yeah)
