Fuck it, it's late, can we go back
Can we go back to your place?
I know I usually say, "I don't do this"
But we're lying anyway
Fuck it, we're here
And I'm slurring and I'm crying
'Cause I must've had one too many drinks

For everyone I've hurt, everyone I've hurt
Did you hear the sirens bell?
For everyone I've hurt, everyone I've hurt
Guess I'll see you down in hell

And I blinded you 'cause I loved your eyes
And I took your voice 'cause I love to lie
And I weighed you down, so I learned to fly
Last night I made you cry

Remember that time
That I told you I was all alone, I lied
I never do what's right
I said my phone was dead
But your sister tried to call me on her way
She never liked me much

For everyone I've hurt, everyone I've hurt
Did you hear the sirens bell?
For everyone I've hurt, everyone I've hurt
Guess I'll see you down in hell

And I blinded you 'cause I loved your eyes
And I took your voice 'cause I love to lie
And I weighed you down, so I learned to fly
Last night I made you cry

And I told you once and I told you twice (Mm)
That I let you go just to watch you fall
And I told you once and I told you twice (Mm, mm)

And I blinded you 'cause I loved your eyes
And I took your voice 'cause I love to lie
And I weighed you down, so I learned to fly
Last night I made you cry
And I blinded you 'cause I loved your eyes
And I took your voice 'cause I love to lie
And I weighed you down, so I learned to fly
