You always said that I'd come back to you again
'Cause everybody needs a friend, it's true
Someone to quiet the voices in my head
Make 'em sing to me instead, it's you

Hate to say that I love you
Hate to say that I need you
Hate to say that I want you
But I do

Bad habit, I know
But I'm needin' you right now
Can you help me out?
Can I lean on you?
Been one of those days
Sun don't wanna come out
Can you help me out?
Can I lean on you?

You make me feel like I'm floatin' off the ground
Above this little town, you do
Look at me smile with tears in my eyes
I love the way you lie, I do
Hate to say that I'm lonely
Hate to say that I miss you
Hate to say that it's dark in here
But it's true, oh

Bad habit, I know
But I'm needin' you right now
Can you help me out?
Can I lean on you?
Been one of those days
Sun don't wanna come out
Can you help me out?
Can I lean on you?

Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Can I lean on you?
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Can I lean on you?

Hate to say that I'm lonely
Hate to say that I miss you
Hate to say that it's dark in here
But it's true
Bad habit, I know
But I'm needin' you right now
Can you help me out?
Can I lean on you?
Oh, can I lean on you?
You
Can I lean on you?

Hate to say that I love you
Hate to say that I need you
Hate to say that I want you
But I do
