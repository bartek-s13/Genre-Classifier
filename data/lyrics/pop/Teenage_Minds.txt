I could take you to my favorite place
Might get drunk and sleep all day
You could borrow my old t-shirt
Like you used to do
I put some money on a thousand dollar car
Let's drive to the motel bar
You know the place when I first kissed you
Can't we just go back?

And none of our friends would believe us
'Cause we left it in the dark
And now I know it made a mark
So over these games but now I need you
Another place, another time

It was always in our teenage minds
Teenage minds
Another place, another time
It was always in our teenage minds

I could almost feel the taste of you
The Lucky Strike that we used to do
Stole a bottle of expensive wine
Just to share with you
You said that we should be dreaming of being something better
Oh babe, that was an endless time
Your body close to mine

And none of our friends would believe us
'Cause we left it in the dark
And now I know it made a mark
So over these games but now I need you
Another place, another time

It was always in our teenage minds
Teenage minds
Another place, another time
It was always in our teenage minds

'Cause we left it in the dark
And now I know it made a mark
So over these games but now I need you

It was always in our teenage minds
Teenage minds
Another place, another time
It was always in our teenage minds

Oh yeah yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah
Teenage minds
Oh yeah yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah
Another place, another time
