I see you on the blue skies
I need a little sunshine
I fell into your brown eyes
I told you I was your light

No, I don't wanna talk about it
I don't wanna listen all that much
Is it falling apart?
I don't wanna talk about it
I just wanna hold your hand

Oh, you know when you're alone
I'm holding on
And on and on and on
Oh, you know when you're alone
I'm holding on
And on and on and on
To your soul
Your soul

So shy
You must have been so tired
Don't cry
I must have been so blind
Oh, you know when you're alone
I'm holding on
And on and on and on
Oh, you know when you're alone
I'm holding on
And on and on and on
To your soul
Your soul
Your soul
Your soul

No, I don't wanna talk about it
I don't wanna listen all that much
Is it falling apart?
I don't wanna talk about it
I just wanna hold your hand

Oh, you know when you're alone
I'm holding on
And on and on and on
Oh, you know when you're alone
I'm holding on
And on and on and on
To your soul
Your soul
Your soul
Your soul
To your soul
Your soul
Your soul
Your soul

No, I don't wanna talk about it
