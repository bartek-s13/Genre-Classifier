You got those eyes stare into my soul
You get that smile when I知 giving you my all
The only thing I ever knew is that I never know
I致e had my time in the sun and now I gotta go
But can I call you home
You値l be mine and I値l be yours
I just wanna let you know
In my mind I call you home
But can I call you home
You値l be mine and I値l be yours
Can I call you home
You値l be mine and I値l be yours
I just wanna let you know
In my mind I call you home
And I...
The only thing I ever knew is that I never know
I致e had my time in the sun and now I gotta go
You池e the brighter side of things
You池e the lighter side of life
And all the joy that you bring
Is why I need you in my life
But can I call you home
You値l be mine and I値l be yours
I just wanna let you know
In my mind I call you home
