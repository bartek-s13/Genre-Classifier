<<<<<<< HEAD
Words are fallin' on our skin
Like water torture, you get in my head
You call me this, and I call you that
There's too much talkin', mmm

So please don't speak
M, my heart is havin' trouble with the beat, beat, beat
So try to take it slow
We can't speak
I want it, I'm just tryin' to find the beat, beat, beat
My heart is singing low

We can lay together
We're closer than we've ever been
Stay right here forever
And break each other off again

Where we're going, that promised land
We made that promise, you gave me your hand
All that talkin', it pulled us in
Say you'd never leave, can we promise that?

Please don't speak
My heart is having trouble with the beat, beat, beat
So try to take it slow
We can't speak
I'm tryin', I just wanna find the beat, beat, beat
My heart is singing low

We can lay together
We're closer than we've ever been
Stay right here forever
And break each other off again

Woah-oh-oh-oh
Can we lay, can we lay, can we lay, can we lay?
Woah-oh-oh-oh
We can lay together
We're closer than we've ever been
Stay right here forever
We'll find a way to love again
Let's find a way to love again
Can we find a way to love?

We can lay together
We're closer than we've ever been
Stay right here forever
And break each other off again

Woah-oh-oh-oh
