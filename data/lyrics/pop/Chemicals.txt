I fell in love with the chemicals
I used to pray for a miracle, but now
I know that it's all over
We used to sit by the waterside
I'd kiss your cheek and say, "You're mine"
But now I know it's over

And all these little things, they start to slip away, hmm
And all these little things, they start to fade away
And you said

"Hold me, I'm falling apart
'Cause I'm scared and lost in the dark
And this feeling surely cannot last"
So I took it away, I took it away
Away from you
Mmm, woah, woah

I held your hand but you let it go
And I knew your heart had found a home
And now I know it's over
I flew it out into the sky
Was tryna run from this mountain I couldn't climb
'Cause I knew I'd fall over
And all these little things, they start to slip away, hmm
And all these little things, they start to fade away
And you said

"Hold me, I'm falling apart
'Cause I'm scared and lost in the dark
And this feeling surely cannot last"
So I took it away, I took it away

We were making plans and breaking dreams
When you were next to me
It's 3AM in the back of a cab
And I am begging on my knees
Don't go, won't you stay?
I can't stand to watch you walk away from me
And you said

"Hold me, I'm falling apart
'Cause I'm scared and lost in the dark
And this feeling surely cannot last"
So I took it away, I took it away
Away from you
