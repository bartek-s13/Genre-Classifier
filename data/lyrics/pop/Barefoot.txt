I know I'm more than alive
Barefoot, I'd walk my own line
We keep our heads up

Fast feet, I'd run for my life
Teacher, try blindfold my eyes
We keep our heads up

Here we go, let's become creatures
All alone, runnin' from evil
We don't trip up easy

Light us up, hunt us down like we're
Animals, running wild, you'll see
We don't trip up easy
We don't trip up easy

Tie up our teeth to the door
Slam shut, we'll bleed 'til we're bored
We keep our heads up
Blame us, don't take all the hits
Let go, we're more than just kids
We keep our heads up

Here we go, let's become creatures
All alone, runnin' from evil
We don't trip up easy

Light us up, hunt us down like we're
Animals, running wild, you'll see
