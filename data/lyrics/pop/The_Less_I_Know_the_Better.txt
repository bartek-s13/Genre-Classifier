Someone said they left together, I ran out the door to get her
She was holding hands with Trevor, not the greatest feeling ever
Said, "Pull yourself together, you should try your luck with Heather"
Then I heard they slept together, oh, the less I know the better
The less I know the better

Oh my love, can't you see yourself by my side?
No surprise when you're on his shoulder like every night
Oh my love, can't you see that you're on my mind
Don't suppose we could convince your lover to change his mind
So goodbye

She said, "It's not now or never, wait ten years, we'll be together"
I said, "Better late than never, just don't make me wait forever"
Don't make me wait forever
Don't make me wait forever

Oh my love, can't you see yourself by my side?
I don't suppose you could convince your lover to change his mind

I was doing fine without ya till I saw your face, now I can't erase
Giving in to all his bullshit, is this what you want? Is this who you are?
I was doing fine without ya till I saw your eyes turn away from mine
Oh, sweet darling, where he wants you, said, "Come on, Superman, say your stupid line"
Said, "Come on, Superman, say your stupid line"
