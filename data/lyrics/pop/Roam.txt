<<<<<<< HEAD
Alone again, under the city lights
Wasting away, don't wanna lose myself tonight
Battle through the waves, a renegade
Against the grey surrounding me
I was born to fight, made to forge the way
I'm here to stay
It don't matter where we come from or where we'll go
Cos baby, we've been searching for it way too long
No we're not gonna find it if we're standing still
So, baby, come with me
And maybe then you'll see
Everywhere I roam is home
Everywhere I roam is home
Everywhere I roam is home
Home, home, home, home
I just wanna return, where my feet stood so firm
(Gotta let it go, I just wanna know)
When it's growing colder and it's far from over
(Gotta hold tight, just another night)
Battle through the waves, a renegade
Against the grey surrounding me
I was born to fight, made to forge the way
I'm here to stay
It don't matter where we come from or where we'll go
Cos baby, we've been searching for it way too long
No we're not gonna find it if we're standing still
So, baby, come with me
And maybe then you'll see
Everywhere I roam is home
Everywhere I roam is home
Everywhere I roam is home
Home, home, home, home
Everywhere I roam is home
Everywhere I roam is home
Everywhere I roam is home
Home, home, home, home
It don't matter where we come from or where we'll go

No we're not gonna find it if we're standing still
So, baby, come with me

And maybe then you'll see
Everywhere I roam is home
Everywhere I roam is home
Everywhere I roam is home
Home, home, home, home
Everywhere I roam is home
Everywhere I roam is home
