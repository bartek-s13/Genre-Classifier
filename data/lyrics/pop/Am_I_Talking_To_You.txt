Did you just tell me that you never wanna see me again?
I guess it's hard to see me when your eyes are wide and bloodshot red
Go ahead to the random you just met
Take her back to a lifelong friend
You think you're happy, do you really wanna keep me wondering?

Am I talking to you?
I don't think you know what you're saying
I know you're tryna be cool
But I'm about to run out of patience
I want to
But am I really talking to you?

I need to see you, try to reach you, you're not picking up the phone
Are you alone? Are you breathing? Are you facedown on the kitchen floor?
Can't you see you are hurting me?
This isn't just about you anymore, oh
Will I find the one, I know, will I have to ask once more?

Am I talking to you?
I don't think you know what you're saying
I know you're tryna be cool
But I'm about to run out of patience
I want to
But am I really talking to you?
You can tell me anything, just let me help you
I look at you the same way, just let me help you

Am I talking to you?
I really wanna know what you're saying
I know you're tryna be cool
But I'm not gonna run out of patience
I want to
But am I really talking to you?

Am I really talking to you?
Am I really talking to you?
Am I really talking to you?
