Like cactus trees, my heart had shields
It was lonely before you
Like autumn leafs, blew away my spears
I stood naked before you

Will you guard my heart in the ocean wild
Will you hold me tight, love me back to life
Will you?
Will you?
Will you stand by me like an army now
I've never loved somebody like I loved ya
Like you, like you..

Cause I've, I've never loved somebody
I've never loved somebody like you

It's silent here
Those sun ray flares is the only thing that moves
Like mountain tops and old red rocks
You said: "I'll stand tall for you"
Will you guard my heart in the ocean wild
Will you hold me tight, love me back to life
Will you?
Will you?
Will you stand by me like an army now
I've never loved somebody like I loved ya
Like you
Like you

Cause I've, I've never loved somebody
I've never loved somebody like you

Will you stand by me like an army now
Will you stand by me like an army now
Will you stand by me like an army now
I've never loved somebody like I loved ya
Like you
Like you
Will you stand by me like an army now
I've never loved somebody like I loved ya
Like you
Like you
Cause I've, I've never loved somebody
I've never loved somebody like you
