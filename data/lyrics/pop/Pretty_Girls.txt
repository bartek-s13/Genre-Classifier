Pretty girls
They never notice ugly boys like me
Even if I wear my heart on sleeves
They always seem to put me down

Pretty girls
They always seem to bite so hard
Even when I say don’t play
Insists that I will stay till dark

Its okay, I don’t much care
For the kempt hair, that’s just all looks
And if you say, that you do care
What people stare, then that’s how you look

Pretty girls
They always want to be alone
But every time they're by themselves
They always tell me help yourself

Pretty girls
They never deal with sadness well
And never think about their joys
That’s why they need ugly boys
Its okay, I don’t much care
For the kempt hair, that’s just all looks
And if you say, that you do care
What people stare, then that’s how you look
 (Spoken)
Hey there baby I just wanted to let you know that
Its pretty hard being so damn pretty
And whenever you feel sad and blue
Just know that I am the one watching you while you sleep
The one that feels your tears drip down to your pillow
And hears all your dreams, nightmares and inhibitions
You pretty pretty girl

Did the girls go? Oh
