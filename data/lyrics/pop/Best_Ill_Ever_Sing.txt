Maybe I'm better off
A little taller now you're gone
Writing words and they don't sting
But they don't mean half as much without you listening

The crying at the piano
You're like stood in the shadows
When I try to soften my words

Maybe we brought out the worst in each other
A million full stops on our skin
But baby the songs that I wrote as your other
Are the best I'll ever sing
'Cause they all go ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Like there was a choir in every line back then
'Cause they all go ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
And that was the best I'll ever sing

I don't see you at my shows
'Cause if you heard this, it would cut too close
Wish I could stop writing us, God knows I've tried
Every moment immortalized

Crying at the piano
You're like stood in the shadows
When I try to soften my words

Oh, maybe we brought out the worst in each other
A million full stops on our skin
But baby the songs that I wrote as your other
Are the best I'll ever sing
'Cause they were like ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Like there was a choir in every line back then
They all go ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
And that was the best I'll ever sing

And when the curtain falls, I'll bury you again
Every lyric is a letter that I'll never send
A piece of me from when

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
There was a choir in every line back then
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
And that was the best I'll ever sing
Maybe we brought out the worst in each other
A million full stops on our skin
But baby the songs that I wrote as your other
