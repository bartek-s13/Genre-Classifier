Take me back to that happy time
When gunshots seemed like fireworks to me
How could it be?
Take me back to that happy place
A race was just a playground game to me
Was it a dream?

Life's not story time
But I won't live afraid to die, will you?

Put your hands up, your hands up
Let your heart break the handcuffs
Put your hands up, your hands up
Let your heart break the handcuffs

I can't go back, though I've tried
To erase the sounds of sirens in my sleep
How could it be?
And the TV screens growing wider
Showing me a world I can't have, oh-oh
Is this a dream?

Life's not story time
But I won't live afraid to die, will you?

Put your hands up, your hands up
Let your heart break the handcuffs
Put your hands up, your hands up
Let your heart break the handcuffs

Mm, mm, mm, mm
(Let your heart break the handcuffs)
Mm, mm, mm, mm
(Let your heart break the handcuffs)

Put your hands up, your hands up (Mm, mm)
Let your heart break the handcuffs (Mm)
Put your hands up, your hands up (Mm, mm)
