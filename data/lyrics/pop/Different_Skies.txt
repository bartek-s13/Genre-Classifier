I memorized the nights we had in Cali
Mary Jane and fast food runs, in the valley
But like the signal, you came and gone
First love didn't last too long

Wake up to different skies
I know that both of us tried
You say you're happier with him now
Maybe I'm just in denial
Can't see you walking the aisle
With that other guy by your side

My heart still calls out your name baby
It's not good for my health, going crazy
Sleepless nights, we talked till the sun
Now your beat's on a different drum, oh yeah

Wake up to different skies
I know that both of us tried
You say you're happier with him now
Maybe I'm just in denial
Can't see you walking the aisle
With that other guy by your side
Motherfucker came out of nowhere and took your hand yeah
You had to go NFL blitz on my soul now I'm feeling the pain
I am somewhere between nostalgia and heartache
You are fake, you are plastic, hope you're fantastic
I am out, have a good life

Wake up to different skies
I know that both of us tried
You say you're happier with him now
Maybe I'm just in denial
Can't see you walking the aisle
With that other guy by your side
