Turning to the blackness, to the blackness
Waiting for the badness, for the badness
Gave myself to madness, to the madness
Craving for the badness, for the badness
Turning to the blackness
Waiting for the badness
Gave myself to madness
Craving for the badness
I'll fall if you do, I'll fall
Show me how to hold you (I'll fall)
Show me how to hold you
Take me where you're going
Don't you let me waste you
Holding to the deep end
I'll let go if you do
Hot blood running through me
Falling wild and I'm free
Take you where I'm going
I won't let you waste me
I'll fall if you do, I'll fall
I'll follow the madness behind you
I'll follow the mad
Show me how to hold you (I'll fall)
Show me how to hold you
Take me where I want to (I'll follow the mad)
Take me where I want to
Turning to the blackness, to the blackness
