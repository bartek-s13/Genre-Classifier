He goes to college and gathers knowledge
Gee, what that boy knows
And I gotta have some lovin'
He says, Please Stop it, please
He's so unusual

Yo, Alice Ivy, Rara
Oh-Oh
Yeah my heart is doing better
Yeah my heart is doing better
Yeah my heart is doing better
Yeah my heart is doing better
Yeah you know you know
Yeah, I'm doing it better
Put my thoughts in a letter
Had a point where you fed up
Now you're asking me questions
Yeah, I'm always upset
Now that you池e restless
You're asking these questions
Yeah I want to confess
I've got so much confession
I don't know my inflection
We chasing perfection
We need to chill for a minute
Yeah, you know I'm committed
In the booth when I hit it
Then the stage to get lift
Never quit, I could get it
We're attracted to passion
Keep my heart in the fashion
And my mind and my actions
Done trippin' and fastin
Tape thick as molasses
Causing havoc and crashes
Cooling out in the breeze
Girl I知 wild as a team
Yeah, we're jumping at the gym with it
And now I can sing
Cause I知 free with it

When I need you, you're never here
I was swallowing my tears
Yeah Maybe I知 wrong what we can do
Loving a man, a man like you
When I need you, you're never here
I was swallowing my tears
Yeah Maybe I知 wrong what we can do
Loving a man, a man like you
Yeah, yeah
Loving a man like you

Each one of you has a your pin up girl
I had to go so don稚 trip I told ya
Pablo Picasso paint a picture for ya
Didn稚 commit a thing
But that痴 why what we goes through so confusing
I知 talking so dope to you
You doing betta
I知 doing betta
The queens feel light
The jeans are good leather
I知 in the good weather then in Dubai
Yea all the sand make me think I知 goin die
Then it make me feel pride cuz I fly
Red yellow and black
You see the truth on ground you stand
I知 reppin where I aim now, I知 reppin the real one
16 strips is the basis I build on
Insert king now I知 startin to feel one
Instead of making scenes I be startin to steal one

When I need you, you're never here
I was swallowing my tears
Maybe I知 wrong what we can do
Loving a man, a man like you
When I need you, you're never here
I was swallowing my tears
Maybe I知 wrong what we can do
Loving a man, a man like you
