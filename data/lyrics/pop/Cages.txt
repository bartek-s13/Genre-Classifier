Nobody taught me ‘bout the cages
Lord I can see the pain from here
Saying wake me up and show me please
Wake me up and save me

Don’t leave, don’t leave, leave me
Oh don’t leave, don’t leave
'Cause now I see ya
Now I breathe ya
Now I feel ya
Oh oh oh

I remember back to October
Please be good to me
October, please be good to me
October, oh oh, October
Please, October, oh oh

Oh I was never meant to hide it
But oh they can see it all so clear
And if they won’t wake me up and show me
Then I’m gonna take me home
And I’m gonna save me
Don’t leave, don’t leave, leave me
Oh don’t leave, don’t leave
'Cause now I see ya
Now I breathe ya
Now I feel ya
Oh oh oh

I remember back to October
Please be good to me
October, please be good to me
October, oh oh, October
Please, October, oh oh

And just like you
I get charmed by the words of the day
And just like you
I lived by these words
But these words won’t
Wake me up and save me
So I’m gonna take me home
And I’m gonna save me

But I remember back to October
Please be good to me
October, please be good to me
October, please be good to me
October, oh oh, October
Please, October, oh oh
October, please be good to me
October, please be good to me
October, please be good to me
October, please be good to me
October
