Day and night
I miss your body every day and night
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Would you please
Come over here, I want that sugar sweet
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
'Cause today, today is like
My birthday, birthday, so we could go
Shake it, shake it all n-n-n-night
This is your invitation
We get, we gettin' wasted
Shake it, shake it all n-n-n-night
I'm waiting on you in my birthday suit
Bring your balloons, it's just me and you
We'll be waking up on the floor
Brought this candle, ready for more
Waiting on you in my birthday suit
Birthday suit
Waiting on you in my birthday suit
Close your eyes
I promise you, I'll keep you so surprised
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
So make a wish
We can do whatever, I don't give a shit
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
'Cause today, today is like
My birthday, birthday, so we could go
Shake it, shake it all n-n-n-night
This is your invitation
We get, we gettin' wasted
Shake it, shake it all n-n-n-night
I'm waiting on you in my birthday suit
Bring your balloons, it's just me and you
We'll be waking up on the floor
Brought this candle, ready for more
Waiting on you in my birthday suit
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
Waiting on you in my birthday suit
I got some money in my pocket
That I'm ready to blow
And you'll be coming, I'm so late
You don't even wanna know
And, baby, once you get a taste of it
You'll come back for more
I'm waiting on you in my birthday suit
(It's my birthday, bitches)
I'm waiting on you in my birthday suit
Bring your balloons, it's just me and you
We'll be waking up on the floor
Brought this candle, ready for more
Waiting on you in my birthday suit
Birthday suit
I'm waiting on you in my birthday suit
