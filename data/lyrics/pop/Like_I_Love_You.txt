Oh it's a long way down
But if you don’t look, you don't have to know it
And I can be around
To catch your fall if you're losing your grip

Can’t you see that I come crawling on my knees
To get to you, get to you, get to you
Can't you see that I climb mountains just to be
Next to you, next to you, next to you

But do you love me like I love you?
Don't have to rush if you don't want to
Oh I'll be patient
But just know that there's no way that anybody else could love you
Like I love you

Like I love you
Love you
Like I love you
Love you

Know you've been hurt before (fore, fore)
But a little love is enough to save ya
Yeah, we could take our time for sure
'Cause something real is worth the waiting
Can’t you see that I come crawling on my knees
To get to you, get to you, get to you
Can’t you see I swim the ocean just to be
Next to you, next to you, next to you

But do you love me like I love you?
Don't have to rush if you don’t want to
Oh I'll be patient
But just know that there's no way that anybody else could love you
Like I love you

Like I love you
Love you
Like I love you
Love you

I know you wanted me but
You won't surrender your heart
Keeping me out in the dark, keeping me out in the dark
I know you wanted me but
She won’t surrender your heart
Keeping me out in the dark, keeping me out in the dark
In the dark
Do you love me like I love you?
Don't have to rush if you don't want to
Oh I'll be patient
But just know that there's no way that anybody else could love you
Like I love you

Like I love you (nobody else could)
Love you (nobody else could)
Like I love you
Love you

Like I love you
