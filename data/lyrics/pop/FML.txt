(Um, Reuel, stop playing)

Yeah, I see you got that new Mercedes
I might let you drive me crazy
Usually I ain't the type to stay, uh
'Cause you could fall in and go psycho
Ain't no tellin' where this might go
But I take my chances either way

So come and fuck my life up, baby
Fuck my life up
Come and fuck my life up, baby
Fuck my life up
Come and fuck my life up, baby
Fuck my life up
Come and fuck my life up, baby
Fuck my life up
(Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

You look like somebody that could really hold it down (Down)
You look like somebody that would always stick around ('Round)
Got Latina in you, so I know you probably crazy (Loco)
All my friends said stay away but that shit just don't phase me (Uh)
Got a little bit of sassy, I like that
You don't take no shit, yeah you fight back (Fight)
Never let a dude hit it on the first night (No)
I can't even sleep over 'til I wife that
All these bitches in my phone, hit the boy up
But I've been curving everyone for you (Brr, brr, brr)
Girl I would give you every single password
All you gotta do is let me through, yeah
I'ma keep it honest (Honest)
I know that you got a past (Past)
I know you ain't perfect (Perfect)
But basic bitches never last (Last)
I don't usually do this type of shit
So baby trust me when I tell you that I'm all about it (I'm all about it)
Yeah, I might fall in love and let you fuck my life up
Just so I could go and write a song about it

Yeah, I see you got that new Mercedes
I might let you drive me crazy
Usually I ain't the type to stay (Type to stay, no)
'Cause you could fall in and go psycho
Ain't no tellin' where this might go
But I take my chances either way

Last man left you broken hearted
Let me treat you right (Right)
Shorty if you need me I can pull up any night (Night)
You just say the words, girl, I don't need a reason
Give me something more than just a lover on the weekend

I see you got that new Mercedes
I might let you drive me crazy
Usually I ain't the type to stay (Type to stay, no)
'Cause you could fall in, go psycho
Ain't no tellin' where this might go
But I take my chances either way
