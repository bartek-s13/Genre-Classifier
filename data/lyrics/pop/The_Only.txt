I can't be the only one who's lonely tonight
I can't be the only

One who's drinking by myself
Wishing that I was somewhere else
Talking to the voices in my head
Because at least they're listening
Right here's an easy place to hide
I stay in bed and shut the blinds
Don't even know where I would go

But I know that there's gotta be somebody out there
There's gotta be somebody somewhere who needs company
And it's comforting to know

I can't be the only one who's lonely tonight
No, I can't be the only

One with nobody to call
This city makes me feel so small
A million people in this town
But I could scream without a sound
So I get high to pass the time
Talk to someone I met online
To make myself feel less alone

'Cause I know that there's gotta be somebody out there
There's gotta be somebody somewhere who needs company
And it's comforting to know

I can't be the only one who's lonely tonight
No, I can't be the only

No, I can't be the only one who's lonely tonight
No, I can't be the only one who's lonely
