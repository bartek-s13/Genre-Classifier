Loving ain't easy
But I don't think that is an excuse
Cause loving you is all I wanna do
If you let me try
Yeah we got jealous
Trust issues were all that we could trust
Yeah it's true, we really fucked it up
But can we make it right?
Cause love is a game I never win
If I ain't got you on my team
Baby can we start again?
Let's start again
So start again
Waste all my time, be crazy, I don't mind
Cause I will always love you twice
My flag is white, fight if you want to fight
As long as you still love me twice
I know we're not perfect
But I like the stupid things you do
And when you get mad you're kinda cute
So can we make it right?
Cause love is a game I never win
If I ain't got you on my team
Baby can we start again?
Let's start again
So start again
Waste all my time, be crazy, I don't mind
Cause I will always love you twice
My flag is white, fight if you want to fight
As long as you still love me twice
Loving isn't easy
Loving isn't easy
Oh loving isn't easy
But I will love you every time
Loving isn't easy
Loving isn't easy
Oh loving isn't easy
But I will love you every time
Cause love is a game I never win
If I ain't got you on my team
Baby can we start again?
Let's start again
So start again
Waste all my time, be crazy, I don't mind
Cause I will always love you twice
Cause my flag is white, fight if you want to fight
As long as you still love me twice
Oh won't you waste all my time, be crazy, I don't mind
Cause I will always love you twice
Oh my flag is white, fight if you want to fight
As long as you still love me twice
Loving isn't easy
Loving isn't easy
Oh loving isn't easy
But I will love you every time
Loving isn't easy
Loving isn't easy
Oh loving isn't easy
But I will love you every time
