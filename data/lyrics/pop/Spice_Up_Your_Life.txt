When you're feeling sad and low
We will take you, where you gotta go
Smiling dancing, everything is free
All you need is, positivity

Colours of the world (Spice up your life)
Every boy and every girl (Spice up your life)
People of the world (Spice up your life, ahh)

Slam it to the left (if you're havin' a good time)
Shake it to the right (if you know that you feel fine)
Chicas to the front (uh, uh)
Go round
Slam it to the left (if you're havin' a good time)
Shake it to the right (if you know that you feel fine)
Chicas to the front (uh, uh)
Hai, sí, ja! Hold tight!

Yellow man in Timbuktu
Colourful both, me and you
Kung Fu fighting, dancing queen
Tribal spaceman, and all that's in between

Flamenco, lambada
But hip hop is harder
(We moonwalk the foxtrot)
(Then polka, the salsa)
Shake it shake it shake it, haka
Shake it shake it shake it, haka
Arriba! Aha
