Let's go!
Precious woman from tomorrow
Are you sorry 'cause you'll love me?
Could this tune ease down your anger?
Are you sorry 'cause you'll love me once?
Will you take revenge on my back?
Are you gonna let me wonder?
Will your friends become my enemies?
Are you sorry 'cause you'll love me once?
'Cause every single thing is in my future past
I'm running out of time and I know
That it will never last
Let's go! / Lets go!
Are you gonna make me stumble?
When you're all alone in the night
Could this song become thunder?
Every move you make with your thighs
Will you take me back where I belong?
You belong to where I belong
Are you sorry 'cause you'll love me once?
Every single thing is in my future past
I'm running out of time and I know
That it will never last
Every now and then I feel that I can trust
The love you've given me
But deep inside I know that it will never last
In the night
In the night
In the night
In the night
Ya ya ya! Oh oh oh!
Ya ya ya! Oh oh oh!
Oh oh oh!
Ya ya ya! Oh oh oh!
In the night
Oh oh oh!
In the night
Oh oh oh!
In the night!
'Cause every single thing is in my future past
I'm running out of time and I know
That it will never last / uh!
Every now and then I feel that I can trust
The love you've given me
But deep inside I know that it will never last / Oh oh oh oh oh!
Na ah ah ah ah! Oh oh oh oh oh!
Na ah ah ah ah! Oh oh oh oh oh!
Na ah ah ah ah! Oh oh oh oh oh!
Na ah ah ah ah! Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!
Are you sorry?
In the night
Are you sorry?
In the night
Are you sorry?
In the night
Are you sorry?
In the night
Yea hea!
Are you Sorry?
