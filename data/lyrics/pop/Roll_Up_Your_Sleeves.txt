Roll up your sleeves
And face the face it’s looking right back at me
It’s easier to leave it oh
It’s easier to fake it, oh oh
So I’ll go and I’ll join the free
There’s people there, they’re just like me oh

Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright

Oh, they’re hunting me
And he is not fancy, he just wears black head to toe
And oh, they’re hunting me
So I’ll go and I’ll change my name
But they’re chasing them just like me

Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright

Roll up your sleeves
And roll up your sleeves
Everything is gonna be alright
