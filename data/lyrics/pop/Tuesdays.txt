Two years this summer
I knew it from the day I saw her
We were gonna be together
That's why
I'm here to see her
She doesn't know I'm in Virginia
But I know she's mine forever
So I'm askin' for your blessin'
And maybe just one lesson
He said, "Twenty-seven years, and here's my takeaway,"

It's not just picture perfect dancing in a white dress
It's not just rainy days when nothing stops the fighting
It's not just highs and lows, and champagne toast
I've come to know that love's not only the best days
Or the worst days
Love is the Tuesdays
Yeah, love is the Tuesdays

It's breakfast thrown together
While she's sleepin' in your high school sweater
And you've never seen anything better
It's the season three you're watching
A little bit of evenin' walkin'
And sittin' with your best friend talkin'

Oh, it's not just picture perfect dancing in a white dress
It's not just rainy days when nothing stops the fighting
It's not just highs and lows, and champagne toast
I've come to know that love's not only the best days
Or the worst days
Love is the Tuesdays
Yeah, love is the Tuesdays

No, it's not Hollywoods' sign
Cause troubles will come
But it's the best decision you're ever gonna make
And you've got my blessing
But just hear this lesson
Twenty-seven years and all I've gotta say

It's not just picture perfect dancing in a white dress
It's not just rainy days when nothing stops the fighting
It's not just highs and lows, and champagne toast
I've come to know that love's not only the best days
Or the worst days
Love is the Tuesdays
Yeah, love is the Tuesdays
Oh, love is the Tuesdays
