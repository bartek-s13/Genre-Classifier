God damn, I didn't see it
When you lived here all your life, but didn't mean it
And I swear, I know what green is
But it's hard sometimes to breathe in all the scenics

Dream of palaces and countrysides
All I want, want, want
Is to wake up with the morning light
Laughing all along
Break away from all the city lights
Hiding in the dark
'Cause you don't belong where you don't belong
Yeah, I don't belong

No, I don't belong
No, I don't belong
No, I don't belong
No, I don't belong
But I get along where I don't belong

Yeah, yeah
Da-da-da-da, mmm
I'm blessed
I'll believe it when they tell me I'm here for a reason
Hold on, another season
Couple minutes back and forth, and we'll be leaving

To our palaces and countrysides
All I want, want, want
Is to wake up with the morning light
Laughing all along
Break away from all the city lights
Hiding in the dark
'Cause you don't belong where you don't belong
Yeah, I don't belong

No, I don't belong
No, I don't belong
No, I don't belong
No, I don't belong
But I get along where I don't belong

No, no
It's just a feeling, just a feeling
It's just a feeling, just a feeling
It's just a feeling, just a feeling
It's just a feeling, just a feeling
Dream of palaces and countrysides
All I want, want, want
Is to wake up with the morning light
Laughing all along
Break away from all the city lights
Hiding in the dark
'Cause you don't belong where you don't belong
Yeah, I don't belong

No, I don't belong
No, I don't belong
No, I don't belong
No, I don't belong
But I get along where I don't belong
