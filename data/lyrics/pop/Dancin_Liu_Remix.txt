Get up on the floor
Dancin' all night long
Get up on the floor
Dancin’ till the break of dawn
Get up on the floor
Dancin' till the break of dawn
Get up on the floor
Dancin'

All the time
My baby you on my mind
And I don’t know why
Yeah but the feeling is fine
Can't you see
Honey you are for me
Though it weren't meant to be

Dancin' in the moonlight
Gazing at the stars so bright
Holding you until the sunrise
Sleeping until the midnight

Get up on the floor
Dancin' all night long
Get up on the floor
Dancin' till the break of dawn
Get up on the floor
Dancin' till the break of dawn
Get up on the floor

All the time
My baby you on my mind
And I don't know why
Yeah but the feeling is fine
Can't you see
Honey you are for me
Though it weren’t meant to be

Dancin' in the moonlight
Gazing at the stars so bright
Holding you until the sunrise
Sleeping until the midnight

Get up on the floor
Dancin' all night long
Get up on the floor
Dancin' till the break of dawn
Get up on the floor
Dancin' till the break of dawn
