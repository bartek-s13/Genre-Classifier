Just a little bit tired of you
Just a little bit lonely for you
Just a little bit high, get out of my mind
'Cause I can't stop thinkin' of you
Feel a little bit sorry
But I wanna get on it with you
I don't wanna waste time
I don't wanna say "bye", no

I feel it in my head, feel it in my heart, feel it in my body
But I can't say "no", no, I can't say "no"
You're playin' with my head, playin' with my heart
Playin' with my body, but I can't let go, no, I can't let go

I fuckin' hate you
But I love you just the same
You tear my heart out
In just the perfect way
So fuckin' twisted
The way I play your game
But I can't help it
I love you just the same

I love you just the same
(I love you just the sa–)

I'm a little bit crazy for you
Just sittin' here waitin' for you
I'm a little bit down, I'm just gonna go out
I don't wanna be home without you
Feel way too sorry
But I'm gonna get on it with you
It's the middle of the night
And I'm not saying "bye", no

I feel it in my head, feel it in my heart, feel it in my body
But I can't say "no", no, I can't say "no"
You're playin' with my head, playin' with my heart
Playin' with my body, but I can't let go, no, I can't let go

I fuckin' hate you
But I love you just the same
You tear my heart out
In just the perfect way
So fuckin' twisted
The way I play your game
But I can't help it
I love you just the same

I love you just the same
I love you just the same
I love you just the same
(I love you just the same)

I fuckin' hate you
But I love you just the same
You tear my heart out
In just the perfect way
So fuckin' twisted
The way I play your game
But I can't help it
I love you just the same
I fuckin' hate you (I fuckin' hate you)
But I love you just the same
You tear my heart out
In just the perfect way
So fuckin' twisted
The way I play your game
But I can't help it (I can't)
I love you just the same (Sa-same)

I love you just the same (Sa-same)
I love you just the same
