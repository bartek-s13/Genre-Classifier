They think Nut is a joke?
Bitches ain’t fucking on me cause I’m broke
They flop and they choke
I’m in my corolla, I’m sippin’ some cola
I am the controlla, I’m bringing the smoke
Not construction, I don’t play with the bricks
But I tickle on her nipple, I’m just getting my kicks
Lil Nut in the cut tryna’ get me a cut, then I fuck around and put it in her butt
I’m not playing now
One star on my feet, gold on my teeth
Lil mama in the crib, I don’t wanna speak
Scarface in the face with a striped shirt
Bitches all up on my dick, why my knees hurt?
Critics are sleeping on me, I got gas
Go buy jelly beans just to shove up my ass
This bitch sucked my dick, bit the tip, gave me rabies
Nut on her egg, I got hard boiled babies

Pull up I’m whipping a brand new Mercedes
Selling my soul, there’s no way you can save me
There’s no way you can save me
You can’t save me
Fuck it I’m back on the beat!
Bitches ain’t fuckin’ on me ‘cause I’m weak
I just hit my peak
I didn’t hit puberty, this shit is new to me
Everyone’s coolin’
I’m bringing the heat
Tryna’ get head from a rabbit, that’s carrot top
Bitch lick my ass and she bald like she Avatar
Fuck around and played with this shit and I’m lyrical
You don’t hear it though, but I hear it though
Fuck around and I suck on my bro’s tit
Put my new shit on and I’m posted (Fuck off my dick!)
And I only drink water
Respecting these women, I feel like their father
How I’m doing this shit when I’m nineteen?
Money keep coming, it’s coming All Green
Bitch call me toothbrush, I’m all about that Oral B
Young Nut on top and there’s no one in front of me

Go buy jelly beans just to shove up my ass
