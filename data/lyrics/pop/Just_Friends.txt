Remember your apartment
When you said
You don't wanna waste any more time
On let downs or heart breaks?
Now we're day drunk
In the backseat of a taxi
And you're telling me you wanna kiss me
But we shouldn't 'cause we're just friends

Maybe we could go get lost tonight
At least we know that we gave it a try

So why don't we go out and get a drink in the West end?
Smoke a cigarette and talk shit about exes
Take a couple shots and see where the night ends
Stop pretending like we're just friends
Why don't we go out and get a drink in the West end?
One more dance, are you feeling the tension?
Take a couple shots and see where the night ends
Stop pretending like we're just friends
Stop pretending like we're just friends
Stop pretending like we're just friends

Tomorrow when it's over
And we're sober
I just wanna believe that you'll miss me
But I shouldn't 'cause we're just friends
Now we're day drunk
In the backseat of a taxi
And you're telling me you want to kiss me
But we shouldn't 'cause we're just friends

Maybe we could go get lost tonight
At least we know that we gave it a try

So why don't we go out and get a drink in the West end?
Smoke a cigarette and talk shit about exes
Take a couple shots and see where the night ends
Stop pretending like we're just friends
Why don't we go out and get a drink in the West end?
One more dance, are you feeling the tension?
Take a couple shots and see where the night ends
Stop pretending like we're just friends
Stop pretending like we're just friends
Stop pretending like we're just friends

Maybe we could go get lost tonight
At least we know that we gave it a try

So why don't we go out and get a drink in the West end?
Smoke a cigarette and talk shit about exes
Take a couple shots and see where the night ends
Stop pretending like we're just friends
Why don't we go out and get a drink in the West end?
One more dance, are you feeling the tension?
Take a couple shots and see where the night ends
Stop pretending like we're just friends

Stop pretending like we're just friends
Stop pretending like we're just friends
