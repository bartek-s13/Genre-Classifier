We're not gonna have that talk, it's already been said
I'd given you my hand before, get too easily led
Played my heartstrings so perfectly, left unraveling
Went further than you know
I'm sure flowers still need to grow though
I'm sorry
You don't even enter my thoughts
I don't wait for your calls
You can pretend till the end
I walked you out my door
Inside, been working hard I get by
Just keepin ahead of their headlights
I used to be the one you'd call
And you'd always get fed
You should learn to stand up tall
Not spend hours in bed
Now my heart sings in different keys with new harmony
Come further than you know, I'm sure
Flowers still need to grow though
I'm sorry
You don't even enter my thoughts
I don't wait for your calls
You can pretend till the end
I walked you out my door
Inside, been working hard I get by
Just keeping ahead of their headlights
But don't be taking it lightly, unwise
Just go sharpen your mind
Eventually you'll pay the price
We've all got hills to climb
And sleepless nights
You don't even enter my thoughts
And I don't wait for your call
You can pretend till the end
I walked you out my door
Inside, been working hard I get by
Just keeping ahead of their headlights
You could escape those thoughts
You could open new doors
Maybe you'd jump to the front maybe
You'd pass us all
Inside, been working hard, I get by
Just keeping ahead of your headlights
