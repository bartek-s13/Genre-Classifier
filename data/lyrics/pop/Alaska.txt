I was walking through icy streams
That took my breath away
Moving slowly through westward water
Over glacial plains

And I walked off you
And I walked off an old me
Oh me, oh my, I thought it was a dream
So it seemed

And now, breathe deep
I'm inhaling
You and I, there's air in between
Leave me be
I'm exhaling
You and I, there's air in between
Ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo-ooh
Ooh-hoo-ooh
You and I, there's air in between
Ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo-ooh
Ooh-hoo-ooh

Cut my hair so I could rock back and forth
Without thinking of you
Learned to talk and say
Whatever I wanted to
And I walked off you
And I walked off an old me
Oh me, oh my, I thought it was a dream
So it seemed

And now, breathe deep
I'm inhaling
You and I, there's air in between
Leave me be
I'm exhaling
You and I, there's air in between
Ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo-ooh
Ooh-hoo-ooh
Ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo-ooh
Ooh-hoo-ooh

Ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo-ooh
Ooh-hoo-ooh
You and I, there's air in between
Ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo-ooh
Ooh-hoo-ooh
You and I, there's air in between
