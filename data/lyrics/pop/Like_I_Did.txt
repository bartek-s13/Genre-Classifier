<<<<<<< HEAD
Lying in this empty bed
I wonder where you lay your head, I
So come on, come on, love
Oh come on, come on, love
I know you said we needed space
But now you're pretty far away, and
So come on, come on, love
Oh come on, come on, love

So don’t say he could ever love you like I, love you like I did
And don't say he could ever treat you better, better than I did
He doesn't know your aching heart
Know your battle scars like I do
Don’t say he could ever love you like I, love you like I did

You say I should've seen the signs
But how am I meant to read your mind?
So come on, come on, love
Oh come on, come on, love

So don't say he could ever love you like I, love you like I did
And don't say he could ever treat you better, better than I did
He doesn't know your aching heart
Know your battle scars like I do
Don't say he could ever love you like I, love you like I did
Oh oh oh
Love you like I, love you like I did
Oh oh oh

But if I'm honest with myself
It ain't so easy now to admit
And maybe all of me, oh every part of me
Just wasn’t what you needed

So I know he will always love you like I, love you like I did
And I know maybe he could treat you better, better than I did
Oh he knows your aching heart
Knows your battle scars like I do
But I know he will always love you like I, love you like I did
