When I talk
Are you hearing me now?
Ain't no words
That could figure it out
Out, out

You know, when we begin a fight
Can't tell when we're wrong or right, no
Got to know, I got to know
If we're in love with our mistakes
Or if we're bending to break now
Come on and tell me the truth

Oh
Are we loving out of order now?
Or was it only in my head, oh
Did our emotions get watered down?
Out of order now

Yeah, we got
A space in-between
Do you want to
But you're too scared to leave?

You know, when we begin a fight
Can't tell when we're wrong or right, no
Got to know, I got to know
If we're in love with our mistakes
Or if we're bending to break now
Come on and tell me the truth

Oh
Are we loving out of order now?
Or was it only in my head, oh
Did our emotions get watered down?
Out of order now
Oh
Out of, out of, out of, out of order
Out of, out of, out of, out of
Out of, out of, out of, out of order
Out of, out of, out of, out of

Oh, yeah, oh
Are we in love with our mistakes
Or are we bending to break now?
Come on and tell me the truth

Oh
Are we loving out of order now?
Or was it only in my head, oh
Did our emotions get watered down?
Out of order now
Oh
Out of, out of, out of, out of order
Out of, out of, out of, out of
Out of, out of, out of, out of order
Out of, out of, out of, out of
