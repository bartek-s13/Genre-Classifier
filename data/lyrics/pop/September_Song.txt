<<<<<<< HEAD
Our love was strong as a lion
Soft as the cotton you lie in
Times we got hot like an iron
You and I
Our hearts had never been broken
We were so innocent darling
We used to talk 'til the morning
You and I

We had that mixtape on every weekend
Had it repeating, had it repeating

You were my September Song, summer lasted too long
Time moves so slowly when you’re only fifteen
You were my September Song, tell me where have you gone
Do you remember me? We were only fifteen
And I, I remember the chorus, they were singing it for us
You were my September song, tell me where have you gone
Do you remember me? We were only fifteen

Sometimes I think that I see your
Face in the strangest of places
Down on the underground station
Passing by
I get a mad sense of danger
Feel like my heart couldn't take it
'Cause if we met we'd be strangers
You and I
Still, I play that mixtape every weekend
Got it repeating, got it repeating

You were my September song, summer lasted too long
Time moves so slowly when you’re only fifteen
You were my September song, tell me where have you gone?
Do you remember me? We were only fifteen
And I, I remember the chorus, they were singing it for us
I hear that September song, that I'm singing along
Thinking about you and me, oh, what a melody

And as the years go by
You will still be my, be my (September song)
You are my (September song)

You were my September song, summer lasted too long
Time moves so slowly when you’re only fifteen
You were my September song, tell me where have you gone
Do you remember me? We were only fifteen
And I, I remember the chorus, they were singing it for us
You were my September song
