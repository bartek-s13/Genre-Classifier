You found me in the darkness
TV screen and you started something with anxiety
Something that you could not see
I was hoping that you’d feel for me

You caught me off guard and you came through

Hit me like a wave but it felt like a flood
I wish I felt more safe (More safe)
Everything changed when you opened up
My love, my love
I like it when you stay, when you show up
I wish I felt more safe (More safe)
I like it when you say my name
My love, my love

You kept me in the darkness
Movie screen when we parted, nothing left inside of me
Empty space where you had been
You were loyal to your secrecy

You caught me off guard and you came through
Hit me like a wave but it felt like a flood
I wish I felt more safe (More safe)
Everything changed when you opened up
My love, my love
I like it when you stay, when you show up
I wish I felt more safe (More safe)
I like it when you say my name
My love, my love

I trusted you
You hid the truth
And led me to thinking we were forever
I trusted you
You hid the truth
And led me to thinking that we were forever

Hit me like a wave but it felt like a flood
I wish I felt more safe
