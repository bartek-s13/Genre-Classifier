I've got shackles round my feet, they tie me to this place
They won't loosen up for love or money, or anything that's in between
They're telling me I'm not allowed to leave
You kept telling me that I should pack up just in case
'Cause you thought that I had better things in store
I couldn't do as I was told, so I told you I didn't love you anymore

But somehow you saw through it all
And you took out all the dark thoughts that I think
Now you don't return any of my calls
So I guess your heart was a one time thing

I wish I could take my time
And show you that I'll be fine
'Cause I would be nothing without you
Nothing without you

A couple hours into this long 13 hour drive
Its just me with the lights off and I think
I should've done better by you
Now I can feel the shackles burn their way into my skin
When I turn around and try to run away from all the dark thoughts
Cause now I have nothing to prove and no one to lose

And next time I'll do better
Cause if I make the same mistakes again

I wish I could take my time
And show you that I'll be fine
'Cause I would be nothing without you
Nothing without you
If I had the chance to say
"I'm sorry for how things changed,"
'Cause I would be nothing without you
Nothing without you

And you shaped me into who I wanted to be
And you made me take a look at myself and see

I wish I could take my time
And show you that I'll be fine;
Just think about how happy you could be
If I had the chance to say
"I'm sorry for how I changed,"
'Cause I would be nothing without you
Nothing without you
