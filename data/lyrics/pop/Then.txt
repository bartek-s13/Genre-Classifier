We had it good, you know
I spent like six years makin' sure you came home to love
You had it good, you know
I stood by your side
I spent up so much time tryna make you happy
I don't think you ever could be happy

Maybe you should try some therapy
Maybe you should lose a couple home boys
Give up on the homegrown
Look at me
'Cause I need you to understand

Now, when you think of late nights with me there in your bed
True ride or die, that's what you had
I loved you, I loved you, I loved you
And when you think of my body on yours, don't forget
Once I would've died for you, baby
I loved you, I loved you, I loved you
But that was then, oh
But that was then, ooh

You don't know shit, you know
You act this big man and you think you are in control
But you don't know shit, you know
I stood by your side, and pulled you away from your fire
Again, and again, and again
I shoulda known fire would win

Maybe you should try some therapy
Maybe you should lose a couple homeboys
Give up on the homegrown
Look at me
'Cause I need you to understand

Now, when you think of late nights with me there in your bed
True ride or die, that's what you had
I loved you, I loved you, I loved you
And when you think of my body on yours, don't forget
Once I would've died for you, baby
I loved you, I loved you, I loved you
But that was then
That was then

You're gonna miss me
You're really gonna miss me
You're gonna miss me
You're gonna miss me
You're gonna miss me
You're really gonna miss me, ah
You're gonna miss me
You're really gonna miss me
You're gonna miss me
You're gonna miss me
You're gonna miss me
You're really gonna miss me

Now, when you think of late nights with me there in your bed
True ride or die, that's what you had
I loved you, I loved you, I loved you
And when you think of my body on yours, don't forget
Once I would've died for you, baby
I loved you, I loved you, I loved you
But that was then
But that was then
But that was then
