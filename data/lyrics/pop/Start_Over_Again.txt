Don't you hang up on me
I know you probably think I'm mad, oh no
But I haven't been to sleep
Thinking of ways to get you back, oh no

And I wonder, if I'm in trouble with your older brother
I don't think you even kept my number
If only we could do it all again, oh no

I wouldn't spill that drink on your dress, wouldn't be so late
I would've paid the bill instead of splitting it two ways
Would've told you, "You look beautiful" instead of, "You look nice"
Girl, I couldn't be more stupid even if I tried
Oh, I wish we could start over again

I bet you told your friends
It was the worst night of your life, oh yeah
And I wish I could pretend
But we both know you're probably right, oh yeah

And if I'm honest, a second date with you is all I wanted
I just hope I haven't gone and blown it
If only we could do this all again, oh yeah
I wouldn't spill that drink on your dress, wouldn't be so late
I would've paid the bill instead of splitting it two ways
Would've told you, "You look beautiful" instead of, "You look nice"
Girl, I couldn't be more stupid even if I tried
I wouldn't spill that drink on your dress, wouldn't be so late
