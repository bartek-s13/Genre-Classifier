Oh, I could take the weight of, the world on my shoulders
The weight of, woah

I could take the weight of, the world on
Yeah, I could take the weight of
I could take the weight of, the world on my shoulders

She said, you better turn the light on
Keeping the dark at bay, woah

Oh, I could take the weight of, the world on my shoulders
The weight of, woah, the world on my shoulders
The weight of, woah

Oh, I could take the weight of, the world on
Yeah, I could take the weight of, woah
