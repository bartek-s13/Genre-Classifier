I see you changing but I still feel the same
Feeling gets stranger but my heart still remains

Don't know where we are going
Don't know where we've come from
Tell me you want me 'fore its all said and done
I've waited to say it, I've waited so long
I've waited to say...

What's it gonna be baby
Cause I don't wanna waste no more time
What's it gonna be baby
I'm chasing all the moments you hide
Cause I don't wanna go
I don't wanna leave you behind
What's it gonna be baby, what's it gonna be

No it's not easy when it's all on the line
You sent me flying from the very first time

Don't know where we are going
Don't know where we've come from
Tell me you want me if I am the one
I've waited to say it, I've waited so long
I've waited to say...
What's it gonna be baby
Cause I don't wanna waste no more time
What's it gonna be baby
I'm chasing all the moments you hide
Cause I don't wanna go
I don't wanna leave you behind
What's it gonna be baby, what's it gonna be

I've waited to say it, I've waited so long
Before the mistakes lets retrace and move on
It's late but I'm yearning to change what went wrong
I've waited to say

What's it gonna be baby
Cause I don't wanna waste no more time
What's it gonna be baby
Been chasing all the moments you hide
Cause I don't wanna go
I don't wanna leave you behind
What's it gonna be baby, what's it gonna be
What's it gonna be baby, what's it gonna be
