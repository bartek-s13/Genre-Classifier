Break through the neon lights
Stay up to talk all night
Sneak in the windowpanes, you call my name
When I'm with you
Feels like fire

Hey, but you feel it too
Inhale and exhale you
It's a little too much for me
Too much too soon
When I'm with you
It feels like fire

Nothing is easy, baby
I wish I could let you in
But inside of me
There's a sign that reads, 'no vacancy'

Flashbacks to hotel rooms
Echoes of me and you
What I wouldn't give to be there one more time
Without you here
Feels like fire

Nothing is easy, baby
I wish I could let you in
But inside of me
There's a sign that reads, 'no vacancy'

Nothing is easy, baby
I wish I could let you in
But inside of me
There's a sign that reads, 'no vacancy'
No vacancy
