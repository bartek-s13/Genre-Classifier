We could be stars out here tonight
Don't go back to reality
Side by side we follow the light
Don't go back to reality
And I'm lost, and I'm lost, and I'm lost on fire
But I know that we both could ignite
We could be stars out here tonight
Don't go back to reality(-ty, -ty, -ty, -ty, -ty....)
We could be stars out here tonight
Don't go back to reality
Side by side we follow the light
Don't go back to reality
And I'm lost, and I'm lost, and I'm lost on fire
But I know that we both could ignite
We could be stars out here tonight
Don't go back to reality(reality, reality)
(reality, reality, reality, reality, reality) x3
(reality, reality, reality, reality)
We could be stars out here tonight
Don't go back to reality
Side by side we follow the light
Don't go back to reality
And I'm lost, and I'm lost, and I'm lost on fire
But I know that we both could ignite
We could be stars out here tonight
Don't go back to reality(-ty, -ty, -ty, -ty, -ty....)
We could be stars out here tonight
Don't go back to reality
Side by side we follow the light
Don't go back to reality
And I'm lost, and I'm lost, and I'm lost on fire
But I know that we both could ignite
We could be stars out here tonight
Don't go back to reality(reality, reality)
(reality, reality, reality, reality, reality) x2
We could be stars out here tonight
Don't go back to reality
