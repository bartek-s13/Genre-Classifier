<<<<<<< HEAD
I'm up all night
Thinking about how u love me
How u touch me
How u acted like no one above me
This ain't right
U been on some other shit like
Drinking all night
Thinking u should be with me instead right

U keep going through your phases
I keep running out of patience
You've been different and I hate it
So I'm asking u to

Tell me u still want me
U know that I've been fucking lonely, alone
So tell me u still want me
U know that I've been spending way too many nights without u, yeah

I'm up all night
Losing sleep on words u tell me
It's unhealthy
I keep buying all the lies u sell me
This ain't right, telling me u never felt it
Yeah, I'm helpless
Texts u send when u like being selfish

U keep going through your phases
I keep running out of patience
You've been different and I hate it
So I'm asking u to

Tell me u still want me
U know that I've been fucking lonely, alone
So tell me u still want me
U know that I've been spending way too many nights without u, yeah

I swear u got the worst of me
Why u gotta say it like that
Don't u know you're hurting me
I always say I love u right back
Well u know it's true
I made mistakes and I lied to u
We took a break when I stayed in school
I still don't know that side of u
Even when I wanted thrills
U keep hitting all my feels
I don't see a way to chill
I'm not over u still

Tell me u still want me
U know that I've been fucking lonely, alone
So tell me u still want me
U know that I've been spending way too many nights without u, yeah

I swear u got the worst of me
Why u gotta say it like that
Don't u know you're hurting me
