You like playing with pins and needles
You like knowing that I need you
You must be practicing some evil
'Cause I'm falling for ya
And I don't even know ya

I'm not feeling too well
Can't you tell?
Stuck under your spell
I'm not really myself
Could use some help

You got me sick and I'm crawling
Baby, what did you do?
I'm such a mess, can't stop falling
This ain't what I'm used to
It must be voodoo, voodoo
Voodoo, voodoo

Girl, you treat me like a puppet
You pull my strings when you want something
And though I know I still come running
'Cause I'm falling for ya
You know I adore ya

I'm not feeling too well
Can't you tell?
Stuck under your spell
I'm not really myself
Could use some help

You got me sick and I'm crawling
Baby, what did you do?
I'm such a mess, can't stop falling
This ain't what I'm used to
It must be voodoo, voodoo
Voodoo, voodoo

'Cause I see your face everywhere that I visit
If you're a wiccan can I be a wizard?
Holding your crystals and playing with dolls
Ooo, how can I get involved?
Damn your a temptress with devilish might
A black magic woman, Santana was right
Burning your sage, is it all just a trick?

You got me sick and I'm crawling
Baby, what did you do?
I'm such a mess, can't stop falling
This ain't what I'm used to
It must be voodoo, voodoo
Voodoo, voodoo
You got me sick and I'm crawling
Baby, what did you do?
I'm such a mess, can't stop falling
This ain't what I'm used to
It must be voodoo, voodoo
Voodoo, voodoo
