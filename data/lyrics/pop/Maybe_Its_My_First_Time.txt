Oh my god
My heart it hurts now
Didn't know it till it tipped me upside down
Well, why am I confused then?
I'm feeling nervous
Feeling I've got the right one
Maybe it's my first time
I know these things they happen all the time
It's my first time
Wearing all the shit that I bought you
Oh, oh
I've got a list so long it could hurt you
Oh, oh

And oh my god
I'll be cruising off this last time
And oh my god
I'll be cruising off this last
You say that you want it, you do it, you want it
Oh, I stand up to see that
Oh, I stand up to see that

Superstitious folk wouldn't ask me back again
I'm just bad news to them
I offended them with my sickness and my weakness
I'm just bad news to them

And oh my god
I'll be cruising off this last time
And oh my god
I'll be cruising off this last
You say that you want it, you do it, you want it
Oh, I stand up to see that
Oh, I stand up to see that

I only look back once, try it again
I only look back once, try it again
Try it again
I only look back once, try it again
I only look back once, try it again
Try it again
Try it again
Oh, oh, oh
I know these things they happen all the time
It's my first time
Mmm
