More in like than I've ever been
The sweetest summer that I've ever seen
It's funny now that we were only sixteen
And though we've turned many pages by
I'll admit on occasion, I
Wonder how you've been doing since me

And I've heard from everybody else
That you're so much better without me
'Cause remember
That your friends are my friends

But you don't have to be a...
You say you're flying now I'm gone
Don't care about me no more
You think I'm crying, well, I'm not
I've never been quite this sure
But I don't wanna hear another word
'Cause I'm still a little hurt
So you can live without it
But you don't have to be a bitch about it

You don't have to be a...
But you don't have to be a...
You don't have to be a bitch about it

I saw you've moved to the city now
Got it all figured out
Went and got a boyfriend
Wouldn't your mother be proud (proud)
But you don't have to be a...
But still I wonder if you're ever bored
Of keeping score and measured pours
'Cause that don't sound like fun to me

And I've heard
You're done with being young
And you swear those days are behind you
But remember that I know you better

You don't have to be a...
You say you're flying now I'm gone
Don't care about me no more
You think I'm crying, well, I'm not
I've never been quite this sure
But I don't wanna hear another word
'Cause I'm still a little hurt
So you can live without it
But you don't have to be a bitch about it

You don't have to be a...
I'm kinda glad we didn't end it badly
'Cause you and I were never meant work it out
You don't have to be a...
You know I really wanna see you happy
But you don't have to be a...
No, you don't have to be a... hmm
No, no, no

You don't have to be a...
You say you're flying now I'm gone
Don't care about me no more
You think I'm crying, well, I'm not
I've never been quite this sure
But I don't wanna hear another word
'Cause I'm still a little hurt
So you can live without it
But you don't have to be a...
You say you're flying now I'm gone
Don't care about me no more
You think I'm crying, well, I'm not
I've never been quite this sure
But I don't wanna hear another word
'Cause I'm still a little hurt
So you can live without it
But you don't have to be a bitch about it
