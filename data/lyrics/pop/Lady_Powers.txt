Lady, lady, lady, lady powers
Lady, lady, lady, lady powers

I thought that you said you'd buy me flowers
So you had me waiting here for hours
Empty handed, took for granted
My lady, lady, lady, lady powers
I thought that you said you'd take me dancing
Nothing special, just a touch of romancing
I can't stand it, how you take for granted
My lady, lady, lady, lady powers

I'm not gonna beg for your respect
I won't be defined by your eyes
You can refuse, I shouldn't have to use

My lady, lady, lady, lady powers
Lady, lady, lady, lady powers

I know that you think I'm going crazy
But I'm not gonna settle for anything short of amazing
Couple billion on the earth
Don't you think I deserve someone who puts me first?

I'm not gonna beg for your respect
I won't be defined by your eyes
Beauty and lies, unsatisfied
All the things we do for your kind
You can refuse, but I shouldn't have to use

My lady, lady, lady, lady powers
Lady, lady, lady, lady powers
Lady, lady, lady, lady powers
Lady, lady, lady, lady powers

And I could bare my body and my bones, mmm
But that would only tear me from my throne, hmmm

My lady, lady, lady, lady powers
Lady, lady, lady, lady powers
Lady, lady, lady, lady powers
Lady, lady, lady, lady powers
