Sometimes, the feeling is right
You fall in love for the first time
Heartbeat, and kisses so sweet
Summer time love in the moonlight
Now the summer is gone, you have to go back home
Please come and see me again, I never felt more alone
Baby, I'm missing you
I want you by my side
And I hope you miss me too
Come back and stay
I think about you every day
I really want you too
You swept my feet right off the ground, you're the love I found
Doctor Jones, Jones
Calling Doctor Jones
Doctor Jones, Doctor Jones
Get up now
Wake up now
Doctor Jones, Jones
Calling Doctor Jones
Doctor Jones, Doctor Jones
Wake up now
Wake up now
All I think of is you
And all of the things we had
Doctor, what can I do?
Why does it have to be like that?
Baby, I'm missing you
I want you by my side
And I hope you'll miss me too
Come back and stay
I think about you every day
I really want you to
You swept my feet right off the ground, you're the love I found
Doctor Jones, Jones
Calling Doctor Jones
Doctor Jones, Doctor Jones
Get up now
Wake up now
Doctor Jones, Jones
Calling Doctor Jones
Doctor Jones, Doctor Jones
Wake up now
Wake up now
Please, please, cure me
Please, please, cure me
Please, please, cure me
Please, please, cure me
Doctor Jones, Jones
Wake up now
Doctor Jones, Jones
Wake up now
Doctor Jones, Jones
Wake up now
Doctor Jones, Jones
Wake up now
Doctor Jones, Jones
Calling Doctor Jones
Doctor Jones, Doctor Jones
Get up now
Wake up now
Doctor Jones, Jones
Calling Doctor Jones
Doctor Jones, Doctor Jones
