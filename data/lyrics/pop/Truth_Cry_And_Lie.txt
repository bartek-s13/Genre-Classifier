A red rose cheeks
A drop of tear to weep
Reminds me of you
A long side a sigh
A long side of cry
A soft summer rain
A smile that hides a pain
Why should you be ashamed
'Cause in every life a little rain must fall
And you are my friend
Charmingly sentimental brain
There's a truth behind a cry
And there's a cry behind a lie
On every words that came out strong
Just let them go and let's get along
On every grudge and every fight
I miss you all day and night
Have you had your time off today
To drink a cup of tea and smile away
Sometimes I wonder will I ever see you
Without all your game plan
When all you have is nothing but a pure bliss
I will wait that day
When you can find your way
Out of this maze of love
And you can laugh to see cries and lies
'Cause you know better than me
Only the truth will set you free
There's a truth behind a cry
And there's a cry behind a lie
On every thought that came out wrong
Just learn from it and please stay strong
On every grudge and every fight
I miss you all day and night
It's not easy to understand
But you must hold on your stand
I know you know
You know I know
There's a truth behind a cry
And there's a cry behind a lie
On every thought that came out wrong
Just learn from it and please stay strong
On every grudge and every fight
I miss you all day and night
It's not easy to understand
But you must hold on your stand
There's a truth behind a cry
There's a cry behind a lie
There's a hope on every fright
