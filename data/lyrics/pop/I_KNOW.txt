Hit me up when you with them
Been around trying to lay low
Now I'm back here 
W steel no time
I've been on your mind
Forget about here baby
Just for one night baby

I know you got a plan
So what so what
It's me and the fam'
Like what like what
I just wanna feel your love your love
Yeah I just wanna feel your love your love
I know you got a plan
So what so what
It' me and the fam'
Like what like what
For a moment we can forget what's right
I know you feel me i know

I know you feel me i know
I know you feel me i know
I know you feel me i know
I know you feel me i know

Forget about all of your problems
I can lend a hand out on helping you solve them
I can see you feeling so right when it's so wrong
You seem a little keen tell me where do we go from here
I'm a little unclear
I don't wanna be getting the wrong idea
I just wanna hear you say it's right
Then give me the okay to run away for the night girl
We can do it on the down low
You don't want the reputation of getting around so
We can keep it all low key and sleep on the insecurities
A little secret keep it between you and me
Forget all of this shit that you go through
And do a couple of things we ain't supposed to
Like kicking back just doing this and that
With no strings attached

I know you got a plan
So what so what
It's me and the fam'
Like what like what
I just wanna feel your love your love
Yeah I just wanna feel your love your love
I know you got a plan
So what so what
It' me and the fam'
Like what like what
For a moment we can forget what's right
I know you feel me i know

I know you feel me i know
I know you feel me i know
I know you feel me i know
I know you feel me i know

I know you got a plan
So what so what
It's me and the fam'
Like what like what
I just wanna feel your love your love
Yeah I just wanna feel your love your love
I know you got a plan
So what so what
It' me and the fam'
Like what like what
For a moment we can forget what's right
I know you feel me i know

We can keep it all low key
And you can blame it all on me
It's hard to believe that you're all I see
Straight to the heart and the more 
So would you stay for a while
I just wanna see you smile
I don't want bullshit that really ain't my style
I just wanna see you light up yeah

I know you got a plan
So what so what
It's me and the fam'
Like what like what
I just wanna feel your love your love
Yeah I just wanna feel your love your love
I know you got a plan
So what so what
It' me and the fam'
Like what like what
For a moment we can forget what's right
I know you feel me i know
