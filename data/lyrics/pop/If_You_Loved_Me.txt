<<<<<<< HEAD
Can we stop and just get real?
This is messing with my head again
You're not sure of how you feel
If you loved me, you would know if you loved me
Keep tryna convince myself
Maybe you just need a little time
I should by now that won’t help
If you loved me, you would know if you loved me

If you loved me, you would know
If you loved me, you would know
If you loved me, if you loved me
If you loved me, you'd be sure
If you loved me, you would know
If you loved me, if you loved me

Silence is the loudest sound
You never say where your head is at
When I'm in love, I scream it out
If you loved me, you would know if you loved me
Hope but still I try
Try to get us through this
Hope that even that don’t
But my own excuses
And I don't know why
‘Cause I know it's useless
Yeah, I realise
If you loved me, you would know
If you loved me, you would know
If you loved me, if you loved me
If you loved me, you'd be sure
If you loved me, you would know
If you loved me, if you loved me
If you loved me, you would know
If you loved me, you would know
If you loved me, if you loved me
If you loved me, you'd be sure
If you loved me, you would know
If you loved me, if you loved me

Oh, hope but still I try (Oh-oh-oh)
Try to get us through this
If you loved
Hope but still I try
Try to get us through this
(Ooh)
Oh

Can we stop and just get real?
