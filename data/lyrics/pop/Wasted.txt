I like us better when we're wasted
It makes it easier to fake it
The only time we really talk
Is when our clothes are coming off
I like us better when we're wasted
It makes it easier to say it
Lay all your laundry on the bed
And then I'll lay it in instead
I like us better when we're wasted
Ohhh ohh ohh oh oh

You are my glass half empty
Sipping my ocean dry
Emotionally spin me
'Till none of our planets could align
But I could stand you one more night

I like us better when we're wasted
It makes it easier to say it
Lay all your laundry on the bed
And then I'll lay in it instead
I like us better when we're wasted
Ohhh ohh ohh oh oh

You are a catch-22, either way I miss out
All of the grief I give you
Is energy I can live without
But I could stand you one more night

I like us better when we're wasted
It makes it easier to say it
Lay all your laundry on the bed
And then I'll lay in it instead
I like us better when we're wasted
Ohhh ohh ohh oh oh

I like us better when we're wasted
It makes it easier to say it
Lay all your laundry on the bed
And then I'll lay in it instead
I like us better when we're wasted
Ohhh ohh ohh oh oh
Ohhh ohh ohh oh oh
