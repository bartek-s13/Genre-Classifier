I'm a bad girlfriend
I'm a bad girlfriend
(Huh)

You cancel plans for me, I cancel ours on you
Say I'd be back early, I don't get in 'til 2
You ask me where I've been, I tell you something vague
Think I messed up again, what can I say?

Your mum said that she hates me, thinks I'm fucking lazy
Your friends keep on telling you to leave me 'cause I'm crazy
I do some shit you can't forgive
But you better get used to it

I'm a bad girlfriend, I'm a bad girlfriend
You tell me your birthday, I forgot again
I'm a bad girlfriend, I'm a bad girlfriend
I can see you calling, I'm not answering
I'm laughing but I don't think that you're funny
I'm staying 'cause you give me all your money
I'm a bad girlfriend
I'm a bad girlfriend (friend)
Huh, yeah

I'm a, I'm a, I'm a
I'm a bad bad girl
I'm a, I'm a
I'm a bad bad girl, girlfriend (haha)
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a
I'm a bad bad girl
I'm a, I'm a
I'm a bad bad girl, girlfriend, yeah

You make me dinner then, I order take-away
You wanna meet my friends, I say another day
You trust me with your keys and I fuck up your car
You're gonna stay with me, I break your heart

'Cause I'm one in a million, more like in a billion
I don't think it's cheating if I'm kissing other women
I do some shit you can't forgive
And you better get used to it

I'm a bad girlfriend, I'm a bad girlfriend
You tell me your birthday, I forgot again
I'm a bad girlfriend, I'm a bad girlfriend
I can see you calling, I'm not answering
I'm laughing but I don't think that you're funny
I'm staying 'cause you give me all your money
I'm a bad girlfriend
I'm a bad girlfriend (friend), huh, yeah, woo

I'm a bad bad girl, girlfriend

You should be with someone who's
Always gonna wake up with you
Always gonna tell you the truth
And not lie to you like I do
You should be with someone else
Someone who is not myself
You know I'm not good for your health
And everyone else can tell
I'm a bad girlfriend, yeah

I'm a, I'm a, I'm a
I'm a bad bad girl (haha, y'all)
I'm a, I'm a
I'm a bad bad girl, girlfriend (but you already knew that)
