<<<<<<< HEAD
My head is in the ceiling while my body's laying on the floor
Never turning back you got me feeling like I’ve never felt before
Leaving early even when I know they gonna stay up late
I don't even care if it is raining when I know you're there to wait
You got me

So good I feel your body on my fingertips
I’m never letting you go

I wanna stay up, stay in, under your skin
We'll never die, we'll never die
You got me
I wanna move slow just so that you don't go
I want you to be by my side
You got me

Never been so warm inside, I've never been so terrified
I can get so happy I could fall down from the sky and start to cry
You got me
So helpless but I'd rather stay
Boy, nothing else can get in my way
No car, no train, no tube, no plane
Cause you got me
So good I feel your body on my fingertips
I'm never letting you go

I wanna stay up, stay in, under your skin
We'll never die, we’ll never die
You got me
I wanna move slow just so that you don’t go
I want you to be by my side
You got me
I wanna stay up all night, yeah
I wanna stay up, stay in, under your skin
We'll never die, we’ll never die
We'll never die, no no
You got me
I wanna move slow just so that you don't go
I want you to be by my side
