Yeah, yeah

We could go solo
We could go solo but I wouldn't like to
No, I wouldn’t like to, nah
Yeah, although you've heard things
Yeah, I know you've heard things, I wouldn’t lie, no
No, I'll never lie to you
So I keep saying

Honestly, just believe that's not me
You're making me feel like I'm evil (ooh-ooh-ooh)
Trust in me, nobody but you and me
Gotta hold off yourself and just listen

You got me feeling like you're breaking up
Rumors all around and you pick 'em up
Like you'd know, like you’d know
Eleven I was dead and yet we’re making out
Everything we are becomes a question mark
I'm so lost, I’m so lost (yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)

Drunk on the dancefloor
Got lost in your rhythm, oh, my obsession
You became my obsession, yeah
But babe, all this drama
Keeps on making it harder though you're my blessing
I hope you're getting the message

Honestly, just believe, that's not me
You’re making me feel like I'm evil

You got me feeling like you're breaking up
Rumors all around and you pick 'em up
Like you'd know, like you'd know
Eleven I was dead and yet we're making out
Everything we are becomes a question mark
I'm so lost, I'm so lost

Honestly, just believe, that's not me
You're making me feel like I'm evil (making me feel like I'm evil)
Trust in me, nobody but you and me
Gotta hold off yourself and just listen

You got me feeling like you're breaking up
Rumors all around and you pick 'em up
Like you'd know, like you'd know
Eleven I was dead and yet we're making out
Everything we are becomes a question mark
