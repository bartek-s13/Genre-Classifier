So quiet I can't define
What's swimming inside my mind
I've been here before my darling
No worries when I'm with you
No raindrops within my view
I've been here before my darling

And now that you're mine
I'll be there on time
You'll be on my mind

Still dancing with my sweetest heart
Romancing in a distant park
We've been here before my darling

And now that you're mine
I'll be there on time
You'll be on my mind
