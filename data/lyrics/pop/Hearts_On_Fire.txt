Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Strangers in my head keep making me forget
Where I came from, where I came from
There’s madness in our eyes, we're too blind to realize
Just what we’ve done, just what we’ve done

I feel it taking a hold
I feel a rush in my bones to you
I think we’re caught in a fight
Can we make it alright
With all these shadows on our backs?
How can we take it back? And

How can we love with our hearts on fire?
Is this enough or are we just burning
Ashes to dust like a funeral pyre?
Can we love with our hearts on fire?
How can we love with our hearts on fire?

Alone between the sheets, down on these dirty streets
I lost my soul, I lost my soul
Such a losing game again, between angels and demons
And I feel cold, I feel cold

I think we’re caught in a fight
Can we make it alright
With all these shadows on our backs?
How can we take it back?

How can we love with our hearts on fire?
Is this enough or are we just burning
Ashes to dust like a funeral pyre?
Can we love with our hearts on fire?
How can we love with our hearts on fire?
How can we love with our hearts on fire?
Is this enough or can we go higher?
How can we love with our hearts on fire?
How can we love with our hearts on fire?
How can we love with our hearts on fire?
Is this enough or are we just burning
Ashes to dust like a funeral pyre?
Can we love with our hearts on fire?

How can we talk and the words just won't come out?
Too scared to open up our mouths
Will we walk as the flames get higher?
How can we love with our hearts on fire?
