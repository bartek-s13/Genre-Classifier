We will be a work of art
A monument in every park
You'll love me forever
At least another thousand years
Millenniums without a tear
'Cause we'll be together

How did I find you?

You're upside down, I'm inside out
We're opposite, crazy but we just make sense
You're out of sight, I fall behind
We're opposite, crazy but we just make sense

You'll go down in history
No one else made sense of me
You know me by heart
Legends for the rest of time
Your name resting next to mine
Never apart

How did I find you?
You're upside down, I'm inside out
We're opposite, crazy but we just make sense
You're out of sight, I fall behind
We're opposite, crazy but we just make sense

How did I find you?
How did I find you?
How did I find you?
