Here we stand, til the end
When all the leaves have fallen
I know that it’s only you I can depend
So you said
Remember all you said
But how you try to hide
How you’ve changed inside
From all the colour, all the colour
You see a darkness shines

Now I’ve gone, I’m undone
And far away from valleys that will keep me in the darkness of your sun
But I can’t, help but want you
Why you try to hide
How you’ve changed inside
From all the colour, all the colour
