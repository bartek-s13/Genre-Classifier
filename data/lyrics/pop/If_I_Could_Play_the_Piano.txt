If I could play the piano
I would write you a song
I'm a nice fellow
We could all get along
And impress all your friends
And your family
I'd impress all your friends
And your family

But It turns out
I don't know
That much about anything
At all
That much about anything
At all

If I could play the piano
I would write you a song
And I can teach you
We can play along
We could be in a band
And travel the country
We could live in a van
Maybe just you and me
But It turns out
I don't know
That much about anything
At all
That much about anything
At all
That much about anything
At all
That much about anything
