I drown in the oceans
That keep us apart
Mapping distant stars
Oh their voices call me
To the shelter of your skin
Where the end begins

Oh I'm fading through
Oh I'm fading through
Nothing left to do
And can't you see it was all for you?

I'd climb on rooftops
To catch a glimpse of the moon
A fading trail of you
A mountain of effort
And a wall of prayer
But this war is to the death

Oh we're fading through
Oh we're fading through
Nothing left to do
And can't you see it was all for you?

Oh we're fading through
Oh we're fading through
Nothing left to do
And can't you see it was all for you?

Can you make this new?
Can you make this new?
Body crumbles to dust
But I can't lose you
