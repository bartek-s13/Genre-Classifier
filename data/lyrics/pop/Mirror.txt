I can't stop looking in the mirror
Do I really make that face?
Can you remind me what I look like?
Now I'm alone in my own place

Heal me, heal me, heal me, heal me
Heal me, heal me, heal me, heal me
(Heal me, heal me, heal me, heal me)
You chose to leave, you chose to leave, you chose to leave

I keep looking in the mirror
'Til I see myself, I see myself, eh
Hey lover, will you blow my cover?
'Cause I'm not myself, I'm not myself, I
Wake up in the middle of the night
And I look like a stranger in the bathroom light, I
I keep looking in the mirror 'til I see myself

I'm trying so hard to forget you
When were you last online?
I should pretend I never met you
I'm still so desperate all the time

Do I really laugh like that?
(Heal me, heal me, heal me, heal me)
Do I speak? Do I move? Do I look like that?
(Heal me, heal me, heal me, heal me)
I can't remember what I'm good at
(Heal me, heal me, heal me, heal me)
Where you at? Where you at?
(Heal me, heal me, heal me, heal me)
Where you at?
(Heal me, heal me, heal me, heal me)

I keep looking in the mirror
'Til I see myself, I see myself, eh
Hey lover, will you blow my cover?
'Cause I'm not myself, I'm not myself, I
Wake up in the middle of the night
And I look like a stranger in the bathroom light, I
I keep looking in the mirror 'til I see myself

People love, people leave, people let down
People show up, roll up, people grow up
People move out, people disappear
People don't change, people rearrange
People miss the game, people lose
People try, people lie, can't look you in the eye
People suck, people fuck, people leave their shit behind
People throw up on the carpet, people trip up on the stairs
People laugh, people dare, people scare, people tell you what to wear
People jump, people sink, people float, people think
People fail, people hate what they don't know
People think they're worth nothing, people think they're at the top
People drop, people love what they know, people think but don't stop

I keep looking in the mirror
'Til I see myself, I see myself, eh
Hey lover, will you blow my cover?
'Cause I'm not myself, I'm not myself, I
Wake up in the middle of the night
And I look like a stranger in the bathroom light, I
I keep looking in the mirror 'til I see myself, I see myself, eh
I keep looking in the mirror
'Til I see myself, I see myself, eh
Hey lover, will you blow my cover?
'Cause I'm not myself, I'm not myself, I
Wake up in the middle of the night
And I look like a stranger in the bathroom light, I
I keep looking in the mirror 'til I see myself, I see myself, eh
