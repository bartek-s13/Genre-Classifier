Way up
Going away, gonna fade, let me charge my phone
Roll away on a wave, yeah, we hit the road
'Cause tonight we gon' let go for a week or so
We got all the shit we need
We're on 10 everyday, it ain't nothing new
Iced tea, lemonade for me and the crew
Blow the night away, shoot us to the moon
Catch us at the drive-thru

Ay ay, and my mama don't know what I need, need
But my daddy left me with the keys, keys
So goddamn, I'm ballin' like the man
I'm sittin' shotgun in a six-wheel van

We're on the way, though, in a Winnebago
We'll reserve you a table and some jumper cables

Fuck it
Alright, alright, alright, alright, I'm goin' in
All night, all night, I'm goin' in
All night, all night, I'm goin' in
All night, all night, I'm goin', I'm go-go
Alright, I'm goin' in
All night, all night, I'm goin' in
All night, all night, I'm goin' in
All night, all night, I'm goin', I'm go-go
Yeah yeah yeah
Putting gas in the tank got me acting rude
Mary Jane in the back 'cause she in the mood
We ain't got a plan, that shit hit the fan
Ain't nobody having fun like we do

Ay ay, and my mama don't know what I need, need
But my daddy left me with the keys, keys
So goddamn, I'm ballin' like the man
I'm sittin' shotgun in a six-wheel van

We're on the way, though, in a Winnebago
We'll reserve you a table and some jumper cables

Fuck it
Alright, alright, alright, alright, I'm goin' in
All night, all night, I'm goin' in
All night, all night, I'm goin' in
All night, all night, I'm goin', I'm go-go
Alright, I'm goin' in
All night, all night, I'm goin' in
All night, all night, I'm goin' in
All night, all night, I'm goin'
Ay ay, and my mama don't know what I need, need
But my daddy left me with the keys, keys
So goddamn, I'm ballin' like the man
I'm sittin' shotgun in a six-wheel van

We're on the way, though, in a Winnebago
(We're on our way, yeah, Winnebago)
We'll reserve you a table and some jumper cables
(Won't scratch the seats or she'll kill me)
We're on the way, though, in a Winnebago
(Yeah, we're on our way, so don't delay)
We'll reserve you a table and some jumper cables
(Reserve you a table, oh yeah)
