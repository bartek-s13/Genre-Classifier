Coal and flame
Melting those ice hands
An air of mixed feelings
Beneath fallen ceilings
Seal the gates
Before what's out is in
Or offer a treaty
A chance for reprieve
Just let these tunnels cave
Just let this fire fade
Maybe the sky'll break
We're just a lie away
From proving to ourselves we're not afraid
And now
These silver screens, these scripted dreams
And now
We're suddenly
Fates latest casualties
Fates latest casualties
Fates latest casualties
