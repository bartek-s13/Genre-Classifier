With iT
I become the death Dickinson feared
With iT
I'm a red admiral on this ship
And I raise
With infants for my coronation
I rule
Over my all my dead impersonations

'Cause I've got it
I'm a man now
I've got it
I'm a man now
And I won't let you steal it, I bought it for myself
I'm a man now (She lies, she lies)

I hit
The bird-dogs who are pulling my hair
Because
Their teeth should ravage a golden beard
I've lost
Some eyeless friends whose blood runs cold
My new people
On silent heels pretends to be old
'Cause I won
I'm a man now
'Cause I've got it
I am a man now
And I won't let you steal it, I bought it for myself
I'm a man now (She lies, she lies)
Oh lord!

She wants to be a man, a man
But she lies
She wants to be born again, again
But she'll lose
She draws her own crotch by herself
But she'll lose
Because it's a fake
It's a fake, it's a fake, it's a fake

No! I've got it
I'm a man now
Yes, I've got it
I am a man now
And there's nothing you can do to make me change my mind
I'm a man now (She lies, she lies)
Oh lord!
She's a man now
She's a man now
And there's nothing we can do to make her change her mind
She's a man now
She's a man now
She's a man now
And there's nothing we can do to make her change her mind
She's a man now
She's a man now
She's a man now
And there's nothing we can do to make her change her mind
