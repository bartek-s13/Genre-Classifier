You’ve been watching me for a while now
This is just a game, not a phase that will fade out
Took too much, my mistake, replicate with somebody else
I know what you want but all I wanted was to lose you
You drive me crazy, not the crazy that you want to
If you can’t see through the screen then follow me
And I’ll show you hell

Why you always talking when you’ve got nothing to say?
I know it must be hard for you, not to scream my name

Why is there a storm on the long way up?
I never really healed when it got too much
It took a thousand lies ‘til I’d had enough of you, you
And it feels like wasted youth

I’ve been treading on coals for a long time
Girl you’ve got me breathing fire like it's a lifeline
Pain is deep and I’m weak, lack of sleep ain't no medicine

Why you always talking when you’ve got nothing to say?
I know it must be hard for you, not to scream my name
Why is there a storm on the long way up?
I never really healed when it got too much
It took a thousand lies ‘til I’d had enough of you
And it feels like wasted youth

Youth
Youth
And I’m running out of time
And I’m running out of time

Why is there a storm on the long way up?
I never really healed when it got too much
It took a thousand lies ‘til I’d had enough of you, you
Why is there a storm on the long way up?
I never really healed when it got too much
It took a thousand lies ‘til I’d had enough of you, you
And it feels like wasted youth

And it feels like wasted youth
And it feels like wasted youth
And it feels like wasted youth
And it feels like wasted youth
And it feels like wasted youth
