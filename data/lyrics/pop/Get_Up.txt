Hide at the back like a child, like it's all that you know
Twist all your lies like you're running with your eyes closed
Step to the truth take a bow, this is all you
Rip off your skin sew me in, be your new disguise
Pull on my veins are you trying to say
Get up, get up now
Falling like you used to
Falling through change in the loneliest way get up
Get up now, hold me like you used to
Hold up your chest bag, your clothes, like it's all that you know
Rush for the door racing home with your eyes closed
Step to the truth take a bow, this is all you
Rip off your skin sew me in, be your new disguise
Pull on my veins are you trying to say
Get up, get up now
Falling like you used to
Falling through change in the loneliest way get up
Get up now, hold me like you used to
Hold on, call it off or leave it
It figures, I’m the one to, but you’re the one who
Needs it, so call it off off or leave it
It figures, I'm the one to, we just need to
Hold on, call it off or leave it
It figures, I’m the one to, but you’re the one who
Needs it, so call it off off or leave it
It figures, I'm the one to, we just need to get up
