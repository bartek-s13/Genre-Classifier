Hey
Take me to your home (oh)
Pray
Take me where you're whole (oh)

Arms around my head won't rest
So I, close my eyes instead
Harm around my head won't rest, I dread
So I, close my eyes instead

Blue
I want lots of you (ooh)
Oh, can't you see I've grown? (grew)

Arms around my head won't rest
So I close my eyes instead
Harm around my head won't rest, I dread
So I, close my eyes instead
Arms around my head won't rest
So I close my eyes instead
Harm around my head won't rest, I dread
So I close my eyes instead
