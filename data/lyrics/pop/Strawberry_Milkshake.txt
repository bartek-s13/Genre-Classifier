I really hate my job
It feels like such a drag
You never come to see me anymore
I really need a break
My head's inside a bag
I wish you'd come to see me when I'm feeling blue

Then we could drink strawberry milkshakes by the seaside
Then we could drink strawberry milkshakes by the seaside

I slept in really late
Was dreaming of your face
You never smile around here anymore
I scraped you off my plate
But you still left a trace
I wanna call you but I never see it through

Then we could drink strawberry milkshakes by the seaside
Then we could drink strawberry milkshakes by the seaside
