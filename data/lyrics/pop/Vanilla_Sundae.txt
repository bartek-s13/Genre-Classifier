Sunlight on the bed sheets
Your eyes looking heavy
Shit shows on the telly
But we don't mind, we don't mind at all
Go halves on a whole piece
Sweet taste, strawberry
No need for us to get ready
'Cause we treat time like a waterfall

But now I'm dreading every weekend
Nostalgia giving me the feeling
That I may never find another like you

I just need one more vanilla sundae with you
When we got nothing to do but watch the day go by
So tell me, did you want one more vanilla sundae with me?
Then we can call it history
If that's what you really want

Skies grey in the morning
Eyes red, tears are pouring
Blueberry Monday is calling
So many things that I have to do
It's stormy weather
I can't forget ya
I tried, know that I tried
So aren't you missing all the whispers?
You know you always made me shiver
But now the summer's never felt so cold

I just need one more vanilla sundae with you
When we got nothing to do but watch the day go by
So tell me, did you want one more vanilla sundae with me?
Then we can call it history
If that's what you really want

Let's talk about it
Come, let's talk about it now, girl
I can't live without it
Please don't make me live without it, girl
Don't wanna try another flavour, I want you
'Cause I just need
I just really need one more
(I need, I need)
Sweet vanilla Sunday

I just need one more vanilla sundae with you
When we got nothing to do but watch the day go by
So tell me, did you want one more vanilla sundae with me?
Then we can call it history
