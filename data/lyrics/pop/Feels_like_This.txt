Who cares 'bout star signs?
I知 hardwired to be with you
You're like a sunrise and I'm scared that I値l never get enough of you
Nobody called it a starfall
Come out the blue

I'm all butterflies
I'm sky-high for you

When it feels like this, like a light came on
And you look at me like I'm all you want
I got everything at my fingertips
How can I resist when it feels like this?

Uncover secrets
Treasure hunting days away
Stumbling on diamonds
I'm speechless and blown away
The little things
I'm shivering
The way you hold my hand

I'm all butterflies
I'm sky-high for you

When it feels like this, like a light came on
And you look at me like I知 all you want
I got everything at my fingertips
How can I resist when it feels like this?

Like you were always meant to be
Right here next to me
In your faded denim jeans (when it feels like this)
Like we were always meant to be
To think I never knew it 稚il now

When it feels like this, like a light came on
When you look at me like I'm all you want
I got everything at my fingertips
How can I resist?
When it feels like this, like a light came on
When you look at me, say I知 all you want
I got everything at my fingertips
