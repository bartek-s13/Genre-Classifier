She walks past here every day now
You bet I stare
You bet I stare
She looks at me then she looks away
She doesn't care
She doesn't care
But now I, will let her go
Because she, will never let me know
But now I, will let her go
Because she, will never let me know
She walks past here every day now
You bet I stare
You bet I stare
She looks at me then she looks away
She doesn't care
She doesn't care
