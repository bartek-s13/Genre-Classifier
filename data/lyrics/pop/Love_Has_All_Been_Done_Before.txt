<<<<<<< HEAD
Sick and tired of just lettin' you in
Just to let you down again
Exasperated with the expectation
You'll be more than just a friend
But in honesty that I, I can be
A fourth finger with four limbs to carry
Won't let you make a fool out of me, boy
See boy

You are good and you are pure
The angel knockin' at my door
But I need something, something more
'Cause love has all been done before
And you are sweet and you are nice
Keep me calm and satisfied
But I need something, something more
'Cause love has all been done before

You almost had me for a minute there
Givin' my whole life to this love affair
Well, I'm not gonna sit here and stroke your hair
You almost had me for a minute there
It doesn't help that you mean well
They say the devil's in the detail
And I'm tryin' not to raise hell
But it's lightning 'fore the rain fell
You are good and you are pure
The angel knockin' at my door
But I need something, something more
'Cause love has all been done before
And you are sweet and you are nice
Keep me calm and satisfied
But I need something, something more
'Cause love has all been done before

Everything's a rerun
Before it's even begun
Tell me, what's the reason?
If everything's a season
Then I'm a setting sun
We're already done

You are good and you are pure
The angel knockin' at my door
But I need something, something more
'Cause love has all been done before
And you are sweet and you are nice
Keep me calm and satisfied
But I need something, something more
'Cause love has all been done before
(Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh)
We're already done

You are good and you are pure
The angel knockin' at my door
But I need something, something more
'Cause love has all been done before
You are sweet and you are nice
Keep me calm and satisfied
But I need something, something more
'Cause love has all been done before

(Ooh, ooh)
Oh, love has all been done before
(Ooh, ooh)
Love has all been done before
Love has all been done before
Love has all been done before
You are sweet and you are pure
