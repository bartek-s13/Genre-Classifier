Oh, this is just the final day
The fight you gave, the fight I gave up
You burnt your lips 'cause you're unafraid
The light you gave, the light I gave up
Well I set it out in the fire blue
Your heart was in the valley too
In the desert I will carry you
I'll carry you and I'll carry you
And if this is the price to pay
You'll never look the other way
You'll never look the other way, oh

Catch me
Oh, my heart is steady
Oh, my light is growing
We're standing in oceans
Catch me
Oh, my heart is steady
Oh, my light is growing
We're standing in oceans

Oh, this is just the final game
The fight you gave, the fight I gave up
Dismiss the words your eyes betray
The light you gave, the light I gave up

If it's all I do
My heart beats true, and
With all I forgave
If this was ours again
I'd set it aflame

So catch me
Oh, my heart is steady
Oh, my light is growing
We're standing in oceans
Catch me
Oh, my heart is steady
Oh, my light is growing
We're standing in oceans

Catch me
Oh, my heart is steady
Oh, my light is growing
We're standing in oceans
