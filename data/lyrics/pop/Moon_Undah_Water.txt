Innocent bullshit
Warm but not in love
Yeah, I see what you are tryna pull
Baby please don’t let yourself think that you
Could get away with it, you sexy little thing

She’s just a tease
Completely at ease
She’s just a tease

Oh moon under water
You would not know what to do with the words that you drained from the room
You flirt, it’s dirt, the way you treat your boy
The poor son, he’s so in love with a sexy little thing

She’s just a tease
Completely at ease
She’s just a tease

Oh moon under water
You could not know what to do if I fell
And took you to the blue
So don’t speak, don’t explain
How you could bleed this boy
He is numb, so in love, with a sexy little thing
(Won’t you swim with me)
A sexy little thing

Oh moon
With all of your grief
Won’t you set these seas aside for me
So I may lay eyes upon my sweet, sweet moon

She’s just a tease
She's such a tease
She's just a tease
