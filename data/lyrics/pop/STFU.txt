Who’s making you smile like that?
On your phone
First it was your brother, now it’s your mom
But something just ain’t adding up, is it?
Who’s taking your time like that?
Where you been? First it was for work and now it’s a friend
This is getting kinda obvious

Stop tryna fool me
She's just a friend that you barely know right?
Is she your new me?
Keep telling yourself that she isn't your type
Excuse me, we both know what you were doing last night
The only good thing you can do to me now
Is shut the fuck up and get the fuck out

Shut the fuck, shut the fuck
Shut the fuck up
Shut the fuck, shut the fuck
Shut the fuck up and get the fuck out
Shut the fuck, shut the fuck
Shut the fuck up
Shut the fuck, shut the fuck
Who you seeing behind my back, is she sweet?
I hope you treat her better than you treated me
What's wrong? You think you'll get away with it?
No need to pack your bags, this is it
It all out of the window so I already did
I'll spell it for you, it's the end of us

Stop tryna fool me
She's just a friend that you barely know right?
Is she your new me?
Keep telling yourself that she isn't your type
Excuse me, we both know what you were doing last night
The only good thing you can do to me now
Is shut the fuck up and get the fuck out

Shut the fuck, shut the fuck
Shut the fuck up
Shut the fuck, shut the fuck
Shut the fuck up and get the fuck out
Shut the fuck, shut the fuck
Shut the fuck up
Shut the fuck, shut the fuck
Shut the fuck up and get the fuck out
Shut the fuck, shut the fuck, shut the fuck up
Shut the fuck up
Shut the fuck, shut the fuck
Shut the fuck up and get the fuck out
Shut the fuck, shut the fuck, shut the fuck fuck up
Shut the fuck up
The only good thing you can do to me now
Is shut the fuck up and get the fuck out
