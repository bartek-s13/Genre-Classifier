Verse 1:
Waking up late at night
Don’t know why
I just can’t fall asleep
Watch the news and get high
What a life
This is all that I need
Empty on emotion
Dazed and amused
Sedated but I’m focused
That way I never lose
Chorus:
But then my blood starts pumpin’
Heart starts thumpin’
Earth all shakin’
Mind goes runnin’
I can’t figure it out
I’m so confused
Thoughts start flyin’
Nerves start fryin’
Quick, quick breathin’
I think I’m dying
Why am I freakin out?
I need the truth
Verse 2:
Drivin’ round in my car
After dark
I just can’t be at home
Start a tab at the bar
Something hard
Get me out of my skull
Empty on emotion
Dazed and amused
Sedated but I’m focused
Oh what’s the use?
Chorus:
Cause then my blood starts pumpin’
Heart starts thumpin’
Earth all shakin’
Mind goes runnin’
I can’t figure it out
I’m so confused
Thoughts start flyin’
Nerves start fryin’
Quick, quick breathin’
I think I’m dying
Why am I freakin out?
I need the truth (need the truth)
Bridge:
I’m freakin’ out x 4
Internal:
Hey, it’s me.  I-uh, well, I was in the neighborhood and I just stopped by to ruin your day. Come on, you thought you were gonna feel good all day? I mean, shhhh. That’s not how this thing works baby. You just gotta get used to it... (used to it, used to it)
Chorus:
But then my blood starts pumpin’
Heart starts thumpin’
Earth all shakin’
Mind goes runnin’
I can’t figure it out
I’m so confused
Thoughts start flyin’
Nerves start fryin’
Quick, quick breathin’
I think I’m dying
Why am I freakin out?
