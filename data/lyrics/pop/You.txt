Way beyond the stars was a dream there waiting
For a dreamer to dream her
Barely just a spark in the open darkness of the ether
The world beneath her

I never could imagine
How my life would change the day you came
And how all my fears and worries would just wash away

I never saw it coming, then one day all of a sudden
There was you, you, you, you
I don't have to live without you anymore

How could it be so, that a heartless fool
Could burst wide open, be re-awoken?
Little did I know, what a simple thought could set in motion
A drop in the ocean

I've never seen the flowers or a sky so blue, it's all brand new
Like the sun on the horizon coming into view
I spent my whole life running, then one day all of a sudden
There was you, you, you, you
There was you, you, you, you
I don't have to live without you anymore

I never saw it coming, then one day all of a sudden
There was you, you, you, you
There was you, you, you, you
I don't have to live without you anymore

I don't have to live without you anymore
