When I’m shivering in the morning dust again
Then I sliver stale bread and give it to the doves
They are fluttering around me at the old marketplace
And then I worship somehow when we’re thinking out loud

What's the chapel of mine?
I begged you as we walked the brown meadows
All the colours were much more intense 'cause it had rained before

And the chapels I know are warm and inside
Are multi-entwined aisles I need to define
So that I could see its tortuous structures
I thought that you
Could lead me through

You believe to be on an ill-fated ship
But got enough time, live a satisfying life on it
And where all common-sense is gone
People want the chapels for their own
