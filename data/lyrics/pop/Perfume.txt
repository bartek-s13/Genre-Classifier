<<<<<<< HEAD
You better believe I fell in love with you
Dippin the pen again cause I want to claim you
I’ll write the rules and you will sign your name
Ink dries, I cut ties so move quickly my dear

They say I eat the greatest cake
I do and you can’t stop me
Take off
I can’t stand it
No more

Baby I choose you
Like new perfume
Not gonna lose you
Never gonna wash you off

Drippin' grace outside as I sip my tea
Conversations closed til you send me your deal
I’m not the type to sit and wait around
Rather have another drink and drown

They say I eat the greatest cake
I do and you can’t stop me ooo
Take off
I can’t stand it
No more

Baby I choose you
Like new perfume
Not gonna lose you
Never gonna wash you off

Cause you’re like perfume all on me
Cause you’re like perfume all on me
I’m gonna wear you endlessly
Perfume on me
Perfume on me

Baby I choose you
Like new perfume
Not gonna lose you
Never gonna wash you off
Never gonna wash you off

Can’t stop
Can’t stop
Can’t stop
Never gonna wash you off
Can’t stop
Can’t stop watching you
Can’t stop
