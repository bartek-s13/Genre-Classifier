Hello
How you doing babygirl hello
Lemme take it back to the cribo
And fuck you all night

Lil shawty it’s please to meet ya
Please to meet ya, babygirl pardon me
These hunnids on hunnids on hunnids on hunnids on hunnids on hunnids steady calling me
It’s not my fault, I was just born like that
Sit in the front not the back
Convertible Wag switch up, pull forth in a Jag, don’t ever settle for less
Lil shawty it’s please to meet ya
Please to meet ya, babygirl pardon me
Matter fact gotta Ocean suite by the bay, babygirl follow me
It’s not my fault, I can’t throw less than a bag, don’t ever settle for less
It’s not my fault, I was just born like that
Don’t ever settle for less

Big dreams
I put that S on my chest dawg
No strings
Man It is what it is dawg
Dont wanna go back and forth with karma
Unleash an big attack, kick back the armor
Niggas wanna watch my next move
My next move on a bigger scale than Neptune
My next move flying right thru on private jets
On a breakthrough, break proof like Pyrex
Baby girl bless the bottle of Cognac
She grab a big grip, shoot her way thru combat
Been patient cause I trust the process and lately it been shrinking away my problems
Plan a getaway, lemme watch ya blossom
Same wave, same game more flawless
No shame, look at my losses, no shame
Take a look at the Big frame, get on my boss shit, smooth change
Started from a stick shift, turn into a big drift
Money grew quick swift, no easy maintain
Hit em with a lane change
More than focus

It’s not my fault, got so much more in the vault
Turned a good win from a loss
It’s not my fault, baby I pathed the way
Just so these niggas can crawl
But this when it count
Got D’usse in my system, this when it count
This molly change the rhythm, need it  right now
So highly motivated, super underrated
Mhmm
Keep me stimulated
She wet, I’m lubricated
Follow regulation
On the way to graduation
Bitch I’m liberated
They want me isolated
I’m too damn educated
With so much dedication
No shame, look at my losses, no shame
Take a look at the Big frame, get on my boss shit, smooth change
