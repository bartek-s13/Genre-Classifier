My heart just sank, the moment I saw you
You're the image of a girl, that I used to know
Don't be alarmed if it seems hard, for me to explain
But every detail of your face, makes me recall her name

Hmmmmm I'm treading water, I keep, treading water

Maybe it's another chance, to mock myself again
Maybe it's another chance - I'm sure I'll fuck things up in the same way
Maybe it's another chance, to mock myself again

Can you forgive, the things I do, that I can't amend
Now the way I yearn for her, I hope you can't pretend
Girl, you're a fire, and you'll find, that I want to get burned
No matter what you can teach me, I'm sure I'll never learn

Hmmmmm I'm treading water, I keep, treading water

Maybe it's another chance, to mock myself again
Maybe it's another chance--I'm sure I'll fuck things up in the same way
Maybe it's another chance, to mock myself again

If my concentration seems spread too thin
And when you speak, my eyes glaze over
I'm sorry girl, it's not you, it's her

And you're another chance, to mock myself again
Maybe you're another chance - I'm sure I'll fuck things up in the same way
Maybe it's another chaaannncce
Maybe it's another chance, to mock myself again
Maybe you're another chance - I'm sure I'll fuck things up in the same way
