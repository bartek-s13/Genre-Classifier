Oh, let the love begin
Oh, let the love begin again, oh

I stood at light
I was turning to dust
Cold in the night
I was barren of trust
Locked in my heart
I couldn't believe how dark
On a whim, on the wind
You were summoned to me
And the sails they were filled
With a torrent of dreams
A kiss on the lips
You wake me from my sleep

'Cause I never wanted to be unfound
Suddenly I am the stranger in town
When all of the colors
You know, they all blackout

Can you wake, can you wake
Can you wake me up?
Can I take, can you take
Can you take me up?
I can't wait, I can't wait
I can't wait
'Cause it's been long enough
Can you reach to me now?
'Cause I've fallen in
And I'm caught in your wake
It's so hard to swim
Hold my hand, hold my hand
Hold my hand and let the love begin

Oh, let the love begin
Let the love begin
Let the love begin
Let the love begin again

Wheels turn us round in the clocks of our lives
All we have is our own private terror to hide
'Till the sun sings to someone
And glistens to the sky

'Cause I never wanted to be unfound
Suddenly I am the stranger in town
When all of the colors
You know, they all blackout
Blackout (x7)
Blackout (x7)
Can you wake, can you wake
Can you wake me up?
Can I take, can you take
Can you take me up?
I can't wait, I can't wait
I can't wait
'Cause it's been long enough
Can you reach to me now?
'Cause I've fallen in
And I'm caught in your wake
It's so hard to swim
Hold my hand, hold my hand
Hold my hand and let the love begin

Oh, let the love begin
Let the love begin
Oh, let the love begin
Let the love begin again
Let the love begin
Let the love begin
Oh, let the love begin again

Blackout (7x)
