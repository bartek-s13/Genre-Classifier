If I fall, would you take my car back?
If I fail with the test, would you know what is best?
Be my friend, be my love
Follow me to get lost, all the time
If I die, will you cry on my eye, little boy?
We could live in a house with two kids
You and me, diamond ring
We would do our own thing
Be my friend, be my love
Follow me to get lost, all the time
If I die, I will lay by your side
Come here, don't think
Don't stop, open up
Believin' in a place where you feel free
It's just another race for you and me
Let's fall in love
If I fall, would you take my car back?
If I fail with the test, would you know what is best?
Be my friend, be my love
Follow me to get lost, all the time
If I die, will you cry on my eye, little boy?
We could live in a house with two kids
You and me, diamond ring
We would do our own thing
Be my friend, be my love
Follow me to get lost, all the time
