<<<<<<< HEAD
Picture me ballin'
Picture me with the fifth of Henny, something foreign
Picture me ridin' 'round here with a Benzo
Picture me blunted with the tints on the window
You could see by the looks of it I got the feelin'
I told them bitches I'm something they should believe in
I told my mama they can't reach me, hit the ceilin'
Baby, this is just the beginning, it's preseason
I know that you can tell I got it though

Gotta go get it that's the reflex
I know you can tell the winners by how we flex
I ain't playin' with these niggas, ain't no recess
Next time I look around nigga way up, way up, way up, way up

Only bad bitches 'round here
I swear, it's only bad bitches 'round here
I mean, it's only real niggas 'round here
You know, it's only real niggas 'round here, I said
Only bad bitches 'round here
I swear, it's only bad bitches 'round here
I mean, it's only real niggas 'round here
You know, it's only real niggas 'round here, I said

Picture me speedin'
Picture me rollin' something up to chase the demons
Ah, that Cohiba really helped me slow the breathin'
You see these niggas 'round me, they all pledge allegiance
I never change for nothin', nigga that's some true shit
I got a mil, you got a mil, that's just some crew shit
They tryna stay afloat, I'm tryna build a cruise ship
I spent a half a decade workin' on the blueprint
Ay boy, we 'bout to hit the pot of gold

Gotta go get it that's the reflex
I know you can tell the winners by how we flex
I ain't playin' with these niggas, ain't no recess
Next time I look around nigga way up, way up, way up, way up

Only bad bitches 'round here
I swear, it's only bad bitches 'round here
I mean, it's only real niggas 'round here
You know, it's only real niggas 'round here, I said
Only bad bitches 'round here
I swear, it's only bad bitches 'round here
I mean, it's only real niggas 'round here
You know, it's only real niggas 'round here, I said

I been gettin' too fuckin' drunk nigga
High, been gettin' too fuckin' blunted lately
I just keep true, share one with you
Blame that liquor but it's how the world made me
I been movin' too fast I need to slow down
Said too many things that I shouldn't have said
Hey, just point out anywhere you want to go now
Now, I swear these niggas don't know what it takes

Only bad bitches 'round here
I swear, it's only bad bitches 'round here
I mean, it's only real niggas 'round here
You know, it's only real niggas 'round here, I said
Only bad bitches 'round here
I swear, it's only bad bitches 'round here
I mean, it's only real niggas 'round here
