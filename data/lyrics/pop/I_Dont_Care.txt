Waking up diagonal, like an animal
In a cold and empty bed, yeah
Shaking off the dream of you
I got shit to do and I'm ready to forget, aw yeah
I heard you brought that girl around in half a gown
And asked if I've been there, oh yeah
Ask me how I'm doing now, I scream aloud
I tell 'em I don't care
And I don't care

I don't care
And it feels so fucking good to say I swear
That I don't care
And everywhere
There are ordinary hearts that don't play fair
But I don't care

I don't care, oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh
I don't care, oh no
I don't care, oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh
I don't care, oh no

In this town, word gets around, it don't bring me down
It's just static in my head, yeah
So take me out and turn it up
Let's make it rough, we're gonna wake the dead, oh baby
Everyone is saying now to slow it down
Or I'll get hurt again, oh yeah
When these sins are feeling me
It's healing me and screaming I don't care
And I don't care

I don't care
And it feels so fucking good to say I swear
That I don't care
And everywhere
There are ordinary hearts that don't play fair
But I don't care

I don't care, oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh
I don't care, oh no
I don't care, oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh
I don't care, oh no

Doesn't matter anyway
Doesn't matter anyway, oh
I can see the Milky Way
And it seems so far away, oh
It doesn't matter anyway
It's all falling into place
Just another pretty face
Disappears without a trace
There ain't nothing left to say

I don't care, feels so good, oh
I don't care, oh I don't care
I don't care
And it feels so fucking good to say I swear
That I don't care
And everywhere
There are ordinary hearts that don't play fair
But I don't care

I don't care, oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh
I don't care, oh no
I don't care, oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh
I don't care, oh no
Woo!
