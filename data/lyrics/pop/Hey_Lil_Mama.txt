Hey little mama
Hope you're doing fine
Last time I saw you
Was when we said goodbye
Hey little mama
Hope your dreams came true
Still chasing mine
But last night I dreamed of you

And your starlet gaze, the way it cools
Me deep down in my soul
You led my heart a rage
Still, you'd always laugh at my crazy jokes

We held our heads to the gun
We chased our fears on the go
Sailed beyond the horizon
Far away from home
I know we tried to run the race
Sometimes the heat don't last
We were driving down the road
Somehow we cruised apart
Hey little mama
There's a world outside
Waiting to drag you down
Just don't give up the fight
Hey little mama
Hope you're doing your best
Not trying to have you back
And I've got no regrets

All your charming ways
Provided all the steam when nights were cold
I remember father said
Not every single thing that glitters turns to gold

We held our heads to the gun
We chased our fears on the go
Sailed beyond the horizon
Far away from home
I know we tried to run the race
Sometimes the heat don't last
We were driving down the road
I think we moved too fast
We held our heads to the gun
We chased our fears on the go
Sailed beyond the horizon
Far away from home
I know we tried to run the race
Sometimes the heat don't last
We were driving down the road
