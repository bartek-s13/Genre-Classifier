I don't mind if you lie with me
You're my friend
I don't like to hide
Think about all the finer things
In our lives
And how time can fly

Oh is it still you and I, forever?
Is it still you and I, forever?

Whether you like it or you don't
Sometimes we live alone
If we can find a little hope
We can make it on our own

I don't mind if you cry with me
You're my friend
I know times can get hard

Oh is it still you and I, forever?
Is it still you and I, forever?

Come on
You're close to me
Come on
So talk to me
Come on
Lay with me
Come on
You're close to me
Come on
Talk to me
Come on
Get close to me
(You and I)
Is it still?
Is it still you and I, forever?
