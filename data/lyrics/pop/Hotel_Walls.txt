I signed the papers for a lifelong lease
I rent the earth where I stay and the air I breathe
Then you forget that deal you made with God
While busy finding yourself being young, being dumb, and in love
It's all too easy and you're easily bored
Never once has it crossed your mind that life's too short
And there's a third person walking behind us
A tap on the back and it's there to remind us
Life is a blink of an eye 'til you are no more

So I stand back and I watch us fall
As we break everything inside these hotel walls
Life's for rent and it called us out
So I hand back the key as the door man bows

They greet you welcome with roses and champagne
When you walk through the lobby they all know your name
But all beautiful things come with edges and thorns
And the body you borrowed is starting to look kinda worn

So I stand back and I watch us fall
As we break everything inside these hotel walls
Life's for rent and it called us out
So I hand back the key as the door man bows

We're just grains in the universe
I let that comfort me when I'm anxious
The life is beautifully ugly at times
We're just grains in the universe
I let that comfort me when I'm anxious
The life is beautifully ugly at times
It's beautifully ugly at times
It's beautifully ugly at times
It's beautifully ugly at times
It's beautifully ugly at times

So I stand back and I watch us fall
As we break everything inside these hotel walls
You know that life's for rent and it called us out
So I hand back the key as the door man bows
