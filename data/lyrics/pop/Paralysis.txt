In the dark of the room
I gaze upon the paralytic
Staring beyond smiling
Desperate to say the words unsaid
Drawing closer to conclusion
Each breath draws nearer
Muttering insanity
To defile the sanctity
The folly of my strength is mocking all my failed attempts
Time and time again, the visions stab at me
Just let this nightmare fade
The end of sanity
To surrender the soul
Whispering oaths vile
To surrender the soul
Shadows surrounding me
Kill the promises to become
The acts of violence
Feel every heartbreak
I'm gripping at hopes to never dream
Left undone, terror takes every memory
Feel every heartbreak
I'm gripping at hopes to never dream
Left undone, terror takes every memory
In the dark of the room
I gaze upon the paralytic
Staring beyond desolation
