Walker, walker, walker, growling
Hey, walker, walker, walker
Walker, walker, walker, growling
Hey, walker, walker, walker
Uh, Joohunnit One Hunnit, yah
Excuse me, I'm walkin' like zombie, uh
Freakin', flippin' out, I'm electrified, it's shockin', uh
What a, what a day, you holdin' a gun against me, blackout blackout (huh huh)
You wanna crush me over with a choppa choppa
Block, block, block, can’t block block
Your blah blah, stop talking, -ing
Blow it up with your boom poison on my mouth, pop pop pop
Never gonna stop this, I don't care even if you cry
Ain't gotten time for ya just gonna make it drop
Broken soul and it's scattered
Walking this long dark road with a stagger
Lost and so agonized, dry for your love
Through the night I'm waiting for the savior
'Cause your love cuts through my heart like a razor
In the darkness, losing my way, giving my breath away
Love's like a shoot-out, shoot-out, shoot-out
Reckless shoot-out, shoot-out, shoot-out
If this is already over, if there's nothing to restore
Hope has no meaning to me no more
Love's like a shoot-out, shoot-out, shoot-out
Reckless shoot-out, shoot-out, shoot-out
Don't tell me your lies once again
Look who's the killer, killer, killer, shoot me down and dead
Walker, walker, walker, growling
Hey, walker, walker, walker
Walker, walker, walker, growling
Hey, walker, walker, walker
Uh, I.M what I am
I ain’t no mercy, primacy
I can promise it, ooh
Hold on, take your time
Gonna make that rip it up like a beast, yah
Grrr, bang bang, pierce through my heart now
Brrr, tough like stretched to the max, pow
Brrr, stresses, brrr, shakin'
Can't recover from the damage
Ever since you came into my world
Scratches are everywhere, I'm a bleeder
Lost and so agonized, dry for your love
Through the night I'm waiting for the savior
'Cause your love cuts through my heart like a razor
In the darkness, losing my way, giving my breath away
Love's like a shoot-out, shoot-out, shoot-out
Reckless shoot-out, shoot-out, shoot-out
If this is already over, if there's nothing to restore
Hope has no meaning to me no more
Love's like a shoot-out, shoot-out, shoot-out
Reckless shoot-out, shoot-out, shoot-out
Don't tell me your lies once again
Look who's the killer, killer, killer, shoot me down and dead
Fire, why you hesitating? Shoot your gun and end it
Kill me like you meant it
Fire, set me free from all this pain
'Cause I can't stand it
Love's like a shoot-out, shoot-out, shoot-out (yeah!)
Reckless shoot-out, shoot-out, shoot-out (shoot-out)
If this is already over, if there's nothing to restore
Hope has no meaning to me no more
Love's like a shoot-out, shoot-out, shoot-out (ooh whoa)
Reckless shoot-out, shoot-out, shoot-out (shoot-out)
Don't tell me your lies once again (once again)
Look who's the killer, killer, killer, shoot me down and dead
