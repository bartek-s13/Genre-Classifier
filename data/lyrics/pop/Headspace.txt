Far gone
You'd be better off if I was far gone
Running back to waste another chance on
Another pair of arms that'll carry you down

I only speak but never act
I give you all, then take it back
Everything you never asked for
Palm clenched tight
And I've tried my best to no avail
This coffin needs another nail
You're coming back to hear me say it
One more time cause I've

I've got you where I want you
But I don't even want you to stay
Would you hate me if I sent you away?
Would you call me if my mind began to change?
Cause I don't trust my headspace
It never stays in one place for long
Would you like me if I strung you along?
Cause you like me when I'm treating you wrong

Snowed in
Years of it have built up
And you're snowed in
There's nothing about you that deserves it
The rope that you have woven seems to pull the wrong crowd

I only speak but never act
I give you all, then take it back
Everything you never asked for
Palm clenched tight
And I've tried my best to no avail
This coffin needs another nail
You're coming back to hear me say it
One more time cause I've

I've got you where I want you
But I don't even want you to stay
Would you hate me if I sent you away?
Would you call me if my mind began to change?
Cause I don't trust my headspace
It never stays in one place for long
Would you like me if I strung you along?
Cause you like me when I'm treating you wrong
(I've got you where I want you
But I don't even want you to stay
Would you hate me if I sent you away?
Would you call me if my mind begin to change?)
Cause I don't trust my headspace
It never stays in one place for long
Would you like me if I strung you along?
Cause you like me when I'm treating you wrong
Would you like me if I strung you along?
Cause you like me when I'm treating you wrong
