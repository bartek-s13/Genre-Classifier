You kept all the things I threw away
A leaf I picked, a birthday card I made
Holding on to memories of you and me
We didn't last a year, well
We're just a box of souvenirs, 'cause

Maybe, I pulled the panic cord
And maybe, you were happy, I was bored
Maybe I wanted you to change
Maybe I'm the one to blame

This meant more to you than it did to me
I was full of doubts and you believed
The more that you keep coming over
The more I know it's over, dear, oh
We're just a box of souvenirs, and

Maybe, I pulled the panic cord
And maybe, you were happy, I was bored
Maybe I wanted you to change
Maybe I'm the one to blame
Maybe, you were just too nice to me
And maybe, it took me way too long to leave
Maybe once we felt the same
Maybe I'm the one to blame
Maybe I'm the one to blame

Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La, Ti, Do
That's the way the story goes
Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La, Ti, Do
That's the way the story goes

Maybe, I pulled the panic cord
And maybe, you were happy, I was bored
Maybe I wanted you to change
Maybe I'm the one to blame, oh

Maybe, you were just too nice to me
And maybe, it took me way too long to leave
Maybe once we felt the same
Maybe I'm the one to blame
Maybe I'm the one to blame
