<<<<<<< HEAD
Not sad enough to watch what's takin' place
Not sellin' off my feelin' to relate
But you can name a price; oh, you're eloquent? That's nice
Praise be on high to fate

But God already forgot me
Cut off both my hands, changed the locks again, that's alright
'Cause an angel caught me
She pays all my rent, paints the walls and then sings all night
All night, all night
Gospel can't compete with her, they don't shine a light
All right, all right, all right, yeah
I'll be good forever, least the rest of my life, all right

More friends than I consider in the polls
More drinks so we can study different roles
A dropout on your hands, no pockets in my pants
No problem could be solved, so
What's wrong with her? Not a thing in my head, yeah
What's calling up those memories again?
I once was at a loss, the saviour cut me off
Before you came along
It was God who already forgot me
Cut off both my hands, changed the locks again, that's alright
A fuckin' angel caught me
She pays all my rent, paints the walls and then sings all night
All night, all night, yeah
Gospel can't compete with her, they don't shine a light
All right, all right, all right, yeah
I'll be good forever, least the rest of my life, all right

So what? God forgot
So what? Carry on
So why don't we get off?
I know this place on the next, next block

You're the best that there is on this earth
You know what? You know that you are
You know what? You know that you are
The best that there is on this earth
You're the best that there is on this earth
You know what? You know that you are
You know what? You know that you are
The best that there is on this earth
But God already forgot me
Cut off both my hands, changed the locks again, that's alright
A fuckin' angel caught me
She pays all my rent, paints the walls and then sings all night
All night, all night, yeah
Gospel can't compete with her, they don't shine a light
All right, all right, all right, yeah
I'll be good forever, least the rest of my life
I'll be good forever, least the rest of my life, all right

Here, Scotty, hear the kick drum?
