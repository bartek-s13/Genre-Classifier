Can you feel me when I think about you?
With every breath I take
Every minute, no matter what I do
My world is an empty place
Like I've been wandering the desert for a thousand days (Oh)
Don't know if it's a mirage, but I always see your face, baby

I'm missing you so much
Can't help it, I'm in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side
Don't know how I'll survive
A day without you is like a year without rain, oh, oh-oh
Whoa, whoa

The stars are burning, I hear your voice in my mind
(Voice in my mind)
Can't you hear me calling?
My heart is yearning, like the ocean that's running dry
Catch me, I'm falling
It's like the ground is crumbling underneath my feet
Won't you save me?
There's gonna be a monsoon when you get back to me
Oh, baby
I'm missing you so much
Can't help it, I'm in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side (By my side)
Don't know how I'll survive (How I'll survive)
A day without you is like a year without rain, oh, oh-oh
Whoa, whoa

So let this drought come to an end
And make this desert flower again
I'm so glad you found me
Stick around me baby, baby, baby, ooh
It's a world of wonder with you in my life
So hurry, baby, don't waste no more time
And I need you here, I can't explain
A day without you is like a year without rain, oh, oh-oh

I'm missing you so much (So much)
Can't help it, I'm in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side (By my side)
Don't know how I'll survive
A day without you is like a year without rain, oh, oh-oh
