I can't believe I had to see
The girl of my dreams cheating on me
The pain you caused has left me dead inside
I'm gonna make sure, you regret that night

I feel you close, I feel you breathe
And now it's like you're here
You're haunting me
You're out of line, you're out of sight
You're the reason that we started this fight

But I, I, I know
I just gotta let it go
I, I should've known
I gotta learn to say goodbye now
I throw my armour down
And leave the battleground
For the final time now
I, I know
I'm running from a warzone

In our house, I hate that place
Everywhere I walk I see your face
Try to erase a memory with a flame
And hope I'll never see you again
Standing here, in this burning room
You know the end could never come so soon

It's clear to me
The lies you used
The ones that killed me ain't hurting you so

I, I, I know
I just gotta let it go
I, I should've known
I gotta learn to say goodbye now
I throw my armour down
And leave the battleground
For the final time now
I, I know
I'm running from a warzone

I'm running from a warzone
I can't do this anymore
I'm running from a warzone
What are we fighting for?
I'm running from a Warzone

I, I, I know
I just gotta let it go
I, I should've known
I gotta learn to say goodbye now
I throw my armour down
And leave the battleground
For the final time now
I, I know
