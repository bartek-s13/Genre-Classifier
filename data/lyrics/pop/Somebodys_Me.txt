You, do you remember me?
Like I remember you?
Do you spend your life, going back in your mind to that time?
'Cause I, I walk the streets alone
I hate being on my own
And everyone can see that I really fell, and I'm going through hell
Thinking about you with somebody else

Somebody wants you, somebody needs you
Somebody dreams about you every single night
Somebody can't breathe, without you it's lonely
Somebody hopes that one day you will see
That somebody's me
That somebody's me, yeah

How? How could we go wrong?
It was so good and now it's gone
And I pray at night that our paths soon will cross
And what we had isn't lost
'Cause you're always right here in my thoughts

Somebody wants you, somebody needs you
Somebody dreams about you every single night
Somebody can't breathe, without you it's lonely
Somebody hopes that one day you will see
That somebody's me, oh yeah
You will always be in my life, even if I'm not in your life
Cause you're in my memory
You, when you remember me
And before you set me free
Oh, listen please

Somebody wants you, somebody needs you
Somebody dreams about you every single night
Somebody can't breathe, without you it's lonely
Somebody hopes that some day you will see
That somebody's me, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
That somebody's me, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
That somebody's me, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
