Do you remember a day in October
The leaves were falling just like me when it was over
One more day of sorrow and I'll struggle to stay sober
Hope to see you later when I get older
I still remember the smell of your perfume
It hasn't left me since the day you made me blue
I think I saw you but I know I'm not supposed to
I must be dreaming 'cause I don't believe in ghosts, yeah
I must be dreaming 'cause I don't believe in ghosts, yeah
I must be dreaming 'cause I don't believe in ghosts, yeah
I don't believe in ghosts
I don't believe in ghosts
I don't believe in ghosts
I don't believe in ghosts
I don't believe in ghosts
I don't believe in ghosts
I don't believe in ghosts
I don't believe in ghosts
