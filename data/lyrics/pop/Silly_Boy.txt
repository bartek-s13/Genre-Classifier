You say you're not ready for a long term thing
It's got too hot and heavy, not like I want a ring
Such an over-thinker, you've given yourself spooks
But why'd you have to fight
When you know it's something good?
Used to joke about my age, but now who's acting young?
So many things I want to say on the tip of my tongue
But not gonna waste my breath, I'll just let you do you
But stupid to ignore it when you know it's somethin'

So go run a mile 'cause you're scared of my smile
You say that it's self-preservation
'Cause you can't fall in love, it's all just too much
You're startin' to really, kinda fully test my patience

Silly, silly, silly, silly boy, what you playin' for?
Not convinced that I'm your favorite toy, make me insecure
But time is on my side, I know you'll miss me in a week
Then my silly, silly boy will come back beggin' at my feet

You say it's upsetting that it has to end
You're open to ideas, but we can't just be friends
You're such an silly boy, uh, you'd rather quit than knock on wood
But why'd you have to throw it
When you know it's something good?
So go run a mile 'cause you're scared of my smile
You say that it's self-preservation
'Cause you can't fall in love, it's all just too much
You're startin' to really, kinda fully test my patience

Silly, silly, silly, silly boy, what you playin' for?
Not convinced that I'm your favorite toy, make me insecure
But time is on my side, I know you'll miss me in a week
Then my silly, silly boy will come back beggin' at my feet

(Oh, oh-oh, oh)
(Oh, oh-oh, oh)
Silly, silly, silly, silly (Oh, oh-oh, oh)
(Oh, oh-oh, oh)
You're puttin' up a wall for the sake of, the sake of it, mhm
Cuttin' somethin' short 'cause you're scared of it, scared of it, it
Silly, silly, silly, silly (Silly, silly) boy

Silly, silly, silly, silly boy, what you playin' for?
Not convinced that I'm your favorite toy, make me insecure
But time is on my side, I know you'll miss me in a week
Then my silly, silly boy will come back beggin' at my feet
(Oh, oh-oh, oh)
(Oh, oh-oh, oh) You're so silly, silly, silly, silly
Silly, silly, silly, silly (Oh, oh-oh, oh)
(Oh, oh-oh, oh) That silly, silly, silly, silly boy
Mhm (Hahahaha)
