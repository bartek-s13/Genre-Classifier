Broken home baby, I can never blame ya'
No one ever taught you how to love right
No one ever taught you how to stand by when it's uphill
And more times, this love is just uphill, yeah
You're always fighting something, you never stop running
You don't even bother tryna keep a smile
Let me take your bags, boy, let me try
We might be alright
Perfect ain't coming, but we'll be alright, yuh

You just gotta, just gotta love me
Don't let goodbyes come too easy
Love me
Just let me know that you need me
Love me
I'll teach you how to love me (Love me)

Broken home baby, I can never hate ya
Even though you drain the soul out of my eyes
Even though you had me crying every night
I see you're trying
I'm grateful 'cause I see you're trying, yeah, yeah
I know, I know, I know I shouldn’t stay
But I'm stuck tryna save you from you
Yeah, you should know that I'm at your mercy
I've spent my life searching for you
So you just gotta, gotta love me
Don't let goodbye come too easy
Love me
Just let me know that you need me
Love me
I'll teach you how to love, yuh
You just gotta, gotta love me
Don't let goodbye come too easy
Love me
Just let me know that you need me
Love me
I'll teach you how to love me

I'll teach you how to love me
Oh, I'll teach you how to love me, how to love me
