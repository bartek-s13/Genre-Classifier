I'm in trouble now
'Cause it's down to me to heal
From the words that I spoke in my head
From the bane that I caused and I fed

And I can't wait till I look at you
And all I see is love
'Cause I'm tired of trying to hate you

Hurting for your body
Hurting for your body and your soul
You really got me searching
Begging for a way to make me whole
Hurting for your body
Hurting for your body and your soul
But I know you had me
Begging for the power that you stole

I wanna blame you now
But I know what tortures me
Those lies that I tell to myself
Disguised and sending me to hell
And I can't wait till I look at you
And all I see is love
'Cause I'm tired of trying to hate you

Hurting for your body
Hurting for your body and your soul
You really got me searching
Begging for a way to make me whole
Hurting for your body
Hurting for your body and your soul
But I know you had me
Begging for the power that you stole

And I can't wait till I look at you
And all I see is love
'Cause I'm tired of trying to hate you
