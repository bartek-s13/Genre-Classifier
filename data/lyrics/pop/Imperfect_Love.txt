:
Ohhhh, Ohhhhh, OhhhhYaaa
Ohhhh, Ohhhh, OhhhhYaaa
:
I know that you think
Sometimes less of me
Maybe you're not wrong
There's something inside myself
That doesn't belong
I'm trying to find where my heart is lowest
I'm trying to find where my mind's not the best
All I can do is be honest
About all the tension
Inside my chest
Give it up to the Lord
And let him do the rest
:
This imperfect love
Oh is it enough
If I stay
This imperfect love
Oh take all this pain away
Cause If I knew why
I was so blind, Oh
I would change
This imperfect love
Just isn't enough
If I stay
Ohhhh, Ohhhhh, OhhhhYaaa
Ohhhh, Ohhhh, OhhhhYaaa
:
You know that I'm trying
But you still call me out like I'm lying
But maybe I'm not strong
Feel like somethings dying
I've been hurting so long
I'm trying to find where my heart is lowest
I'm trying to find where my mind's not the best
All I can do is be honest
About all the tension
Inside my chest
Give it up to the Lord
And let him do the rest
:
This imperfect love
Oh is it enough
If I stay
This imperfect love
Oh take all this pain away
Cause If I knew why
I was so blind, Oh
I would change
This imperfect love
Just isn't enough
If I stay
Ohhhh, Ohhhhh, OhhhhYaaa
Ohhhh, Ohhhh, OhhhhYaaa
