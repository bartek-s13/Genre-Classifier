You think you look better, I know you feel worse
If nothing were numb, I think something would hurt
I've seen this before, never thought you'd be her
You're young and you're precious, your laugh is infectious
Your heart's big as Texas, don't think you're reckless
But maybe you strayed from the cross on your necklace
And now I feel selfish 'cause I miss my best friend
Still skipping breakfast and higher than Everest

Slowing down the time, you can say you're fine
But this is too familiar, you know it runs in mine
I don't wanna fight or overstep the line
But this is too familiar, you know it runs in mine

I'm sleeping all day for my baby
It's my cotton ball putting up another wall, way of escaping
Being awake isn't what I wanna be, I wanna be asleep
Or I wanna be a bird, or I wanna be a tree
Or be living by the sea, I don't wanna be a creep
I wanna be asleep
Dreams would be nice but then nothing is fine for now
I should have more on my mind
I don't mind but I say that we're fine
I'm inanimate I'm not a fan of it
Honestly thinking that something is up
I know you're the same but I'm not gonna ask
What would I ask? (Not gonna ask)

Slowing down the time, you can say you're fine
But this is too familiar, you know it runs in mine
I don't wanna fight or overstep the line
But this is too familiar, you know it runs in mine
Slowing down the time, you can say you're fine
But this is too familiar, you know it runs in mine
I don't wanna fight or overstep the line
But this is too familiar, you know it runs in mine

Different things and picking on dreams
And picking on me when I tried picking you up
Tried not giving you up
And when I die, I'll ask if I did enough
I'll pray that I'll live to know that I did
Pray for your weight and you wait for your freight
That you ordered online and I say
Boxes arrived I try waking you up again
Doctors arrived, you were taking too much again
Somebody said I say, "Thank you" too much again
Back to school late and without any lunch again
I'm not giving you up
No one's heart feels pretty on the outside
Lies you tell are pretty much outright
And I hate it when we speak
Counting sheep, I'm tryna sleep

Your heart's big as Texas
Your heart's big as Texas
Your heart's big as Texas
Your heart's big as Texas
Your heart's big as Texas
Your heart's big as Texas
Your heart's big as Texas
Your heart's big as Texas
Your heart's big as Texas
Your heart's big as Texa-
