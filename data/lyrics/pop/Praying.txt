I've walked through hell, and I've battled the storms
I know too well how, it feels when you fall

I'm on this road, and I won't' lose my faith
Pack it up, pack it up, 'cause I'm on my way
For so long....

I've been praying, for a brighter day
I've been praying, trying to find my way
Cause time moves on and seasons change
Nothing ever stays the same
Praying, I keep praying

I've over due, just a little bit of luck
I get the taste, but its never enough
I'm on this road
And I won't lose my faith
Pack it up, pack it up cause I'm on my way
For so long....

I've been praying for a brighter day
I've been praying trying to find my way
Time moves on and seasons change
Nothing ever stays the same
Praying, I keep praying
On my own, I search high and low
Till I find what I've been looking for
I'm in my deep end and I won't be beaten till I find what I've been praying for...

I've been praying, for a brighter day
I've been praying, trying to find my way
Cause time moves on and seasons change
Nothing ever stays the same
Praying, I keep praying

I keep praying
I keep praying
Cause time moves on and seasons change
Nothing ever stays the same
Praying, I keep praying
