Starting o-o-o-over
Starting o-o-o-over

I don't know what you feel, ayy
Too long, you know how I feel for you
And I'm chasing for signs, losing my mind
Lately, you've been out of reach
Actin' so indifferent when we speak
I can feel you're distant when you're close, close to me
Even when you're close, close to me

You've got me stuck in my head
And I've got you drinking again
Maybe we can learn from this
Or we can let it all crash down now
Did you feel this? We can beat this, yeah
Or maybe we should start it over

O-o, o-o, over
O-o, o-o, over
Maybe we should start it over
O-o, o-o, over (Start it over)
O-o, o-o, over (Start it o-o-o, start it over)

Yeah, well I've tried to give it all
Well, I've tried to be right for ya
And then I let it all fall
So I could learn how to fly for ya
And I know that you love it
I know you love it when I'm real with you
But this is real as it gets, I'm so sick of this sh**
I'm addicted to this burn

You've got me stuck in my head
And I've got you drinking again
Maybe we can learn from this
Or we can let it all crash down now
Did you feel this? We can beat this, yeah
Or maybe we should start it over

O-o, o-o, over
O-o, o-o, over
Maybe we should just start it over
O-o, o-o, over (Start it over)
O-o, o-o, over (Start it o-o-o, start it over)

There's a sound in the distant
It's a whisper, a mumble
Close your mouth and just listen
Can you hear that thunder?
There's a sound in the distance
It's a whisper, a mumble
Close your mouth and just listen
Or maybe we should start it over

O-o, o-o, over
Can you hear, can you hear that thunder
O-o, o-over
O-o, o-o, over
Maybe we should start it over
O-o, o-o, over (Start it over)
O-o, o-o, over (Start it o-o-o, start it over)
