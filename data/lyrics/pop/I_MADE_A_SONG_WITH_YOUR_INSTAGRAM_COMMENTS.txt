She said that better days are not that far away
But those words of venom
I lose myself in your eyes
In those words of venom
I wish I was by your side
Being loved by you is all I need
You make me feel alive
Why do people always leave

You said that only fools would fall for you
Now, why'd you need me I ain't gonna help
You said let's love each other for a moment
But first you love yourself then someone else

I'm sippin' alchohol like there's no tommorow
But there's school tomorrow
I lift my head up and the world's on fire
Fu-
There's school tomorrow
No-oh oh oh yeah
I wish I was by your side
Being loved by you is all I need
It's all I need, baby
You make me feel alive
Why do people always leave
Oh they always leave oh
You said that only fools would fall for you
Now, why'd you need me I ain't gonna help
You said let's love eachother for a moment
But first you love yourself then someone else
First you love yourself than someone else
