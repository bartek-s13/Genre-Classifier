She said
Do you really wanna know it all
He said
You're not real
I got their call
I know you're gone
I'm moving on
She said
I saw you in October
He said
You're not real
I know it's over
Imagination is always taking over me
But in the back of my mind
I know it's all dream
It's all a dream
She said
Do you really wanna know it all
He said
You're not real
I got their call
I know you're gone
I'm moving on
She said
I saw you in October
He said
You're not real
I know it's over
Imagination is always taking over me
But in the back of my mind
I know it's all a dream
(drop)
I know it's all a dream
(drop)

All a dream, all a dream, all a dream
