I'm saying no way
Ain't tryna play games
You always gotta take
Ain't nothing to say
You're coming in late
I been here all day
Just stay in your place
It better that way

See me bleeding gold and
Make me fit your moulding
And I know why, yeah, I know why
Used to think I'm playing
Now you tryna claim me
And I know what ya doing, think I don't see?

I don't need your fake ass hanging 'round me
So it's bye bye, bye bye
I ain't just a ride you getting for free
So drive by, bye bye
You think you know all about me
But you don't know a thing about me
I don't need your fake ass hanging 'round me
So it's bye bye, bye bye

Now you think I'm hella pretty
And I'm only just for show
Got you asking for that something
I can tell you where to go
I been working day and all night
Now that tide is starting to rise
You had nothing to do with my life
Had nothing to do with my shine

'Cause I'm dripping in diamonds
I don't need your lying
And I know why, yeah, I know why
Used to think I'm playing
Now you tryna claim me
And I know what ya doing, think I don't see?

I don't need your fake ass hanging 'round me
So it's bye bye, bye bye
I ain't just a ride you getting for free
So drive by, bye bye
You think you know all about me
But you don't know a thing about me
I don't need your fake ass hanging 'round me
So it's bye bye, bye bye

I don't wanna be the one you hate
Maybe this the sacrifice I make
I don't wanna be the one you hate

I don't need your fake ass hanging 'round me
So it's bye bye, bye bye
I ain't just a ride you getting for free
So drive by, bye bye
You think you know all about me
But you don't know a thing about me
I don't need your fake ass hanging 'round me
