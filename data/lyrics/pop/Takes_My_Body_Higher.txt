I saw you in my dreams, middle of the night
You're everything I need, together we're gold
My heart is sold to you
Saw you in the summer, your face came to life
You can be my lover, the skies are blue
Our feelings grew

You hold me down, set my soul on fire
Your voice that sound takes my body higher
Oh na na, Oh na na
Takes my body higher
Oh na na, Oh na na
Takes my body higher

Takes my body, takes my body
Takes my body higher
Takes my body, takes my body
Takes my body higher
Oh na na, Oh na na
Takes my body higher
Oh na na, oh na na
Takes my body higher

Spent the days together, melting in the sun
Skinny dipping weather, we fell so deep
Only took a week
Lazy afternoons, laying in the sheets
I smell like her perfume, she's in my arms
My lucky charms

You hold me down, set my soul on fire
Your voice that sound takes my body higher
Oh na na, oh na na
Takes my body higher
Oh na na, oh na na
Takes my body higher

Takes my body, takes my body
Takes my body higher
Takes my body
Takes my body higher
Oh na na, oh na na
Takes my body higher
Oh na na, oh na na
Takes my body higher

Takes my body
Takes my body higher
Takes my body
Takes my body higher
Takes my body, takes my body
Takes my body higher
Takes my body
Takes my body higher
Takes my body, takes my body
Takes my body higher
Takes my body
Takes my body higher
Oh na na, oh na na
Takes my body higher
Oh na na, Oh na na
