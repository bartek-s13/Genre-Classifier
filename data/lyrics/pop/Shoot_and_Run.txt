When she was young
They gave her a gun
And said shoot and run
It's a job well done
It's a job well done
If you speak its language
It'll do the rest
A little too soon she put it to the test
She put it to the test

Oh she doesn't know much
But she knows this
Life's too short not to take risks
So she steels herself
And she goes for luck
She pulls the trigger

And lives it up
Oh, oh live it up
Oh, oh, oh live it up
Oh, oh live it up
Oh, oh

Happy hunter
Ripe fresh kill
On to the next one
Got to chase the thrill
You got to chase the thrill
If you want to have fun
You've got to shoot and run
And leave leave leave it all behind
Behind behind behind

Oh she doesn't know much
But she knows this
Life's too short not to take risks
So she steels herself
She doesn't give a fuck
She pulls the trigger

And lives it up
Oh, oh live it up
Oh, oh, oh live it up
Oh, oh live it up
Oh, oh

She shoots and runs
She shoots and runs
She shoots and runs
She shoots and runs
She shoots and runs
She shoots and runs
She shoots and
She shoots and
She shoots and she
Runs (she loves it, she loves it, she loves it)
Runs (she loves it, she loves it)
She lives it up

Oh, oh live it up
Oh, oh, oh live it up
Oh, oh live it up
Oh, oh

She lives it up (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohh)
She shoots and runs
She shoots and runs
She shoots and runs
She shoots and runs (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohh)
She shoots and runs
She shoots and runs
She shoots and runs
She loves it, she loves it, she loves it
She loves it, she loves it, she loves it
She loves it, she loves it, she loves it
(She loves it, she loves it, she loves it)
