Oh, say can you see, by the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, thro' the perilous fight
O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming
And the rockers' red glare, the bombs bursting in air
Gave proof thro' the night that our flag was still there
O say, does that star spangled banner yet wave
