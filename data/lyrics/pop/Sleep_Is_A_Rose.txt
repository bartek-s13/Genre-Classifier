Sleep is a rose
But I only hear the gale wind blowing cold
Against my windows
As I fold then I curl my leg around yours in a hold
I said, "darling, I'm scared of growing old"
I'm sorry if I'm loud
I'm just worrying about that now

'Cause I lay here
I'm still waiting for the sun

And you said sleep is a rose
But I wanna tell you it only brings me fear
And you said sleep is a rose
But I wanna tell you it only brings me fear

I started to listen to every little sound
And so how am I supposed to forget silence?
As I fold and I curl my own head around yours in a hold
You said, "my love, I'll take you to the fairground"
I know you're not around
You're sleeping and talking now

And I'm still laying here
Just waiting for the sun

And you said sleep is a rose
But I wanna tell you it only brings me fear
And you said sleep is a rose
But I wanna tell you it only brings me fear

And you said, "boy, you better know that you got this love"
And you said, "boy, you better know that you got this love"

And you said sleep is a rose
But I wanna tell you it only brings me fear
Yeah, you said sleep is a rose
But I wanna tell you it only brings me fear

So I hope morning comes 'round soon
