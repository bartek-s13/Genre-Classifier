I hope you find what you're looking for when it all comes running down
I hope you find it painted black on your window, or the lips of your lover's frown
Cuz if it dies in cold, when the clouds start to roll
Is it then that your soul, starts to bleed?
Have you ever seen the President who killed your wounded child?
Or the man that crashed your sister's plane claiming he was sent of God?
And when she died in your arms, late that night in the dark
Did you pray to your God to come home?
Cuz it ain't fair to say, that these tracks are the same

So God if you can hear me crash this train
I said God if you can hear me crash this train
Now a note to the President, and the Government, and the Judges of this place
We're still waiting for you to bring our troops home, clean up that mess you made
Cuz it smells of blood and money and oil across the Iraqi land
But it seems so easy here to blind us with your "United We Stand"
And it ain't hard to see that this Country ain't free

To the mothers and to the fathers who've done the best they could
Cuz raisin' youngins in a messed up world, it ain't so understood
So I'll cover my ears, and my eyes, pretend that love's the same
Cuz with one court's signature, it all becomes erased
And it ain't hard to tell
When it's love that we sell

I said God if you can hear me crash this train
I said my God if you can hear me crash this train
