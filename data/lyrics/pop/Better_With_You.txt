I know it's ugly turning on the news
There's people fighting over point of view
Sometimes it's like there's nothing left to lose
And I don't know what to do
But I know it's better with you

I was a wreck when you came along
When there was nothing left
You showed me the best
I'm still a mess but you hold on
Don't know just why you do
But I know I'm better with you
But I know I'm better with you
But I know I'm better with you
But I know I'm better with you

For every life there is a silent cry
For every day there is a darker night
Sometimes this life doesn't treat us right
And I don't know what to do
But I know it's better with you

I was a wreck when you came along
When there was nothing left
You showed me the best
I'm still a mess but you hold on
Don't know just why you do
But I know I'm better with you
But I know I'm better with you
But I know I'm better with you

Wherever you are, it's never as dark
Whenever I start slipping, you make all the difference
Been there from the start, no matter how hard
Whatever piece is missing, you know how to fix it

I was a wreck when you came along
When there was nothing left
You showed me the best
I'm still a mess but you hold on
Don't know just why you do
But I know I'm better with you
But I know I'm better with you
