These rooms got a lot of space
Crowded but a lonely place
Sittin' at a table full of double dates
And everywhere I go, I wanna see your face
Pictures, I’m reminded
Of good times, how we tried it (Tried it)
Don't know how to get you out of my head
I don't have it in me to deny it

’Cause everybody, everybody knows something I don't (I don't)
And I wonder, and I wonder how to keep a good thing going (I wonder, I won—)

All my friends are falling in love
All my friends are locking it up
But I can't seem to settle down
'Cause I'm waiting on you to come around
While all my friends are falling in love

They say that love is true (It's true)
And I'll find somebody new (’body new)
And everybody lookin’ like a honeymoon (Ayy)
But all that I've been looking for is me and you (Me and you)
’Cause everybody, everybody knows something I don't (I don't)
And I wonder, and I wonder how to keep a good thing going

All my friends are falling in love
All my friends are locking it up
But I can't seem to settle down
’Cause I'm waiting on you to come around
While all my friends are falling in love

Falling in love
Falling in love

'Cause everybody, everybody knows something I don't (Everybody, everybody knows something)
And I wonder, and I wonder how to keep a good thing going (And I wonder, and I wonder how to keep a good thing—)

All my friends are falling in love (In love, in love)
All my friends are locking it up (They locking it up)
But I can't seem to settle down (Settle down)
'Cause I'm waiting on you to come around (Come around but)
While my friends are falling in love (Ayy)
Falling in love (I'm falling, I'm falling)
Falling in love (I'm falling, I'm falling)
Falling in love
But I can't seem to settle down
'Cause I'm waiting on you to come around
While all my friends are falling in love
