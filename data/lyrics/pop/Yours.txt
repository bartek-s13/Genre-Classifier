Got a 20 pound note, rolled up, rolled up
A lil' squashed in my pocket
Don't you give me those eyes
We can stop by the shop, get some rum if you want it, want it

I'm tired tryna fight it and fight you
Fight this and fight it all
Let's get out of the rain
Get a cab to my house, we can snuggle up

Oo hoo hoo, oo hoo hoo, it's yours
Oo hoo hoo, oo hoo hoo, all yours
Oo hoo hoo, oo hoo hoo, it's yours
Oo hoo hoo, oo hoo hoo, all yours

Got your hands in my head
And the door starts to ring, I'm guessing that's the pizza
Well, let him quiver in the cold
‘Cause all that I want is a piece now of you love, hold us

I'm tired tryna fight it and fight you
And fight this and fight it all
Let's get out of the rain
Get a cab to my house, we can snuggle up

Come on, let it drop

Oo hoo hoo, oo hoo hoo, it's yours
Oo hoo hoo, oo hoo hoo, all yours
Oo hoo hoo, oo hoo hoo, it's yours
Oo hoo hoo, oo hoo hoo, all yours

It's yours, na
Na na na, na na na, all yours
No, oo oo ha, hey hey hey, it's yours
Oh no, oo oo oo, ah ah ah, all yours
