It's that old school love, old school love
Flowers in my hand, I'm gonna take it back
To that old school love, old school love

I don't promise a lot, but I'm keeping my word
I'm never gonna desert you
You want something real and I want it too
I don't feel like me without you

It's that old school love, old school love
Flowers in my hand, I'm gonna take it back

Physically and emotionally
