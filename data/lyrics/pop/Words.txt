<<<<<<< HEAD
The sound waves of your voice
Make me swim
Through the storm
In a form
I never knew about
It’s so new
Just like you
In my life

But yet it feels like I've never lived before
Anything that's less turned into more
Everything I've loved but couldn't score
All I adore

I'm in love with your words
Will you show me the world?
Through your eyes 'cause you know
Just the way to put it on me
I'm in love with your words
Will you show me the world?
Through your eyes 'cause you know
Just the way to put it on me

The way you drive the road
Got my feet
Running fast
With no despair
'Cause you make me believe
It could one day be me
Over there

But yet it feels like I've never lived before
Anything that's less turned into more
Everything I've loved but couldn't score
All I adore

I'm in love with your words
Will you show me the world?
Through your eyes 'cause you know
Just the way to put it on me
I'm in love with your words
Will you show me the world?
Through your eyes 'cause you know
Just the way to put it on me
I'm in love with your words
Will you show me the world?
Through your eyes 'cause you know
Just the way to put it on me
