Ooh, don't we look good together?
There's a reason why they watch all night long
Yeah, know we'll turn heads forever
So tonight I'm gonna show you off

When I'm walkin' with you
I watch the whole room change
Baby, that's what you do
No my baby don't play
Blame it on my confidence
Oh, blame it on your measurements
Shut that shit down on sight
That's right

We out here drippin' in finesse
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know it
We out here drippin' in finesse
It don't make no sense
Out here drippin' in finesse
You know it, you know it

Now slow it down for me baby
'Cause I love the way it feels when we grind
Yeah, our connection's so magnetic on the floor
Nothing can stop us tonight

When I'm walkin' with you
I watch the whole room change
Baby, that's what you do
No my baby don't play
Blame it on my confidence
Oh, blame it on your measurements
Shut that shit down on sight
That's right
