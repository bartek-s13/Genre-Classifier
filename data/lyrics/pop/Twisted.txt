When I see you I get all shook up and my eyes start blurring down
Head high off a Brooklyn buzz with my nerves all tweaking out
Still it feels like paradise when your lips press down so slow
You chew me up then you spit me out like some gum or tobacco
Got me singing like

I don't know what it is
But your love has got me twisted
Stone cold like I'm a kid
Off my dad's alcohol cabinet
I'm young and I'm listless
To your love is in my blood
Ooh girl, you got me twisted
You got me twisted
You got me twisted

Now I'm tripping all over myself plus I'm stuttering and talking fast
Got the spins I could use some help but when I ask you just start to laugh
Still it feels like paradise when your lips press down so slow
You're so hot 'til you had enough then you're cold like an eskimo
Got me singing like

I don't know what it is
But your love has got me twisted
Stone cold like I'm a kid
Off my dad's alcohol cabinet
I'm young and I'm listless
To your love is in my blood
Ooh girl, you got me twisted
You got me twisted
You got me twisted
You got me twisted

I don't know what it is
But your love has got me twisted
Stone cold like I'm a kid
Off my dad's alcohol cabinet
I'm young and I'm listless
To your love is in my blood
Ooh girl, you got me twisted
Ooh girl, you got me twisted
