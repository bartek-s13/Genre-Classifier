<<<<<<< HEAD
Now I'm balling I’m in my zone 
Flying round the world I ain't never home 
Yeah I put my team and my family on 
All I really care about is showing love 

I spend everyday staring at the ceiling 
Dreaming of the day when I make my millions
Fucking with this girl got me in my feelings
And people talking shit like they got a reason
And I say fuck the rules I say no more 
Hopping on a plane with my passport 
We came into the city we where cash poor
But now we popping bottles on a sold tour 
Now people wanna say this shit won't last forever 
The same motherfuckers used to tell me never 
Now they wanna act like they don’t remember 
But that's okay, that's okay cause we living better
Day ones, I'm here with my crew 
Got more love for me, then you've got love for you 
We stay up, I ain't going home 
I'm balling I'm in my zone, I’m in my zone 

Now I’m balling I'm in my zone 
Flying round the world I ain’t never home 
Yeah I put my team and my family on 
All I really care about is showing love
And I think, a part of me 
Like hustling, more than sleep
I'm getting on, I'm getting off 
I planned it all, I planned it all
Nother day, same old shit, we be balling 
All this clout, all the chicks got me stalling
All the hype, it be fake it means nothing 
Give me something, give me something 
I'm feeling the weight of the world on my shoulders 
And the money and parties are making me colder
And my mumma be telling me boy that I told ya
Cause you’re getting older, getting closer 
I need somebody, somebody new, somebody real
Who ain't gon judge me who ain't gonna tell me just how I feel 
I need somebody, somebody honest somebody true 
I need somebody like you, woaahh ohhhh
Fake love I'm not fucking with you 
Ain't wasting my time cause Iv got shit to do 
We stay up, I ain't going home 
I'm balling I'm in my zone, I'm in my zone 

Now I'm balling I'm in my zone 
Flying round the world I ain't never home 
Yeah I put my team and my family on 
All I really care about is showing love
And I think, a part of me 
Like hustling, more than sleep
I'm getting on, I'm getting off
