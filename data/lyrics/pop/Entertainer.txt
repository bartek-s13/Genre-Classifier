You thought you had me, didn't you?
When you lied to my face, I could see the truth
Every step of the way I knew
How you fooled me, boo

Guess you didn’t know that
You were my favorite entertainer
I'd watch you, I'd laugh, I would fuck with you
Don’t you take me for a fool
In this game, I own the rules
You were my favorite entertainer
I'd watch you, I'd laugh, I would fake it too
Don't you take me for a fool
I'ma show you a thing or two

Never see me coming, I'll turn you down
When you need me the most, I will turn you
When you need me the most, I will turn you down
Never see me coming, I'll turn you down
When you need me the most, I will turn you
When you need me the most, I will turn you down

Thought that you were smarter, I'm ashamed for you
I knew it right away when you stopped lovin’ me
It happened when your touch wasn’t enough for me

Thought that you should know that
You were my favorite entertainer
I'd watch you, I’d laugh, I would fuck with you
Don't you play me for a fool
In this game, I own the rules
You were my favorite entertainer
I'd watch you, I'd laugh, I would fake it too
Don’t you play me for a fool
I'ma show you a thing or two

Never see me coming, I'll turn you down
When you need me the most, I will turn you
When you need me the most, I will turn you down
Never see me coming, I'll turn you down
When you need me the most, I will turn you
When you need me the most, I will turn you down

Know it's harder to take, and let's face it
No one's playing your games, but let's face it
I'm being straight up
I know fake love when I see it anyway
I'ma turn you down when you need me anyway, anyway, anyway

Never see me coming, I'll turn you down
When you need me the most, I will turn you
When you need me the most, I will turn you down
Never see me coming, I'll turn you down
When you need me the most, I will turn you
When you need me the most, I will turn you down

I know you need me the most
The most, the most (One more time)
