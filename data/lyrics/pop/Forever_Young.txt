I remember when we were kids
They say we got one life, one life to live
And when we grow up we show love
And give all we can give
'Cause we got one life, one life to live

And as the days and nights go by
I never forget, I'll promise I'll remember
That till the day we die
I know you and I gon' keep on singing

As the sun goes up and the sun goes down
We gon' stay the same till our time runs out
'Cause we live to love and we love to live
Where our hearts belong, we're forever young

We're forever young

I remember when we were kids
That we saw magic in the little things
We used to look at the sky as the clouds rolling by
And imagine that we were kings

And as the days and nights go by
I never forget, I'll promise I'll remember
That till the day we die
I know you and I gon' keep on singing
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

As the sun goes up and the sun goes down
We gon' stay the same till our time runs out
'Cause we live to love and we love to live
Where our hearts belong, we're forever young

We're forever young
We're forever young

As the sun goes up and the sun goes down
We gon' stay the same till our time runs out
'Cause we live to love and we love to live
Where our hearts belong, we're forever young
