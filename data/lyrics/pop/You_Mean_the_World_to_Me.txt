The time I thought that we would have
Was taken from red to black
And I said things I can't take back
And I don't know how to live with that

There's a darkness that I've known
And it's shaken me to stone
It kills me you might not know
After all

'Cause I know I don't let you see
But you mean the world to me
And I know that I can be pretty mean
But you mean the world to me

What the hell is wrong with me?
I just sat there and watched you leave
I am not this ice queen
And you think I don't feel anything

There's a fear that I've known
And it's cut you to the bone
And I'm so sorry I've never shown
Just how much you hold

I know I don't let you see
But you mean the world to me
And I know that I can be pretty mean
But you mean the world to me

World to me
World to me

'Cause I know I don't let you see
