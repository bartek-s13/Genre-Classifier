I lost more than track of time
Think I lost my mind, we were up all night
Said we’d reach the satellites
But I didn't know how to do that
I was depending on you

Said you liked me for the flaws
That I know I got, got a couple of
Still, we fall like astronauts
'Cause when I’m with you, I can fall fast
Look what you’re making me do

You make me wanna try harder
Never wanted to, but I want with you
You make me wanna stay longer
Never wanted to, but I want with you

I never knew it could feel like the room started spinning
I never knew it could feel like getting high on just feelings
Before I was numb, but
Don't know what you've done, no
I never knew it could feel like getting high on just feelings
Feelings of us
(High on, high on, get high on)
I never knew I'd get
(High on, high on, get high on)
Feelings of us
(High on, high on, get high on)
I never knew I'd get
(High on, high on, get high on)
Feelings of us

There's so much I want to say
Tell you 'bout my ways, every dumb mistake
But I'm scared you'd walk away
'Cause I need you more than I should now
If only you knew

You make me wanna try harder
Never wanted to, but I want with you
You make me wanna stay longer
Never wanted to, but I want with you

I never knew it could feel like the room started spinning
I never knew it could feel like getting high on just feelings
Before I was numb, but
Don't know what you've done, no
I never knew it could feel like getting high on just feelings
Feelings of us
(High on, high on, get high on)
I never knew I'd get
(High on, high on, get high on)
Feelings of us
(High on, high on, get high on)
I never knew I'd get
(High on, high on, get high on)
Feelings of us

I lost more than track of time
Think I lost my mind, we were up all night
Said we’d reach the satellites
But I didn't know how to do that
I was depending on you
