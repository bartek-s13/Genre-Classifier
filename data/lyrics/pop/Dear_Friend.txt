Dear Friend, how have you been?
I think about you from time to time
Some day, I'd love to know
How you have grown since our last goodbye

I know the world is changing quickly
And I couldn't tell you why
It's beyond my understanding
But I'd love it if we tried
Growing older every moment
Time's falling through my hands
And I don't have to know the meaning
But I'd love to have a chance

These days so much has changed
I stay awake though it's hard sometimes
I'd love to know what you think
Oh, I miss when you'd share what was on your mind

Oh, I just don't know how we'll do it
I leave my window open wide
And as far as I'm concerned
I forget from time to time
I'm so curious about you
I just saw you in my dream
You showed up just to surprise me
And disappeared so suddenly
Apologies for being scattered
I just couldn't go to sleep
I hope you don't think that I'm crazy
If that's really what you think
Sometimes I just feel so helpless
I spend hours in this room
Trying to formulate my feelings
And clear the thought of you
Dear Friend, how have you been?
