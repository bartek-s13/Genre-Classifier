Talk you down
Wasted on the couch
Say what you're feeling now
Don't hold back
Spell it out
Spare me your dirty mouth
Whatever is keeping you here now
Don't let it fade

Caught in a web of your memories
Like the way we would talk, we were seventeen
But I'm losing the feeling that's keeping me
Here now, here now, now

So don't freak out, we're only twenty something
All I know is that with you there's something
So different and that we'll never slow down
Know that we'll never slow down
Lay right here and we can waste away
Trace the corners of your pretty face
All I know is that with you there's something
And that we'll never slow down

What's there to cry about
It's such a shame to see a face like yours
Fall to pieces on the bathroom floor
We can stay up all night 'til you're sure
Oh, it's alright

And if you decided that you don't wanna stay
I won't try and stop you from moving to LA
But know that I still hate it every time you say
"Will you forget about me?"

So don't freak out, we're only twenty something
All I know is that with you there's something
So different and that we'll never slow down
Know that we'll never slow down
Lay right here and we can waste away
Trace the corners of your pretty face
All I know is that with you there's something
And that we'll never slow down

Don't freak out
Don't stop now babe
We're only twenty something
We're only twenty something
Don't freak out
Don't stop now babe
We're only twenty something
We're only twenty something
Don't freak out
Don't stop now babe
We're only twenty something
We're only twenty something
Don't freak out
Don't stop now babe
We're only twenty something
We're only twenty something
