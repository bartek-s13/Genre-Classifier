Just because I wander 'round the places we would go
Hopin' that I'd run into you one last time
Just because I never took your picture off my phone
Doesn't mean that you're still on my mind

Just because I accidentally slip and say your name
When I hear our song, it makes me insecure
Just because I know I'll never ever feel the same
Doesn't mean I love you anymore

Am I lyin' to myself again
When I say you're not the best I've ever had?
Am I lyin' to myself again
When I say that I'm not missing you so bad?

Just because I'm on my knees and swearing I will change
And I'd do anything to hear you say, "I'm yours"
Just because I know I'll never ever feel the same
Doesn't mean I love you anymore

Am I lyin' to myself again
When I say you're not the best I've ever had?
Am I lyin' to myself again
When I say that I'm not missing you so bad?
Just because I'm on my knees and swearing I will change
And do anything to hear you say, "I'm yours"
Just because I know I'll never ever feel the same
Doesn't mean I love you anymore, more
Doesn't mean I love you anymore (Anymore, anymore)
