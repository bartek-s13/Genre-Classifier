Pretty Please
Where do I begin?
Oh, I don't understand it either
And I don't think I can
Fuzzybrain call it what you want
I've felt so distant lately as if I were not

There's rain outside, steady winter
My heart feels like such a mixture
Shapeless, I stare at her picture
I don't know her, but I miss her
Why, oh why such things?

Write it down absent of the pen
The sun has been set for hours and she's rising again
Scattered mind, I call it a friend
I wish I thought a bit less and spoke up instead
In my head

There's rain inside my skeleton frame
A hurricane within my rib cage
I never left but I never stayed
I'm cleaning out the fuzz in my brain
Time and time again
I never left but I never stayed
I'm cleaning out the fuzz in my brain
Time and time again
Oh, it's time and time again
