Ooh that body’s like music to my ear
Ooh that body’s like music to my ear
Ooh that body’s like music to my ear
'Cause what you want is right here

Ooh she, oh she so international
The way, the way she get it on the floor
I’m tryin, I’m tryin’ to holler at you
I wanna get to know you better
Parlez-vous français?
Konichiwa, come and move in my way
Hey, little chica from Guadeloupe
That thing you got behind you is amazing

I don’t speak Spanish, Japanese or French
But the way that body’s talkin’ definitely makes sense
It’s her, her body, her body, her body language
It’s her, her body, her body, her body language
The way she moves around
When she grinds to the beat
Breaking it down articulately
It’s her, her body, her body, her body language
It’s her, her body, her body

Make me wanna say
He-eey, he-eey, he-eey
It’s her, her body, her body
Her body language, come on

I'm lifting up my voice to say
You're the hottest girl in the world today
The way you shake you got me losing my mind
You're banging like a speakerbox
Turn around, the party stops
Universal lady, let me take you away

I don’t speak Spanish, Japanese or French
But the way that body’s talkin’ definitely makes sense
It’s her, her body, her body, her body language
It’s her, her body, her body, her body language
The way she moves around
When she grinds to the beat
Breaking it down articulately
It’s her, her body, her body, her body language
It’s her, her body, her body

That make me wanna say
He-eey, he-eey, he-eey
(Make me wanna say) He-eey, he-eey, he-eey
(Make me wanna say) He-eey, he-eey, he-eey
It’s her, her body, her body, her body language
Her body language, c’mon

Oh that body’s like music to my ear
Oh that body’s like music to my ear
Oh that body’s like music to my ear

Ooh that body’s like music to my ear
