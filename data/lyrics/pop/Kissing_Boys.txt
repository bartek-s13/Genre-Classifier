Didn't know what I was getting myself into
Didn't know that I would go from love to hating you
I wanted to believe in everything that we were gonna do
Didn't know that we would end up with our hearts in two

I told myself today, myself today
I'd change my ways

But I've been busy kissing boys, kissing boys
And I've been treating them like toys, them like toys
When all I really want is you
I close my eyes to fool myself

Never thought that I would end up with a broken heart
From someone that I thought was my everything and my all
Never think that I can give away my heart again
Love has only teared me apart and
I don't think that I will ever mend

I told myself today, myself today
I'd change my ways

But I've been busy kissing boys, kissing boys
And I've been treating them like toys, them like toys
When all I really want is you
I close my eyes to fool myself

I'm the only one getting hurt in this situation
I'm the only one in my head, like I'm on vacation
I'm the only one getting hurt in this situation
I'm the only one in my head, like I'm on vacation

But I've been busy kissing boys, kissing boys
And I've been treating them like toys, them like toys
All I really want is you
I close my eyes to fool myself
But I've been busy kissing boys, kissing boys
And I've been treating them like toys, them like toys
When all I really want is you
I close my eyes to fool myself
I close my eyes to fool myself
