Round round baby, round round
Spinning out on me
I don't need no man
Got my kicks for free
We'll ride still fired on the beat down low
I don't need nobody but my honey's when I go
Round baby, round round spinning out on me
I don't need no man got my kicks for free

When you stare at my face
You're messing with my brain
If you try to convince me then you better think again
If you move to the music, the music's got to give
If it's too complicated that's the way I wanna live
If you hate me I will show you
How to break me into something new
If you want me run away now
If you stop me then I'll hit the ground

And we go, and we go

Round round baby, round round
Spinning out on me
I don't need no man
Got my kicks for free
We'll ride still fired on the beat down low
I don't need nobody but my honey's when I go

Explanations no you don't need one
Having a good time, getting down to fun
And it's your time just tonight he'll be mine then he's gone, yeah yeah
People movin', bodies groovin', never ending
Players are changing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
All you need is a fierce sting
All my girls are here with me
Whiling out they've got their needs
Do you feel me, do you feel me?
Do you feel me, do you feel me?

Round round baby, round round
Spinning out on me
I don't need no man
Got my kicks for free
We'll ride still fired on the beat down low
I don't need nobody but my honey's when I go
Round baby, round round
Spend the night on me
I don't need no man
Got my kicks for free
We'll ride still fired on the beat down low
I don't need nobody but my honeys when I go

Does it hurt when you see how I've done without you?
You thought that I couldn't belong
Never thought that you could be so cruel
All you need is some friends
Won't be by yourself
Let's go round and round and round and round and round

Round round baby, round round
Spinning out on me
I don't need no man
Got my kicks for free
We'll ride still fired on the beat down low
I don't need nobody but my honey's when I go
Round baby, round round
Spend the night on me
I don't need no man
Got my kicks for free
We'll ride still fired on the beat down low
I don't need nobody but my honey's when I go

Round baby, when I go
When I go
When I go
When I go
When I go
When I go
When I go round baby, when I go
When I go
When I go
When I go
When I go
When I go
When I go
