Guilty as sin, just let me in
Baby lets go back in time
For the night
And just relive it, guilty as sin just let me in
Baby its a crime we commit
When my hands
Are touching your body
Close my eyes and i visualize
All the things a wanna do
Things i can do with you
Not so innocent now that no one can see finding it hard to breathe yeah when you're fucking me
Scream out when your back's against the wall
Cause I know what kind of girl you are
That devil look up on your face
We've done some things we can't erase
Scream out when your back's against the wall
Cause I know what kind of girl you are
We've done some things we can't erase, erase, erase
Guilty as sin, just let me in
Baby lets go back in time for the night and just relive it
Guilty as sin, just let me in
Baby its a crime we commit when my hands are touching your body
Guilty as sin, just let me in, just let me in
Baby lets go back in time for the night and just relive it
Guilty as sin, just let me in, oh
Baby its a crime we commit when my hands are touching your body
Put your cigarette down on the table while you inhale it now
No need to put it out
Lipstick stain on the glass of my whiskey cup
I can't get enough, god cannot help us now
Scream out when your back's against the wall
Cause I know what kind of girl you are
That devil look up on your face
We've done some things we can't erase
Scream out when your back's against the wall
Cause I know what kind of girl you are
We've done some things we can't erase, erase, erase
Guilty as sin, just let me in
Baby lets go back in time for the night and just relive it
Guilty as sin, just let me in, just let me in

We got nowhere left to hide ( yeah oh)

Turning water into wine

Baby lets go back in time for the night and just relive it
Guilty as sin, just let me in ( just let me in)
