Look at us
We could paint the perfect picture
About us
From your head to toe I'll fit you
They follow us
Yeah we make 'em think it's fiction
They believe it so I guess it must be real

I can read your mind
I know what you're thinking
I could spend my time
Feeling all the reasons
What they know about us
Doesn't make a difference
Baby, we got us
We on something different

We on something, something, some
We on something different
We on something, something, some
We on something different
We on something, something, some
We on something different
We on something, something, some
We on something different

In a rush
Even though we young, we flexin'
We fall in love
About a hundred times a day
Like it's not enough
Yeah we make 'em think it's fiction
They believe it so I guess it must be real

I can read your mind
I know what you're thinking
I could spend my time
Feeling all the reasons
What they know about us
Doesn't make a difference
Baby, we got us
We on something different

We on something, something, some
We on something different
We on something, something, some
We on something different
We on something, something, some
We on something different
We on something, something, some
