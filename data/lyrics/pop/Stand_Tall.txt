Stand tall for a lifetime
You got more, you got more to give
And I hope for a lifeline
You'll be here to bring up your kids

I don't know what to say to you
To get it through your head
You are watering your roots
With every tear that's shed
We won't wait for a better day, this one will do
At the bottom of everything is a beautiful view

If your light goes out tonight, it will end up in the sky
But my star it's not your time, it's not your time
And we'll wish up upon you
And you'll wish down on us too
But your time is not tonight, it's not tonight, it's not tonight!

Stand tall for a lifetime
You got more, you got more to give
And I hope for a lifeline
You'll be here to bring up your kids
Stand tall for a lifetime
You got more, you got more to give
And I hope for a lifeline
You'll be here to bring up your kids
Bring up your kids

Now here's the thing with a broken heart:
More pieces to share
So when everything falls apart
There's beauty in the tear
We won't wait for a better day, to help you pull through
At the bottom of everything, I'll be there with you

If your light goes out tonight, it will end up in the sky
But my star it's not your time, I need you shining here in mine
And we'll wish up upon you
And you'll wish down on us too
But your time is not tonight, its not tonight, its not tonight!

Stand tall for a lifetime
You got more, you got more to give
And I hope for a lifeline, you'll be here to bring up your kids
Stand tall for a lifetime
You got more, you got more to give
And I hope for a lifeline, you'll be here to bring up your kids

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
It's not tonight! It's not tonight! It's not tonight! It's not tonight!
It's not tonight! It's not tonight! It's not tonight! Never tonight!

Stand tall for a lifetime
You got more, you got more to give
And I hope for a lifeline, you'll be here to bring up your kids
Stand tall for a lifetime
You got more, you got more to give
