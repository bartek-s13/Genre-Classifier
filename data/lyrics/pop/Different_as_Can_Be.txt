I've got a problem with the way you sleep!
(sung)
You won't sleep on your tummy

You won't sleep on your back

We're quite a kooky couple you'll agree

We share some hands and fingers

And yet the feeling lingers

We're just about as different
As anyone can be

You like plotting a garden
And I like plotting to kill
You think that you should rule the world
I think books are a thrill!
Sipping tea by the fire is swell

Pushing people in is fun as well!
I like folding all my ties
And you have no friends
Hey, that's a surprise 
Hey!
I guess it's plain to see
When you look at you and me
We're different
Different
As can be

You're a sissy, a twat, a girl!
I'm the darkest of lords!

I'm the brightest twat we've got here
I've won several awards!
My new world is about to unfold

You got beat by a two-year-old

I'll kill him this time, through and through

Or you might just give him another tattoo

You really must agree
When you look at you and me
We're different
Different
As can-

I'll rise again and I'll rule the world
But you must help me renew

Me?
For when our plan succeeds -

Prevails?!

Part of that world goes to you

When I rule the world, I'll plant flowers

When I rule the world, I'll have... snakes!
And goblins and Thestrals
A fleet of Dementors
And giants and werewolves
And all my Death Eaters!
 
And Jane Austin novels!
When I rule the world!
I guess it's plain to see
When you look at you and me
We're
Different
Different
As can be
We simply guarantee
When you look at you and me
We're
Different
Different
As can be

It's a comedy of sorts
When you're bounds to Voldemort!

You're making me blush!
(sung)
And I'm happy as a squirrel
'long as I'm with Mr. Quirrell!

What a ham!

We'll lead him to slaughter
And we'll murder Harry Potter!
We're different
Different
Different, different
As can be!

Ahh!
