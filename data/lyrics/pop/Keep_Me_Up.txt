My heart starts beating and my hands start sweating
My chest starts sinking and sometimes will even start shaking
It's physical and emotional
(And it's hard)

You're keeping me awake at night
I'm losing all my appetite
My heart is beating out of time
My skin is cold, my chest is tight
You're keeping me awake at night

And I don't want you all inside my head
And I can feel you running through my veins

When I say, and I say, and I say that
"I want you in my life"
But you stay, and you stay, and you stay
And you never leave my side
And you take, and you take, and you take
And you say you feel so nice, boy
And you keep me up all night
No, I say, and I say, and I say
"I don't want you in my life"
But you stay, and you stay, and you stay
And you never leave my side
And you take, and you take, and you take
And you say you feel so nice, boy
(And you keep me up all night)
My mind keeps looking for a way
To find somebody else to blame
The silence's screaming way too loud
I need something to dim it down
To find a way to block the sound

And I don't want you all inside my head
And I can feel you running through my veins

When I say, and I say, and I say that
"I want you in my life"
But you stay, and you stay, and you stay
And you never leave my side
And you take, and you take, and you take
And you say you feel so nice, boy
And you keep me up all night
No, I say, and I say, and I say
"I don't want you in my life"
But you stay, and you stay, and you stay
And you never leave my side
And you take, and you take, and you take
And you say you feel so nice, boy
And you keep me up all night
Keep me up all night, boy, keep me up all night
Keep me up all night, boy, keep me up all night
Keep me up all night, boy, keep me up all night
Keep me up all night, boy, keep me up all night

When I say, and I say, and I say that
"I want you in my life"
But you stay, and you stay, and you stay
And you never leave my side
And you take, and you take, and you take
And you say you feel so nice, boy
And you keep me up all night
No, I say, and I say, and I say
"I don't want you in my life"
But you stay, and you stay, and you stay
And you never leave my side
And you take, and you take, and you take
And you say you feel so nice, boy
And you keep me up all night

If I knew why, maybe it would all just go away
I don't think anyone really knows why
But we do go on
And we do understand that you can't always understand
And that's okay too
