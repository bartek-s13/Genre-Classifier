(Come on and move your body)
(Come on and move your body)

We've been killing time
Just tryna to skip that nine to five, that nine to five
Restless happy souls
Not soldiers doing what we're told
Yeah, what we're told

Don't make me wait out in the line
I know a guy who knows a guy
He swore I'd get in
I'm with the band, I'm in the show
Haven't you heard, yeah don't you know
Everyone's my friend

All the young fools, we're starving in the back
Credit card shoes, we're weekend millionaires
Just tryna be cool, yeah one day we'll be there
'Til Monday comes again
We're weekend millionaires
Weekend millionaires, one day we'll be there
Weekend millionaires, one day we'll be there
Out of food again, and we're ten blocks from H&amp;M
We turn in five of them
Empty bank account, if my old friends could see me now
Look at me now

Don't make me wait out in the line
I know a guy who knows a guy
He swore I'd get in
I'm with the band, I'm in the show
Haven't you heard, yeah don't you know
Everyone's my friend

All the young fools, we're starving in the back
Credit card shoes, we're weekend millionaires
Just tryna be cool, yeah one day we'll be there
'Til Monday comes again
We're weekend millionaires
Weekend millionaires, one day we'll be there
Weekend millionaires, one day we'll be there
(Come on and move your body)
(Come on and move your body)
(Come on and move your body)
(Come on and move your body)
We just want the good life
Make it on a part time
Take it up on cloud nine
Never coming down
Put me in the best light
Yeah I'm looking just right
Gotta get my good side
Gotta get my good side

All the young fools, we're starving in the back
Credit card shoes, we're weekend millionaires
Just tryna be cool, yeah one day we'll be there
'Til Monday comes again
We're weekend millionaires
Weekend millionaires, one day we'll be there
