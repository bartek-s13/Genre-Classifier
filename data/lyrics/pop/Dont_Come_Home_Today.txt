I could laugh about
All the things I'm trying out
But what's the point in that
If you're not supporting them
And who cares
Where you have gone today
And who cares
Well I guess they won't be telling you anyway
I could laugh about
All the things I'm trying out
But what's the point
The point in that
Where you have gone today
(Oh no)
And who cares
If you don't come home anyway
And who cares
If you didn't come, don't come home today
And who cares
Nobody's gonna miss you anyway
(Oh no)
