I like to think that when I'm alone
And when you aren't here
That I am strong and when you are weak
I can do it better
I can do it better
Tell me where will it start
When will it all go to dark
When can I stand up on my own
And be who i want

'Cause I can do it better
I can do it better
I can do it better

I can't leave you
I don't want this constant war
You left me broken
From high enough to just face down on the floor
After all we've been through
We've been better off apart
Oh 'cause you and me and i knew that from the start
You knew you'd break my heart
I can do it better
I can do it better
I can do it better
I can do it better
I can do it better
You can't do it better, no
