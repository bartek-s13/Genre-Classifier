Hold up
I can be the one to tell you
You moved to California for the dream the music gave you
I know you can't get up off the xan
Now I made a little money
Gonna come in town to save you

I've been working all night
Baby, when I come home can't be alone
I popped a pill and now I'm rolling
I don't wanna be high on my own
So, baby, ride the wave
I can see in your eyes that you like it
Just feel the moment but don't try to fight it
Fuck me all night, baby
When you wake up I'mma be gone

We're not good together
Got some things we gotta do before we can coexist
And I've been living life too fast for love
No, I cannot resist
What you need's to be saved
Oh, girl, I'm so far away
I got a lot on my mind
And I don't think I'll be there for you everytime you call
Oh, girl, we might as well try

I've been working all night
Baby, when I come home can't be alone
I popped a pill and now I'm rolling
I don't wanna be high on my own
So, baby, ride the wave
I can see in your eyes that you like it
Just feel the moment but don't try to fight it
Fuck me all night, baby
When you wake up I'mma be gone

Hold on
Two more days without creations
No, we miscommunicated
Keep the room illuminated
So done
Need no other explanations
Yeah, you dreaming 'bout a life
Oh, you can keep up elevating
I've been waiting
So whats gon keep me high
What's gon keep you in my life
Baby, fuck that other guy
No, you belong with me, yeah
No ballad and no veil
Hold me down right by my side
Baby, it's ok to cry
Know one day we'll be free, yeah

I've been working all night
Baby, when I come home can't be alone
I popped a pill and now I'm rolling
I don't wanna be high on my own
So, baby, ride the wave
I can see in your eyes that you like it
Just feel the moment but don't try to fight it
Fuck me all night, baby
When you wake up I'mma be gone
I've been working all night
Baby, when I come home can't be alone
(I can't be alone, shawty, I can't be alone)
I popped a pill and now I'm rolling
I don't wanna be high on my own
(Don't wanna be high on my own)
So, baby, ride the wave
I can see in your eyes that you like it
Just feel the moment but don't try to fight it
Fuck me all night, baby
When you wake up I'mma be gone
