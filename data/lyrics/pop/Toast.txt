Oh mamma, mamma, I've been sad most of my life
Since you left me, there is not much left to love
But I've been thinking, I think it's time to cheer things up
Oh lover, lover, you taught me loads about this heart
Like why our ribs they look a lot like prison bars
But I've been thinking, I think it's time to cheer things up in here

So let's toast for all the bad times
Toast for all the hard nights
Toast for all the douch bags that's been breaking our hearts
Toast for too much feelings
Toast for all our demons
Cause honey bunny, one day we'll be gone
So we better toast

Oh papa, papa you I can't just shake things of
But I see the lows now, as a trampoline straight up
Cause I've been thinking, I think it's time to live for once

So let's toast for all the bad times
Toast for all the hard nights
Toast for all the douch bags that's been breaking our hearts
Toast for too much feelings
Toast for all our demons
Cause honey bunny, one day we'll be gone
So we better toast

Toast for bad times
Toast for love
Toast for douch bags that's been causing us this heartache
Toast for fathers that let you down
Then send you pictures of his new kids on your birthday
Pictures of his new kids on your birthday
Cheers for those!
