I hate that we're sleepless now
I hate we don't talk things out
I hate that there's a thousand miles from my side to your side
Words don't come easily
When you've got your back to me
Now there's a space too wide that's left us with wondering eyes
Ah, ah

Why don't your touch feel like it used to do?
Is it because I got used to you?
Why don't your touch feel like it used to do?
Is it because I got used to you?
I'm missing my heart race
And how your kisses were my favourite taste
But nothing's feeling like it used to do
Is it because I got used to you?

Is there a pill we can take
To lift us to a higher place?
So that our love don't fade
And make our touch feel the same
I look back on those first nights
We laid under those blue skies
Eight days, I'm losing time
Only you on my mind
Oh, I was so lost in your brown eyes
Why don't your touch feel like it used to do?
Is it because I got used to you?
Why don't your touch feel like it used to do?
Is it because I got used to you?
I'm missing my heart race
And how your kisses were my favourite taste
But nothing's feeling like it used to do
Is it because I got used to you?
Is it because I got used to you?

Was I addicted to the rush?
Was I in love, or loved the lust?
'Cause now when I look at you
I don't know what is real
What if I open up to you and you thought about it, too?
Have you thought about it, too?
Then nothing's feeling like it used to

Why don't your touch feel like it used to do?
Is it because I got used to you?
Why don't your touch feel like it used to do?
Is it because I got used to you?
I'm missing my heart race
And how your kisses were my favourite taste
But nothing's feeling like it used to do
Is it because I got used to you?
Is it because I got used to you?
I never thought I'd get used to you
I never thought I'd get used to you
