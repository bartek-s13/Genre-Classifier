It's more what you are
Than what you might've been
It's all that you are
Restart everything
Too soon
It's always too soon
It suits you
And it's still half true
It caught
It caught my eye
It was borderline
Peace of mind
It cost more than you thought
You should definitely try
To find your peace of mind
Did it sneak up beside you?
If it follows you around and it's making you down
And you giving it more than it brings
And it's pulling up everything
You're thinking things you don't wanna think of
If it follows you around
If it's dragging you down and you're giving it more than it brings
You can rearrange everything
It won't stay the same nothing is everlasting
It's just passing
If you're asking
It's true
It caught
It caught my eye
And it was borderline
Peace of mind
It cost more than you thought
You should definitely try to find
Your peace of mind
Just needed the time to grow
But probably not together though
All of them telling you go
When you know you'll know
Somebody will if others don't
It's only harder till you go blindfolded
Everything is possible
