I will fight, I will fight for you
I always do until my heart is black and blue
And I will stay, I will stay with you
We'll make it to the other side like lovers do

I'll reach my hands out in the dark and
Wait for yours to interlock
I'll wait for you, I'll wait for you

'Cause I'm not givin' up
I'm not givin' up, givin' up, no, not yet (Not yet)
Even when I'm down on my last breath (Last breath)
Even when they say there's nothin' left (Nothin' left)
So don't give up on
I'm not givin' up
I'm not givin' up, givin' up, no, not me (Not me)
Even when nobody else believes (Believes)
I'm not goin' down that easily
So don't give up on me

And I will hold, I'll hold onto you
No matter what this world will throw
It won't shake me loose
I'll reach my hands out in the dark and
Wait for yours to interlock
I'll wait for you, I'll wait for you

'Cause I'm not givin' up
I'm not givin' up, givin' up, no, not yet (Not yet)
Even when I'm down on my last breath (Last breath)
Even when they say there's nothin' left (Nothin' left)
So don't give up on
I'm not givin' up
I'm not givin' up, givin' up, no, not me (Not me)
Even when nobody else believes (Believes)
I'm not goin' down that easily
So don't give up on me

I will fight, I will fight for you
I always do until my heart is black and blue
