Ooh, na-na, yeah
Don't act like you know me, like you know me, na-na, yeah

Oh, yeah, time is money so don't fuck with mine
See I'm out with my girls, I'ma have a good time
Step back with your chit-chat, killin' my vibe
Oh, oh, woah, oh, ah

See, I can't get too much of a good thing, mmm
S'why me a dressed up in the finest things, woah
Please hold your tongue, don't say a damn thing

See your iPhone camera flashin'

"You here for long?" "Oh no, I'm just passin'"
"Do you wanna drink?" "Nah, thanks for askin'"

But it doesn't mean you're in my circle, yeah

Cruise through life and I'm feelin' on track
If you can't keep up, then you better fall back, uh
'Cause money look better when I see it all stacked up
