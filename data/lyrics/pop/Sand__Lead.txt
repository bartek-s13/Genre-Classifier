Find me at the water's edge if you wanna
See you on the ocean bed if you're gonna
Fill my boots with sand and lead if you wanna
Fill my boots with sand and lead
Shall I bring the torch to kill the shadows?
I'll take the wheel if you do the pedals
Bobble back and forth, the spirit levels
Fill my boots with sand and lead

Who do you hold on to
When we're passing through
And the air so fine?

As the city sleeps, we can all be free
Will you follow or break away?
Simple even sea, whispers on the beach
Will you follow or break away?

Find me at the water's edge if you wanna
See you on the ocean bed if you're gonna
Fill my boots with sand and lead if you wanna
Fill my boots with sand and lead
Who do you hold on to
When we're passing through
And the air so fine?

As the city sleeps, we can all be free
Will you follow or break away?
Simple even sea, whispers on the beach
Will you follow or break away?
