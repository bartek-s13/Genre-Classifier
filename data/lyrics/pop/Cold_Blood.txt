Lying on a cold bed
Thinkin' 'bout what you said
Doesn't take a lot to feel
You were just a victim
Caught up in the drama
Of things you know you couldn't fix
So if you want to hurt somebody
If you want to break somebody
If you need a hand to bare the weight
I'll be the one
I could never leave you lonely
Even when it gets too hard
I could never kiss you only
In cold blood
You could never say it's easy
Knowing we've come so far
We could never live completely
In cold blood
In cold blood
I know I'm not an angel
But the Devil's in the details
And I'm waiting for my wounds to heal
And you are always right there
Every time I need ya
Patient when I move too fast
But if you want to hold somebody
If you want to love somebody
If you want a heart to guide the way
I'll be the one
Oh oh ooh
I could never leave you lonely
Even when it gets too hard
I could never kiss you only
In cold blood
You could never say it's easy
Knowing we have come so far
We could never live completely
In cold blood
In cold blood
Baby can we
Yea yea
In cold blood
It could be easy
Yea yea
In cold blood
Baby
Can we
Warm up our broken bodies
It could be easy
