If I left you to your own devices
Would you take off all alone somewhere new
Don’t dwell on what you think could divide us
Let this be between me and you

All of the better things are in your head
All of the better things are in this bed
In this bed

Don’t you know its mysterious
How you look for new things all the time
You couldn’t make it more obvious
Telling me you’re just alright

You’re just alright
You’re just alright
You’re just alright
You’re just alright
You’re just alright
Without me

All of the better things are in your head
All of the better things are in this bed
In this bed
