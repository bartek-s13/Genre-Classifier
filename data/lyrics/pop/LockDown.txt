Something inside me changes
My whole mind rearranges
Energy so contagious
It's so contagious
Got me actin' so stupid
Just one look and I lose it
Tell me, why do you do it?
How do you do it?

Sometimes I want to give it up to ya, baby
Sometimes I just don't give a
One day I might just give it up to ya, baby
But right now I just don't give a
If we goin' in, no doubt
We might not make it out
I'm not in my feels right now
So, baby, you should know

If you're lookin' for my heart, let go
If you feel like getting close, don't fall
'Cause the minute that we touch, locked down
Yeah the minute that we touch, locked down
I ain't tryna feel my heart break, no
I might never wanna let you go
'Cause the minute that we touch, locked down
Yeah the minute that we touch, locked down
Ooh, ooh, locked down
Ooh, ooh
Tell me you got someone else
Tell me you got someone else
Talk to me, make it easy for me to not go there
Hard for me to not go there
Honestly, honestly
You might even kiss and tell
And I don't wanna play myself
You know how we are
We'll take it too far

Sometimes I want to give it up to ya, baby
Sometimes I just don't give a
One day I might just give it up to ya, baby
But right now I just don't give a
If we goin' in, no doubt
We might not make it out
I'm not in my feels right now
Baby, you should know

If you're lookin' for my heart, let go
If you feel like getting close, don't fall
'Cause the minute that we touch, locked down
Yeah the minute that we touch, locked down
I ain't tryna feel my heart break, no
I might never wanna let you go
'Cause the minute that we touch, locked down
Yeah the minute that we touch, locked down
Ooh, ooh, locked down
Ooh, ooh
Yeah the minute, the minute
Ooh, ooh
'Cause the minute that we touch, locked down
Yeah the minute that we touch, locked down
I would rather just forget you
But I always seem to let you back in
Wish we never let it happen
But we always let it happen
I don't mean to be cold
But I don't wanna get close
I wanna give up but you still hold on
If you're lookin' for my heart
If you feel like getting close, don't

If you're lookin' for my heart, let go
If you feel like getting close, don't fall
'Cause the minute that we touch, locked down
Yeah the minute that we touch, locked down (Ayy, ayy)
I ain't tryna feel my heart break, no
I might never wanna let you go
'Cause the minute that we touch, locked down
Yeah the minute that we touch, locked down
Oh, if you're lookin' for my heart
Ooh, ooh, locked down
Ooh, ooh
Yeah the minute, the minute
Ooh, ooh
'Cause the minute that we touch, locked down
Yeah the minute that we touch, locked down
Locked down
