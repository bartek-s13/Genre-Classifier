I came to cash checks
I wanna stack more gold than Aztecs
Less the gold got me saying God bless to the Visa and American Express
Watch, now make it rain go on, hold your green up
Players gonna say when we blow the scene up
All eyes on me, go and light the night
I tell 'em here go swipe the stripe
Tell 'em

Mia Khalifa, Mia Khalifa, Mia Khalifa, Mia Khalifa

Credit or debit, I get it
I bet it, I double the money and spread it
Watch it rain and fall like confetti
No never regret it
I said it, I'm in it for even a second
As soon as I get it, well you know I'mma spend it
It's like bang
Now watch it stack up
Game like this make you wanna pack up
Know she got dumps like a truck, beep, beep, beep
God damn, let her watch you back up
Okay, now let's go and get it on from New York to the Bay
All the way to Lebanon
Sometimes you gotta make a decision
Took her talents around the world now she ballin' like Lebron, ay
Got me thinking like olay
So play in Beirut? Nah, I'm just fillin' my Rosé
Girl I wonder what you try for
I put you in positions you don't even need to apply for
Mia Khalifa, Mia Khalifa, Mia Khalifa, Mia Khalifa

Can't see got my eyes on tint
Got the cash flow comin' like I'm straight out the mint
Woke up like where the fuck my money went?
Must have been a good time, now that's money well spent
Khalifa, teacher, haters need ya
Reefer blowin' now, right up out the speakers
I get no respect like I'm here singing with Aretha
Got me goin' in, let me do my own feature

Mia Khalifa, Mia Khalifa, Mia Khalifa, Mia Khalifa
