They only wanna talk when you doing well
They don't know the past, we all been going through hell
Where were you when this was just a little pipe dream?
I don't know the cloud of doubt that's coming over me

Maybe they all think they know what's better for me
Made a couple candles, spill it on the sink
Drink another bottle, I don't care what they think
Guess I'm just another kid with rips in his jeans
But you know I got a plan
Baby, hold on to my hand
I don't know if they my friend
You could rip all my clothes and I don't mind that it's cold
'Cause now I know that I can feel something again

Maybe they all think they know what's better for me
Made a couple candles, spill it on the sink
Drink another bottle, I don't care what they think
Guess I'm just another kid with rips in his jeans
But you know I'm gonna live for the moment
So much pressure, feeling like I'ma fold it
Oh, I know the winter time is the coldest
All the money in the world is gonna come and go
I guess I gotta sit down and focus
Sometimes I just feel like I'm running
I'm just out here searching for something
Tapping, all my fingers are drums
I got a heart of gold
If I don't got this dream I got nothing
And I've been popping a lotta pills lately
You just feel my back for my safety
But I've been living life right on the edge of my mind
And only now they wanna congratulate me

Maybe they all think they know what's better for me
(You been up in my mind)
Made a couple candles, spill it on the sink
(I think I will be fine)
Drink another bottle, I don't care what they think
(I got nothing but time)
Guess I'm just another kid with rips in his jeans
But you know I got a plan
(I don't want you to know)
Baby, hold on to my hand
(That I've been feeling so low)
I don't know if they my friend
(I've been out on the road)
You could rip all my clothes and I don't mind that it's cold
(Know we might as well go)
'Cause now I know that I can feel something again
