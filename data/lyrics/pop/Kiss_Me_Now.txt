My dinner's getting cold but your eyes are
(On fire, on fire)
How does everything taste like heaven?
(You're a liar, a liar)
Your drink is warm it's been a while
Sipping on ginger ale and water
I'm running out of re-fills baby
(I'm tired, I'm tired)

We're sitting at the red light and I don't wanna stare
But there's really only one thing on my mind

So kiss me now before I go
You got a chance so won't you take it, take it, take it
You broken boy
Because I feel like this is going well
So why the hell you moving so damn slow?
I know we might not last forever
But if you don't try I guess we'll never know
So kiss me now before I

Cut to the chase I'm over the small talk
(Just shut up, shut up)
Last call is in front of you're running out of luck
(Don't give up, don't give up)
I thought that I had enough of the fakes, and the lust and the weather
But you look like a glimpse of summer
We're walking through the gallery and it all looks the same
But I look over my shoulder Frida Kahlo knows my pain
And all this tension gives me hell
I'm not one to kiss and tell
But the best things there's one thing on my mind

So kiss me now before I go
You got a chance so won't you take it, take it, take it
You broken boy
Because I feel like this is going well
So why the hell you moving so damn slow?
I know we might not last forever
But if you don't try I guess we'll never know
So kiss me now before I

I'm giving you one more chance
I'm giving you one more dance
I'm giving you just another second to see it through
I'm giving you one last look
I bet you think that you're lucky
But honey I'm always on the move
I'm giving you one more chance
I'm giving you one more dance
I'm giving you just another second to see it through
I'm giving you one last look
I bet you think that you're lucky
But honey I'm always on the move
So kiss me now before I go
You got a chance so won't you take it, take it, take it
You broken boy
Because I feel like this is going well
So why the hell you moving so damn slow?
I know we might not last forever
But if you don't try I guess we'll never know
So kiss me now before I
