<<<<<<< HEAD
You're the lines on the tarmac
Rainy days and we take it to the carpet
Skinned knees on the gravel where we sat
Wide-eyed, a coming of age
A year older every day
We grew up without looking back

Promises and tight grips
Now we're here and they're bound to slip
Is it wrong that part of me feels cheated?
Now I wish I understood
I traded easiness for adulthood at the surface
We got what we wanted

But now we like the taste of caffeine
And now you are too busy for me
But this is everything we wanted
This is everything we wanted
And maybe you will make an effort
And maybe the memories are better
Cause this is everything we wanted
Is this everything we wanted?
(Too fast, too much, too soon)

I remember all the pledges
We were certain that the bond was the constant
On the verge of resolution, we were sure
Parting ways, near and fast
I never thought it wouldn't last
Can we avoid being getting cut too short?

Promises and tight grips
Now we're here and they're bound to slip
Is it wrong that part of me feels cheated?
Now I wish I understood, I
Traded easiness for adulthood at the surface
We got what we wanted

But now we like the taste of caffeine
And now you are too busy for me
But this is everything we wanted
This is everything we wanted
And maybe you will make an effort
And maybe the memories are better
Cause this is everything we wanted
Is this everything we wanted?
(Too fast, too much, too soon)

Oh it's bittersweet (Too fast, too much, too soon)
Almost what I thought it'd be (Too fast, too much, too soon)
But it's alright (Too fast, too much, too soon)
My mind is occupied (Too fast, too much, too soon)
We left each other out (Too fast, too much, too soon)
We planned each other out (Too fast, too much, too soon)
And now the knots untie (Too fast, too much, too soon)
And now the talks run dry (Too fast, too much, too soon)

(Too fast, too much, too soon)

But now we like the taste of caffeine
And now you are too busy for me
But this is everything we wanted
This is everything we wanted (This is everything we wanted)
And maybe you will make an effort
And maybe the memories are better
Cause this is everything we wanted (This is everything we wanted)
Is this everything we wanted?
(Too fast, too much, too soon)
(Too fast, too much, too soon)
(Too fast, too much, too soon)
