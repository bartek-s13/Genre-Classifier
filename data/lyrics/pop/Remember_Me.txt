I heard the sirens call
It made me feel alive
Thought I could take it all
Thought that I could survive
You told me it was storming
I knew I should've stayed
But I ignored the warning
Now I'm caught out in the rain

Day after day I get lost in this ocean
I kick and I scream and I drown in emotion
Time after time I refuse to surrender
If I don't make it out alive, will you remember me?
Remember me

And if I come undone
What have I left behind
Was there a smoking gun
That made me lose my mind
Or will it really matter
If I check out this way
Will you just end up hating
The ghost of what I became
Day after day I get lost in this ocean
I kick and I scream and I drown in emotion
Time after time I refuse to surrender
If I don't make it out alive, will you remember me?
Day after day I get lost in this ocean
I kick and I scream and I drown in emotion
Time after time I refuse to surrender
If I don't make it out alive, will you remember me?

Remember me
Remember me
