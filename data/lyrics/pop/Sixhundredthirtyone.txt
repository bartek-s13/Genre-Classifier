Your eyes stare back as I dream of death
They call to speak your name
It's just wasted
Your eyes stare back as I dream of death
They call to speak your name
It's just wasted breath
When your lungs empty and nothing escapes your lips
The heart grows cold and ill finally sleep
The thought torments me
How empty I feel
Seeing you alive
Seeing you alive
I raise the knife guided slow towards your light
How many times will I turn
What more can I think?
I've felt every mistake
I've seen every catastrophe
How many times must I say
How many times must I say it
You've died in my eyes
Hoping for an end
The end
Your eyes stare back as I dream of death
They call to speak your name
