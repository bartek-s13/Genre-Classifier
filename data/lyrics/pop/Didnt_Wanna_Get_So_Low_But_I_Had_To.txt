I go back to where I am losing
Lying down and I can't stand it
You cannot lose it when you knew it
All along through me
On my own through me
On my own

I didn't hear it when you said it
On my own, that I would like it
I guess I'll leave you when I'm leaving
My poor, poor soul, through me
On my own through me
On my own

Oh, I feel it going down
When I'm home I'm not around
Oh, I feel it going down
When I'm home I'm not around

All of this crying for a reason
Well it's all gone and I can taste it
And of the time that I spent losing
It's on my own, through me
On my own through me
On my own
Oh, I feel it going down
When I'm home I'm not around
Oh, I feel it going down
When I'm home I'm not around
Uh uh uh uh
Uh uh uhh
Uh uh uh uh
Uh uh uhh

Didn't want to get so low but I had to
I didn't want to get so low but I had to
I didn't want to get so low but I had to
I didn't want to get so low but I had to

And I'm losing lying down
Yeah, losing lying down, oh oh oh oh oh oh
Put me down
Well I'm losing lying down, oh oh oh oh oh oh

So low but I had to
I didn't want to get so low but I had to
I didn't want to get so low but I had to
I didn't want to get so low but I had to
Uh uh uh uh uh
Uh uh uhh
Uh uh uh uh
Uh uh uhh
