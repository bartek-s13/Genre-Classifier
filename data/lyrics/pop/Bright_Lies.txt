The same hoping
We're hoping for a dark cold winter sun
My body is bitter cold
My mind is overthrown
Since the world is full of roles that we play
And as long as we do there's no time to regret
All the ways how you and I had come together

Bright lies shine on
Illusions past ages ago
From a distance
See my self existing
Pretend to feel your undertow
You see bright lies, they shine on
Illusions past ages ago
From a distance
See my self existing
Pretend to feel your undertow

Ophelia, I leave my broken bones in the desert
Ophelia, I leave my broken bones in the desert

You wouldn't tell if you go there
You wouldn't tell if you go there
You wouldn't tell if you go there
You wouldn't tell if you go there
You wouldn't tell if you go there
You wouldn't tell if you go there
You wouldn't tell if you go there
You wouldn't tell if you go there

Still the world is full of roles we play
Oh, maybe love is enough
