Nothing you say will ever be wrong
'Cause it does, it feels good being in your arms
And I'm running with you as fast as I can
Singing to myself, "I Want to Hold Your Hand"

And we're going downtown
Because we feel like running around
Is it really this fun when you're on my mind?
Is it really this cool to be in your life?

There's one thing I'll do if it ever goes wrong
I'll write you into all of my songs
And if suddenly I die, I hope they will say
That he was obsessed and it was okay

'Cause we ain't going downtown
And we feel like running around
Is it really this fun when you're on my mind?
Is it really this cool to be in your life?

And I'm going crazy, crazy for you
And I'm going crazy, crazy for you
I'm going crazy, crazy for you
And I'm going crazy, crazy for you
I'm...
