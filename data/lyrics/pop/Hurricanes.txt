I wanna wake up with your weight by my side
And I wanna think that you look good as you rise
And I wanna turn to you, turn around by your side
And I wanna think, but not to say

Let me face the sound and fury
Let me face hurricanes

And I wanna see you as you walk through the door
And time will make us, some ways less and some ways more
And I wanna talk of nothing as the world passes by
And I wanna think, but not to say

Let me face the sound and fury
Let me face hurricanes

Let me not turn away
From happiness or pain
Just not to run away
In my heart and in my head
Let me face hurricanes
Hurricanes
Hurricanes
Hurricanes
Hurricanes
Hurricanes

Let me face the sound and fury
Let me face hurricanes
Let me face the sound and fury
Let me face hurricanes

Hurricanes
