Floating along, hippopotamus hunting
The beast gets what he deserves
Fall in to bed with the daughters of Jezebel
And dream of Athenians
There's a hole in the sky
That the birds fly through
And I want to fly too
Oh I want to fly too
There's a hole in the sky
That the birds fly through
And I want to fly too
Oh I want to fly to ya'
Children get out, out of the buildings
Get out of the buildings and into the fields
Young faces turn to the sky as the planes appear
Future is yesterday, yesterday's coming
There's a hole in the sky
That the birds fly through
And I want to fly too
Oh I want to fly too
There's a hole in the sky
That the birds fly through
And I want to fly too
Oh I want to fly too
Everybody wants to be beautiful
Everybody wants to be on their way home
There's a hole in the sky
That the birds fly through
And I want to fly too
Oh I want to fly too
There's a hole in the sky
There's a hole in the sky
There's a hole in the sky
