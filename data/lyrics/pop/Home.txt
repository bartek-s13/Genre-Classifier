I know it's you
When the fire burn
It is written in the flames
I hear it too
In the ocean breeze
It is calling out your name

This must be true
Oh, I believe I do
This must be true
When the sun goes down
All I think about is you

Oh, I wanna be there with you
'Cause you make me feel like I'm home
Memories in my mind
Yeah you make me feel like home
If I could turn back time
I would never let you go
I would never let you go
'Cause you make me feel like I'm home
Yeah you make me feel like home
'Cause you make me feel like I'm home
 still glows
Know you feel it too
There is time to make it right
A wilted rose
Get to red again
Please come light up the night

This must be true
Oh, I believe I do
This must be true
When the sun goes down
All I think about is you

Oh, I wanna be there with you
'Cause you make me feel like I'm home
Memories in my mind
Yeah you make me feel like home
If I could turn back time
I would never let you go
I would never let you go
'Cause you make me feel like I'm home
Yeah you make me feel like home
'Cause you make me feel like I'm home
Something in the wind that tells me
We can be alive
Reminds me of all of our summer nights
Down on Route 65
If I could turn back time
I would never let you go
I would never let you go

Oh, I wanna be there with you
'Cause you make me feel like I'm home
Memories in my mind
Yeah you make me feel like home
If I could turn back time
I would never let you go
I would never let you go

'Cause you make me feel like I'm home
Yeah you make me feel like home
