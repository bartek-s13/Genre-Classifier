Flowers through the pavement
Find a way to break
You don’t have to say it
Gotta be this way
‘Cause I believe in breaking down walls
And I’m still here to catch you if you fall

All I know is you’re not showing who you truly are
My arms open up in hoping you’ll unlock your heart
You’ve got some secrets you don’t need to tell
You got some pain yeah I got some myself
If nothing else, we can share our broken parts

Shadows under streetlights
We’re fading away
To another late night
Turning into days
Where we fell into morning so slow
Starry eyes I’ll follow where you go

All I know is you’re not showing who you truly are
My arms open up in hoping you’ll unlock your heart
You’ve got some secrets you don’t need to tell
You got some pain yeah I got some myself
If nothing else, we can share our broken parts
We can share our broken parts
