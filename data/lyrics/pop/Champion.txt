<<<<<<< HEAD
Late nights on your pillow
Love as fast as light
Fading in to echoes
In my ventricles
I carry this cargo
Sinking deeper down
And though your love was shallow
I managed to drown

Is this how you're gonna make me look now?
Is this how you're gonna walk right out?
Then you'd better do it like a champion
And break my heart once and for all
Do you feel good knowing that you've won now?
Do you get high when I hit my lows?
Yeah I hope you feel like you're a champion
When you break my heart once and for all

I keep bending barrels
You take aim and shoot
I'm on pins and needles
Your skin's bulletproof
Don't try to be noble
Leaving me for dead
And though your love is hollow
I could use a hand
Is this how you're gonna make me look now?
Is this how you're gonna walk right out?
Then you'd better do it like a champion
And break my heart once and for all
Do you feel good knowing that you've won now?
Do you get high when I hit my lows?
Yeah I hope you feel like you're a champion
When you break my heart once and for all

Just break my heart once and for all
Do you feel good knowing that you've won now?
Do you get high when I hit my lows?
Yeah I hope you feel like you're a champion
When you break my heart once and for all
Yeah I hope you feel like you're a champion
