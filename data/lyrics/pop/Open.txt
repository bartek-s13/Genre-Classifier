I'm a fool for that shake in your thighs
I'm a fool for that sound in your sighs
I’m a fool for your belly
I'm a fool for you love

I want to make this play
Oh, I know you're faded
Hmm, but stay, don't close your hands
I want to make this play
Oh, I know you're faded
Hmm, but stay, don't close your hands

Caught in this pool held in your eyes
Caught like a fool without a line
We're in a natural spring
With this gentle sting between us

I want to make this play
Oh, I know you're faded
Hmm, but stay, don't close your hands
I wanna make this play
Oh, I know you're faded
Hmm, but stay, don't close your hands

Ooh, stay open
Ooh, stay open
Stay open
Stay open, baby

I want to make this play
Oh, I know you're faded
Hmm, but stay, don't close your hands
I want to make this play
Oh, I know you're faded
Hmm, but stay, don't close your hands

Stay open
Stay open
Stay open
