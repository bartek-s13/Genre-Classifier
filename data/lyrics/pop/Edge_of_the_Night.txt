Fifteen to five, another Friday afternoon
Watching the weekend creeping closer into view
Eye of the Tiger on the highway home to you
Home to you, home to you, home to you

Don't tell me you can't find time to party
I don't wanna hear that damn excuse
Baby if we can't go find a party
Guess we'll have to make one here for two

Milk and Honey, sunny delight
I wanna take you on a–
Street safari party alright
Into the wild jungle
Ooh-ooh if you ain't scared of the fall
We'll be hanging off the edge of the night, alright
Supernova galaxy kiss
I wanna take you on a–
Street safari party like this
Into the wild jungle
Ooh-ooh if you ain't scared of the fall
We'll be hanging off the edge of the night, alright

Fifteen to five, another sunrise next to you
I spent my pay check now there's nothing left to lose
Watching the ocean from a blanket on the roof
On the roof, on the roof, on the roof

Don't tell me you can't find time to party
I don't wanna hear that damn excuse
Baby if we can't go find a party
Guess we'll have to make one here for two

Milk and Honey, sunny delight
I wanna take you on a–
Street safari party alright
Into the wild jungle
Ooh-ooh if you ain't scared of the fall
We'll be hanging off the edge of the night, alright

Street safari party like this
Into the wild jungle
Ooh-ooh if you ain't scared of the fall
We'll be hanging off the edge of the night, alright

So wake up the neighbors
Sleep is overrated
Jump on it and shake it
Baby you're my favorite
Go wake up on the neighbors
Sleep is overrated
Jump on it and shake it
Baby you're my favorite
