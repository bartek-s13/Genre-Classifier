When you fell
From the sky
We all stopped and stood outside to wash our clothes
Baby we got soaked
When you fell
From the sky
I felt that burning in my eyes, drove me insane
I thought that you were holy water but you were just acid rain

There's a drought in California
The weeks turned into months my dear
And I wait up all night for you
The minutes turn into fucking years
And I see you through a skylight from a mile away, a mile away
I replay all the highlights from a different state, a different state

When you fell
From the sky
We all stopped and stood outside to wash our clothes
Baby we got soaked
When you fell
From the sky
I felt that burning in my eyes, drove me insane
I thought that you were holy water but you were just acid rain
I fill my cup from the tap
I let my sips overlap
I let the sink overflow
I drink it down 'til I'm bones
And I feel I can't be honest
About anything I wanted
Cause you're taunting with memories
Without even talking and I pray
For a drought again
Yeah I pray for damage undid
Oh and I’d give anything
To just take back the love I misplaced in you

When you fell
From the sky
We all stopped and stood outside to wash our clothes
Baby we got soaked
When you fell
From the sky
I felt that burning in my eyes, drove me insane
I thought that you were holy water but you were just acid rain

I thought that you were holy water but you were just acid rain
I thought that you were holy water but you were just acid rain
