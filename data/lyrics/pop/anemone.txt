Down below
My thoughts can wander and I let go
I don’t need much in my life, I know
I like it better underwater

I've been drowning in anemone
Here you’ll never get the best of me
I've been drowning in anemone
Breathing deep
Breathing deep

Down below
Sandy like the ocean floor, quiet like I like it
Here I'll never be alone
I pause my life, I spend my time
He's always right, it's never wrong to try
It’s been alright, I've been alright
But here it's better, I hear better
I like it better underwater, send me underwater

Feeling little pulls
Won't get the best of me so la-la-la let's go
A little destiny to tell you what you know
A fatal recipe of life

(Harmony)
Dreaming ‘bout a place where I can be by myself

Feeling little pulls
Won't get the best of me so la-la-la let's go
A little destiny to tell you what you know
