I heard broken footsteps
Was that you limping?
Well, I wish that I had spent just a little bit more time
With you, yeah
Tears on my ceiling
Weren't you watching?
Well I guess none of us will ever know what comes after
This
You're still lovely
You were lovely then
All that you had to endure
I guess nobody noticed it
I know your resemblance
Mm, it's out there walking
And I wanted you to know that I
Haven't forgotten
Ooh, and they tried to make you look broken
But not while I'm living
'Cause I wanted you to know that I heard what you said
While it was raining
You're still lovely
You were lovely then
All that you had to endure
I guess nobody noticed it
You made me
And I love you, and
Did you know nothing has changed?
And now everyone, they notice it
Everyone notices
You're still lovely
You were lovely then
All that you had to endure
I guess nobody noticed it
You made me
And I love you, and
Did you know nothing has changed?
And now everyone, they notice it
Everyone notices
