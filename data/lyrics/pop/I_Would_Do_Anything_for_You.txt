Never want to stand upon myself
Never want to get in the way... I said it
I don’t know what the plan is but you can share with me
‘Cause I’ll be a listening ear to everything you say
I won’t turn away and I'll listen
Open up my heart and I must say that I love you, so

Ooooh la love, I’ve fallen in love, and it’s better this time than ever before
Ooooh la love, I’ve fallen in love, and it’s better this time than I’ve ever known

Every day is a battle I face
Strange life I live, but its what you've decided
I’ll give it all into your hands
Do what you will with me, and I'll, I’ll smile when you speak
Remember all those times I was hoping for something
And shaking my head from all I have done
But you never left me

Ooooh la love, I’ve fallen in love, and it’s better this time than ever before
Ooooh la love, I’ve fallen in love, and it’s better this time than I’ve ever known
Ooooh la love, I’ve fallen in love, and it’s better this time than ever before
Ooooh la love, I’ve fallen in love, and it’s better this time than I’ve ever known

Give it up for you
I would give it up for you
I would give it up for you
I’d do anything for you

Ooooh la love, I’ve fallen in love, and it’s better this time than ever before
Ooooh la love, I’ve fallen in love, and it’s better this time than I’ve ever known
Ooooh la love, I’ve fallen in love, and it’s better this time than ever before
Ooooh la love, I’ve fallen in love, and it’s better this time than I’ve ever known

I have fallen in love
I have fallen in love
