I'm runnin' out of room
I'm runnin' out of money
I gave it all to you
But that don't make you love me

I hate giving you everything
Feels like I'm losing everything

So what am I to do
If you don't ever come through
I'm givin' up on you
But I don't really want to

I hate giving you everything
Feels like I'm losing everything

You made it real, made it real
When you left my life
Then messed it up the day you tried to make it right
I hate giving you everything
How does it feel, does it feel
When you make me cry
But I'm the one who still needs to apologize
I hate giving you everything

Could I live without you
Could I be without you
Cause I think about you all the time
Could I live without you
Could I be without you
Are you mine (x2)

I hate giving you everything
Feels like I'm losing everything

You made it real, made it real
When you left my life
Then messed it up the day you tried to make it right
I hate giving you everything
I'm runnin' out of room
I'm runnin' out of money
I gave it all to you
But that don't make you love me
