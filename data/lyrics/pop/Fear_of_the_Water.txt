Some ancient call, that I've answered before
It lives in my walls, and it's under the floor
If this was meant for me, why does it hurt so much?
And if you're not made for me, why did we fall in love?

Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no

A knock at my door, I thought I was alone
Unaware of what I thought I needed, I drop like a stone
If I'm not mistaken, then I was the last one to know
And if you return for me, I'd never want for more

Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
You're dislocated, don't be like that
And you smile when you dive in, like you're never coming back
So hold my body, yeah, hold my breath
See your face when I blackout, I'm never coming back

Fear of the water, fear of the water

(Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no)
You're dislocated, don't be like that
And you smile when you dive in, like you're never coming back
So hold my body, yeah, hold my breath
See your face when I blackout, I'm never coming back
(Fear of the water)
You're dislocated, don't be like that
And you smile when you dive in, like you're never coming back
(Fear of the water)
So hold my body, yeah, hold my breath
See your face when I blackout, I'm never coming back
