Hand me a drink, I need it now
I want a place with no time
Don't we feel it
Letting you in
I'm in the room we used to sleep
Know it's my fault we don't speak
Don't we feel it
Letting you in
It's like you still lay with me
Whisper all the things that make me go mad
Make me go mad
And I might be drunk but I just stay so tempted
Wondering what you're doing tonight
If we could do it, just one last time
Nobody does it like you do
Take me back, take me back, oh I
I need to forget ya
Would you do it, just one last time
Just for one night, no one has to know
I can’t get it off my mind
I promise to let go (promise to let go)
I know this night's so messed up
Thinking 'bout how we left us
But I can't help it, I can't help it
Imagine there's something to catch your fall
Did it all for nothing
I can't help it, yeah, I can't help it
It's like you still lay with me
Whisper all the things that make me go mad
Make me go mad
And i might be drunk but i just stay so tempted
Wondering what you're doing tonight
If we could do it, just one last time
Nobody does it like you do
Take me back, take me back, oh I
I need to forget ya
Would you do it, just one last time
Just for one night, no one has to know
I can’t get it off my mind
I promise to let go (promise to let go)
I need to forget ya (at all)
If we could do it just one last time…
Take me back, take me back, oh I…
If we could do it just one last time
Just for one night, no one has to know
I can't get it off my mind
I promise to let go
If we could do it just one last time
Nobody does it like you do
Take me back, take me back, oh I...
I need to forget ya
Would you do it just one last time
Just for one night, no one has to know
I can't get it off my mind
I promise to let go (promise to let you go)
Promise to let you go
Take me back, take me back, oh I…
If we could do it just one last time
