Sunday morning, I wake up
You're beside me, breathing so loud
The wall is empty and so flat
The world around me is too large, oh

And I know that I'm slow in the morning
As I fall into a hole without an end
Until, suddenly, I look at you
And all the mirrors vanish from my mind

Oh, oh, ah-ah, ah-ah, oh
Oh, ah-ah, ah-ah, oh
You're mine
Oh, oh, ah-ah, ah-ah, oh
Oh, ah-ah, ah-ah, oh
You're mine

Sunday morning, I wake up

The wall is empty and so flat
The world around me is too large, oh

And I know that I'm slow in the morning
As I fall into a hole without an end
Until, suddenly, I look at you
And all the mirrors vanish from my mind

Oh, oh, ah-ah, ah-ah, oh
Oh, ah-ah, ah-ah, oh
You're mine
Oh, oh, ah-ah, ah-ah, oh
Oh, ah-ah, ah-ah, oh
You're mine

And I know that I'm slow in the morning
Suddenly, I look at you
And all the mirrors vanish from my mind
And I know that I'm slow in the morning
Suddenly, I look at you
And all the mirrors vanish from my mind
