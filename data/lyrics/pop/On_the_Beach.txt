Between the eyes of love
I call your name
Behind those guarded walls
I used to go
I promise on the wind
There's a certain melody
Takes me back to the place that I know, oh

On the beach
(On the beach)
On the beach

The secrets of the summer
I will keep
The sands of time will blow
A mystery
No one but you and I
Underneath that moonlit sky
Takes me back to the place that I know, oh

On the beach
(On the beach)
On the beach
(On the beach)

Takes me back to the place that I know, oh

On the beach
(On the beach, oh, on the beach)
On the beach
(On the beach, oh, on the beach)
