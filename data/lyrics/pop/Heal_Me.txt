Same eyes, complexion
No love or affection
Same time, same place
But you don't recognise my face
I’m mad, you're crazy
Treat me like your baby
No change, no change at all

Yeah, I've been through some phases
And they’ve only tainted my view
We got similar faces, but I don't feel nothing like you

I'm not waiting for you to cure, you to heal me
I'm not waiting for, for your love, you can keep it
I'm not waiting for you to come back
For you to let me down like that
I'm not waiting for you to cure, I don't need it

Grew harder, found laughter
Found peace in all the cracks, oh
Disaster, I happened, I matter

No, no, you couldn't manage
You saw me as baggage, a dead weight
Now the tables are turning
Our bridges are burning, it’s too late
Though the tears are still coming out
I found the courage, there’s no hate

I'm not waiting for you to cure, you to heal me
I’m not waiting for, for your love, you can keep it
I'm not waiting for you to come back
For you to let me down like that
I'm not waiting for you to cure, I don't need it

Taking me back to the way we were
’Cause of you, I know what I deserve
Always the cause when I lost my nerve, no more
I'm not waiting for you to cure, you to heal me
I'm not waiting for, for your love, you can keep it

I'm not waiting for you to cure, you to heal me
I'm not waiting for, for your love, you can keep it
I'm not waiting for you to come back
For you to let me down like that
I'm not waiting for you to cure, I don't need it
