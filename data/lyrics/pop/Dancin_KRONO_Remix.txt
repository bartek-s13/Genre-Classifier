Get up on the floor
Dancin' all night long
Get up on the floor
Dancin' till the break of dawn
Get up on the floor
Dancin' till the break of dawn
Get up on the floor
Dancin'

All the time, my baby, you on my mind
And I don't know why, yeah but the feeling is fine
Can't you see, honey you are for me
Though it weren't meant to be
Dancin' in the moonlight
Gazing at the stars so bright
Holding you until the sunrise
Sleeping until the midnight

Get up on the floor
Dancin' all night long
Get up on the floor
Dancin' till the break of dawn
Get up on the floor
Dancin' till the break of dawn
Get up on the floor
Dancin'

Dancin' is what to do
Dancin's when I think of you
Dancin's what clears my soul
Dancin's what makes me whole
Dancin' is what to do
Dancin's when I think of you
Dancin's what clears my soul
Dancin's what makes me whole

Every time when I look in your eyes
I smile with pride, happy that you're mine.
Joy in love, your love is true I know
You are the best thing that has happened to me

Get up on the floor
Dancin' all night long
Get up on the floor
Dancin' till the break of dawn
Get up on the floor
Dancin' till the break of dawn
Get up on the floor
Dancin'

Dancin' is what to do
Dancin's when I think of you
Dancin's what clears my soul
Dancin's what makes me whole
Dancin' is what to do
Dancin's when I think of you
Dancin's what clears my soul
Dancin's what makes me whole

Get up on the floor
Dancin' all night long
Get up on the floor
Dancin' till the break of dawn
Get up on the floor
Dancin' till the break of dawn
Get up on the floor
Dancin'
Get up on the floor
Dancin' all night long
Get up on the floor
Dancin' till the break of dawn
Get up on the floor
Dancin' till the break of dawn
Get up on the floor
