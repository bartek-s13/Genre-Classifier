Well i got another letter in the mail today
After 27 lines i hadn't a thing to say
It said "i love you little brother but i don't know why
You let your hair get long and your soul grow tired
And so i took another walk into the grocery mall
And i took a couple of photos of the bathroom stalls
It seems that everyone is looking for the next good time
It made me feel a little funny so i closed my eyes
I started wishing for a chemical that make me feel
A little more animal, a little less real
I settled for the cigarette i got from the girl outside
She said i talked a little funny but i didn't mind

Oh, am i never gonna feel the same way?
Oh, am i ever gonna feel the same way?

Well i find it sorta silly how we push and pull
Scratching like a kitty til our paws are dull
It seems your brother likes boys but he ties his shoes
With the right side first, baby just like you
So i put a lot of make up on a cash machine
And i dressed up like a lady on a mezzanine
I started hollering a curse from the room upstairs
You see i thought that i was mighty but the truth is i'm scared

Oh, am i never gonna feel the same way?
Oh, am i ever gonna feel the same way?
