Mmm, oh

Too much of anything can make you sick
Even the good can be a curse (Curse)
Makes it hard to know which road to go down
Knowing too much can get you hurt
Is it better, is it worse?
Are we sitting in reverse?
It's just like we're going backwards (Backwards)
I know where I want this to go
Driving fast but let's go slow
What I don't wanna do is crash, no

Just know that you're not in this thing alone
There's always a place in me that you can call home
Whenever you feel like we're growin' apart
Let's just go back, back, back, back (Back, back)
Back to the start, oh

Anything that's worth having
Is sure enough, worth fighting for
Quitting's out of the question
When it gets tough, gotta fight some more (Oh)
We gotta fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight for this love
We gotta fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight for this love
We gotta fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight for this love
If it's worth having, it's worth fighting for
Oh oh oh

Now every day ain't gon' be no picnic
Love ain't a walk in the park
All you can do is make the best of it now
Can't be afraid of the dark

Just know that you're not in this thing alone
There's always a place in me that you can call home
Whenever you feel like we're growin' apart
Let's just go back, back, back, back (Back, back)
Back to the start, oh

Anything that's worth having
Is sure enough, worth fighting for
Quitting's out of the question
When it gets tough, gotta fight some more (Oh)
We gotta fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight for this love
We gotta fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight for this love (Oh, we gotta fight)
We gotta fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight for this love
If it's worth having, it's worth fighting for
Oh oh oh

I don't know where we're heading
I'm willing and ready to go
We've been driving so fast
We just need to slow down, and just roll
Oh oh oh

Anything that's worth having
Is sure enough, worth fighting for
Quitting's out of the question
When it gets tough, gotta fight some more (Oh)
We've gotta fight, fight, fight, fight (Fight, hey)
Fight for this love
We've gotta fight, fight, fight, fight (No matter how hard it gets)
Fight for this love
We've gotta fight, fight, fight, fight (We gotta fight, yeah)
Fight for this love
If it's worth having, it's worth fighting for (Oh oh oh)

We gotta fight, fight, fight, fight (We gotta fight, fight)
Fight for this love
We gotta fight, fight, fight, fight (We gotta fight, hey)
Fight for this love
We gotta fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight for this love
If it's worth having, it's worth fighting for
Oh oh oh
