Lying here
In my head, in my head, in my head
Done with the hiding, sick of the fighting
Dying here
There's nothing left, nothing left, nothing left
Stuck in the moment, where are we goin'?

It's been keeping me up all night
'Cause I know what it feels like
To be staring into headlights
Pretendin' that it's alright

I wanna know what's next
I'm gonna see what's left
I'm gonna see what's left after the landslide
We're in up to our necks
Don't care how hard it gets
I wanna know what's next after the landslide
After the landslide

All I know
When it's gone, when it's gone, when it's gone
We can erase it, but we can't escape it
'Cause we been driving through the dead of night
Hitting every red light
Now we're fighting just to stay alive
Finally, I realize

I wanna know what's next
I'm gonna see what's left
I'm gonna see what's left after the landslide
We're in up to our necks
Don't care how hard it gets
I wanna know what's next after the landslide
I wanna know what's next
I'm gonna see what's left
I'm gonna see what's left after the landslide
We're in up to our necks
Don't care how hard it gets
I wanna know what's next after the landslide
