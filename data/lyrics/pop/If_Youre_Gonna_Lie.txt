<<<<<<< HEAD
I poured you a glass of wine
And drank it for the second time
Then 7 PM turned to 10
I'm still alone and my lips are red
But not in a good way
And you're about to walk in that door
And say some shit you said before
You're getting so repetitive
I'm finishing your sentences
But not in a good way

I kinda like it when you hurt me
'Cause you come over saying sorry
So I put up with your lies just to have you for the night, baby
I kinda like it when you hurt me
I start believing all your stories
But I'd rather hear you lie than to hear you say goodbye to me

So if you're gonna lie, do it in my bed
If you're gonna lie, at least do it in my bed
So if you're gonna lie, do it in my bed
If you're gonna lie, make it worth it
You cut me down, you cut me deep
You say so many names in your sleep
Yeah, I can tell you've been having fun
I don't recognize a single one
Fuck you been doing? Mmm

I kinda like it when you hurt me

So if you're gonna lie, do it in my bed
If you're gonna lie, at least do it in my bed
So if you're gonna lie, do it in my bed
If you're gonna lie, make it worth it

You say you're out with friends, but you're with her tonight
I checked your location, good fuckin' try
I don't say a word, I don't wanna fight
By loving you, I'm losing me every night
So if you're gonna lie, do it in my bed
If you're gonna lie, at least do it in my bed
If you're gonna lie, at least do it in my bed
