Ooh, where's my coat?
The air's getting cold indoors
Pawn exotic decor
A rare form of skin tone and bone now, ow

The hands unfold
Just standing alone here to hold
The hands unfold
Demanding for warmth here to hold now, ow

And where do we go from here?
(Where do we go, go, go, go?)
All I own is gum, toe and sole
I care for none, my dear
(I care for none, my, my, my)
All I know is you look like my home
And where do we go from here?
(Where do we go, go, go, go?)
All I own is gum, toe and sole
I care for none, my dear
(I care for none, my, my, my)
