Crazy how I never saw this coming
Breaking up can be some shit
Sharing everything with one another
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'm just try'na find some peace and quiet
Put me in solitary confinement
'Cause anywhere I go, I know I'll find ya
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah

'Cause when we got the same friends
Making it complicated
Always in the same places
Makes it hard to never see you again, see you again
With the same friends
Makes it so damn frustrating
Always bringing up your name and
Makes it hard to never see you again, see you again baby

Always following me round just like a shadow
Even when the sun goes down
Man I should've listened to my mother
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
When we got the same friends
Making it complicated
Always in the same places
Makes it hard to never see you again, see you again
With the same friends
Makes it so damn frustrating
Always bringing up your name and
Makes it hard to never see you again, see you again baby

Sarah's try'na kick it but your name is on the ticket
Tammy's on the fence and we been friends since single digits
Mark, Maria, Aaron, they just really wanna love me, oh oh oh
Alex, T.E., Spencer really wanna smoke
They used to call me up before you ran away with Joe
Rich is staying quiet, he pretend like he don't know, oh oh oh

We got the same friends
We got the same friends, yeah
We got the same friends
They'll never leave me alone, na na
