I heard you coming at a quarter to three
You closed the door and laid down next to me
But then I heard you say her name in your sleep
Your dirty secret's too far gone to keep

I, I, I
I'm 'bout to lose my
I, I am, I
I'm 'bout to lose my
My mind, my mind, my mind
'Bout to lose my
My mind, my mind
I think about you all the time, oh, hey

You can't even look me dead in the eyes
Her love is strong, she got you hypnotised
You say you love me, but I know it's a lie
When I work so hard to keep you satisfied

I, I, I
I'm 'bout to lose my
I, oh, I am, I
I'm 'bout to lose my
My mind, my mind, my mind
'Bout to lose my
My mind, my mind, my mind
'Bout to lose my, woah
How could ya? How could you do, do this to me?
No way, no way, she can't take you away from me
I sure won't stay, but I'll be damned if I ever leave
No way, no way, she won't take you away from me
I sure won't stay, but I'll be damned if I ever leave
If I ever leave
Anybody know what I'm talking about?
No way, no way, she can't take you away from me, yeah
No way, no way
And I sure won't stay, but I'll be damned if I ever leave

In my mind, my mind, my mind
I think about you all the, all the time
My mind, my mind, my mind
You will always be mine
