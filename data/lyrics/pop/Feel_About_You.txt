Thought I needed some medicine
But this is how I always been
'Cause we always go too far
Never know when if we will end
Which way do you recommend?
They can know me by heart, my friend
Don't we always go too far?
Never knowing where we will end

It's what I feel about you
It's what I feel about you
It's what I feel about you
It's what I feel about you, babe
It's what I feel about you, babe

Which way do you recommend?
They can know me by heart, my friend
Don't we always go too far?
Never knowing where we will end

It's what I feel about you
It's what I feel about you
It's what I feel about you
It's what I feel about you, babe
It's what I feel about you, babe
It's what I feel about you
It's what I feel about you
It's what I feel about you
It's what I feel about you, babe

It's what I feel about you
It's what I feel about you, babe
It's what I feel about you
