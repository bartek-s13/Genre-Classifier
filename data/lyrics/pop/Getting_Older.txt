<<<<<<< HEAD
Saw a bird in the parking lot
Sittin' there chillin' cause he couldn't fly
And the lady wanna drive by
But I'm just tryna save a life
I reached down but he hopped away
Further and further he went into harms way
And now I'm starting to relate to
Just what the fuck he's going through

Oh, oh-oh
Oh I've been down before, yeah I've lost it all
Oh, oh-oh
Oh now I'm up, and it's something kind of terrifying

Cause I can't imagine getting older
Does that mean I'm gonna die young?
Does that mean I'm gonna die young?
I can't imagine getting older
Does that mean I'm gonna die young?
Does that mean I'm gonna die young?
I'm not worried about the aging process
There's nothing wrong with that discount breakfast
But all my friends are playing house
And I'm sleeping in that guest house
So if the world has a plan for me
Could I just take a fucking peek?
I'm scared of the unknown
Where do I go when it's time to go?

I can't imagine getting older
Does that mean I'm gonna die young?
Does that mean I'm gonna die young?
I can't imagine getting older
Does that mean I'm gonna die young?
Does that mean I'm gonna die young?

Oh, oh-oh
Oh I've been down before, yeah I've lost it all
Oh, oh-oh
Oh now I'm up, and it's something kind of terrifying
Cause I can't imagine getting older
Does that mean I'm gonna die young?
Does that mean I'm gonna die young?
I can't imagine getting older
Does that mean I'm gonna die young?
Does that mean I'm gonna die young?
