Jaja, everybody knows I'm live (Candela)
Everybody knows I'm five (Candela)
Go ahead and slip, I'll slide
All up in your B-O-D-Y

Babe, don't make a sound
2 a.m. love gotta keep it down (Keep it down)
Don't wait around for a signal now
Gimme some verbs, I ain't talkin' nouns (I'm naughty)
You wanna ride in the Six
You wanna dine in the Six (Dine in the Six)
But when I lean for the kiss
You said I'll probably send you some pics
And I'm like

Hell nah, been waitin' too long (I've been waitin')
(brando)
Hell nah, I want that crew love (Come here, baby)
(Nicky-Nicky Jam)
Hell nah, been waitin' too long (I've been waitin')
(Loud Luxury)
Hell nah, I want that crew love
(Mr. Worldwide)
Body on my, losin' all my innocence, yeah
Body on my, grindin' on my innocence, yeah
Body on my, losin' all my innocence, yeah
Body on my, grindin' on my innocence, yeah

She got the body of a goddess
Booty so big, you can see it from the front
I wanna ride it
Baby, you exotic
Mami gotta be a chiropractor
The way she break necks with that body
La-di-da-di, we came to party
305, look what we started
We gon' slide (Go 'head, shawty)
We gon' ride, go 'head, shawty
Now gimme that

Crew love, that cool love
Get naked, mama
Tu papi chulo, bien duro
Te lo quiere dar
I want that crew love, that cool love
Get naked, mama

Body on my, losin' all my innocence, yeah

I need you, baby
You got me waiting too long (Got me waiting too long)
Yo quiero darte bien duro esa canción
I like you how look in my bed (Eh)
Y cómo lo hace', bebé (Eh)
They way that you're moving your body
I know that you're naughty, the way that you flex

I want that crew love, that cool love
Get naked, mama
Tu papi chulo, bien duro
Te lo quiere dar
