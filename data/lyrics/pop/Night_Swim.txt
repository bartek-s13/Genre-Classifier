Swim, swim, swim
Swim, swim, swim, swim...

Take off your clothes
The water is warm
I wanna take you for a night swim
Believe what you want
There's no one around
Don't play games, just get in
Oh, I spent all my money on this view
So I could be alone, lost with you

Dig your nails into my back
Not here, can't know what this means
You're used to getting everything you want
But you're the only thing that's come my way for free
Whisper words into my ears, will you?
As we dissolve into the breeze
You're taking me back to the start
With you I forget who I've been, I'm clean

I know that it's late but wait
Wait, I'll guide you home
Just stay a little longer and swim
With me in this roof-top pool
I know that it's late but wait
Wait, I'll guide you home
Just stay a little longer and swim
With me in this roof-top pool

Happiness saves
It's bite till the end
It never lost forever
And sometimes I think
I'd be better off
Out of the city all together
Still I spend all my money on these view
Cause none of that shit matters up here with you

Dig your nails into my back
Not here, can't know what this means
You're used to getting everything you want
But you're the only thing that's come my way for free
Whisper words into my ears, will you?
As we dissolve into the breeze
You're taking me back to the start
With you I forget who I've been, I'm clean

I know that it's late but wait
Wait, I'll guide you home
Just stay a little longer and swim
With me in this roof-top pool
I know that it's late but wait
Wait, I'll guide you home
Just stay a little longer and swim
