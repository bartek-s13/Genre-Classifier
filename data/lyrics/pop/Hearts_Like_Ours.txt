Borders and horizon lines
We're alone but side by side
We're yet to dream, we're yet to dream
Nothing here is what it seems

There's an animal inside
There's a fear that won't subside
Of all the things I'll never do
Will I ever follow through?

There's an animal inside
There's an animal inside

Half awake and almost dead
Keeping empty beds elsewhere
We're yet to bleed, we're yet to bleed
All the time and energy

Silence
In silence
Could we try to reinvent?
Feed the head with common sense?
Through the streets and avenues
Climbing up the walls with you

Climbing up the walls with you
Climbing up the walls with you

Half awake and almost dead
Keeping empty beds elsewhere
We're yet to bleed, we're yet to bleed
All the time and energy

Silence
In silence

Leave this place behind, in silence
And the weight we find inside us

Lead me to the edge of night
'Til the dawn, the end of time
'Til the fire blazing light
Shines again within our eyes
Half awake and almost dead
Keeping empty beds elsewhere
We're yet to bleed, we're yet to bleed
All the time and energy
Half awake and almost dead
Keeping empty beds elsewhere
We're yet to bleed, we're yet to bleed
All the time and energy
