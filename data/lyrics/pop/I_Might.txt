<<<<<<< HEAD
Oh I love, oh I love, love my freedom
More than happy to be at a table for one
Go to a movie with just yours truly
Stay out all night or go to sleep early

I do what I want to do
Got no one to answer to
Live whatever life I choose
I'm free

Don't want no one taking up my time
Staying on my mind, changing up my life
Don't want no one messing up my bed
Fucking with my head, it's no lie
But when you look at me like that
I might

Oh I like, oh I like singing loudly
In my room out of tune with no one around me
Being stupid, acting crazy
Work hard all day, I spend the day being lazy

I go where I want to go
Living fast or taking it slow
Like it out here on my own
I'm free

Don't want no one taking up my time
Staying on my mind, changing up my life
Don't want no one messing up my bed
Fucking with my head, it’s no lie
But when you look at me like that
I might

Might never walk away
Might beg you to stay
Might change everything just to keep you close to me

Don't want no one taking up my time
Staying on my mind, changing up my life
Don't want no one messing up my bed
Fucking with my head, it’s no lie
But when you look at me like that
I might, I might, I might
When you look at me like that
