Think about what you've got and compare it to what I've got
Now what do you think my girl wants, my girl wants?
Think about what I've got and compare it to what you've got
What do you think my girl wants, my girl wants?
What do you think my girl wants?
Don't call her lazy cause she's crazy about the daytime TV
Channel 3, look at me, I'm a real whale watcher
They think I'm smart
They think it's art but then I start with a crash
I'm just a brash trash-talker
I like some funky drums, but I hate some chunky drummers
And I saw what your girl did last summer
She said it looks like a binge
She said it felt like a blast
Woke up in the grass with the assless chaps
Looks like a blast
She said it felt like a binge
Woke up with your friend in the Indian fringes
Bring on the bed-spins, bring on the Mini-Thins
Bring on the bed-spins, bring on the Mini-Thins
And she was bombed on the bass and the Bombay gin
She stumbled in
That's when she said, she says "it's great getting high"
I want everybody who's been eyeing my girl to slowly close their eyes
Said "it's great getting high"
I want everybody who's been eyeing my girl to slowly close their eyes
And think about what you've got, compare it to what I've got, and ask yourself:
