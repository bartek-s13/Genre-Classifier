It’s the sick to your stomach feeling with a smile on your face
It’s the memory you ignore, but you can’t erase
It’s the text in the middle of the night you didn’t ask for
It can help your career, but at what cost?
Are you holding back something that you’re dying to say?

Me, too
Girl, I believe you
Are you losing your mind thinking what will it take
To make somebody listen to you?
Me, too

It’s the room full of rumors and everybody starin’
Did they tell you you were asking for it by what you were wearin’?
It’s the stains from your makeup and tears on your pillow
It’s a piece of yourself that you let go
Do you wanna scream but just can’t find the air?

Me, too
Girl, I believe you
Are you losing your mind thinking what will it take
To make somebody listen to you?
Me, too

They say step up and sit down
Shut up and back down
So what’s up, yeah, what’s up with that?
So we dress up, get felt up
Get shot down, don’t speak up
Yeah, what's up, yeah, what's up with that?
Are you holding back something
That you’ve just been dying to say?

Me, too
Girl, I believe you
Do you know every battle that you've had to face
Is making you bulletproof?
Me, too
Me, too
Girl, I believe you
Do you know every battle that you've had to face
Is making you bulletproof?
Me, too
