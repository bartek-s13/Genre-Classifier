Hey!
Who messed your heart up?
I bet you didn't even know that I
I've been here so long
But you can have my hand to hold

I'll be your love
Turn your broken heart into gold
So what you waiting for?
You got that touch
You could start a fire in my soul
So tell me what you waiting for?
Waiting for
Waiting for
Waiting for
Waiting for
Waiting for
Waiting for
So tell me what you waiting for

Hey
I told ya, and told ya
At times I had to bite my tongue
But
Summer ain't over
We've still got time to chase the sun
I'll be your love
Turn your broken heart into gold
So what you waiting for?
You got that touch
You could start a fire in my soul
So tell me what you waiting for?
Waiting for
Waiting for
Waiting for
Waiting for
Waiting for
Waiting for
So tell me what you waiting for

I'll be your love
Turn your broken heart into gold
So what you waiting for?
You got that touch
You could start a fire in my soul
So tell me what you waiting for?

So tell me
So tell me
So tell me what you waiting for?
