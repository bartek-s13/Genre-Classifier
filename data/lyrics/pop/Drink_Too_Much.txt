I got a crush on Steph Claire Smith, oh
But she'd never like no fool like me
But I'm more than my crooked teeth
No one wants to ride my wave
Am I really that insane?
Mama said don't misbehave, yeah
And if I wanna make it work, I better go and dish my dirt, so

I'm sorry if you ever have to carry me home
I'm sorry if I ever make you feel so alone
I'm sorry if I never ever pick up my phone
When you really need me, you really need me
I'm sorry if you ever have to carry me home
I'm sorry if I ever make you feel so alone
I'm sorry if I never ever pick up my phone
When you really need me

I just wanna get into trouble
I wanna be out to lunch
My last girl, she dumped me
'Cause I would drink too much
I just wanna get into trouble
I wanna be out to lunch
My last girl she dumped me
'Cause I would drink, I would drink, I would drink too much
I'm feeling low, you'd never know
Getting in trouble
'Cause I would drink, I would drink, I would drink too much
I'm chasing highs in strangers' eyes
Getting in trouble
'Cause I would drink, I would drink, I would drink too much

Doesn't have to be this way
Would you ride with me? Fly with me? No, no
'Cause no one wants to stay with me
No one wants to play with me, so I'll go
Two shots, through the door
Say it again, if I wanna make it work
Better go and dish my dirt

I just wanna get into trouble
I wanna be out to lunch
My last girl, she dumped me
'Cause I would drink too much
I just wanna get into trouble
I wanna be out to lunch
My last girl she dumped me
'Cause I would drink, I would drink, I would drink too much
I'm feeling low (I'm feeling low), you'd never know
Getting in trouble
'Cause I would drink, I would drink, I would drink too much
I'm chasing highs (I'm chasing highs), in strangers' eyes
Getting in trouble
'Cause I would drink, I would drink, I would drink too much

'Cause I would, I would, I would drink too much
'Cause I would, I would, I would drink too much
(I just wanna get into trouble)
'Cause I would, I would, I would drink too much
('Cause I would drink, I would drink, I just wanna get into trouble)
'Cause I would, I would, I would drink too much
('Cause I would drink, I would drink, I would drink too much)

I'm sorry if you ever have to carry me home
I'm sorry if I ever make you feel so alone
I'm sorry if I never ever pick up my phone
When you really need me, you really need me
I'm sorry if you ever have to carry me home
I'm sorry if I ever make you feel so alone
I'm sorry if I never ever pick up my phone
When you really need me
