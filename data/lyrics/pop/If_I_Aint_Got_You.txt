You're still in my place

We're so high, I just wanna stay right here wit' you
What you wanna do?
Baby, let me love you, love you

Baby, going crazy
I don't know what I'll do if I ain't got you
Babe, you been right beside me
And I don't got a clue if I ain't got you, babe

What happened to everything that we started?
Don't let go 'cause I know
Babe, me and you gon' be left broken hearted
