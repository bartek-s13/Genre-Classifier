Yeah, you
You look familiar, skin like vanilla
You're onto me, I'm onto you
I gotta make it work
And my blood like tequila, and it's making me weaker
I look, you look
Our bodies talk, no need to say a word

No dancing like nobody else, nobody's watching
And if you let me
I won't take it, I won't take it

Slow-oh-oh, all the way-ay-ay
We can go-oh-oh
You are fire, you are fire, wanna burn?
Burn, burn, burn it up-up-up
Let you know-oh-oh
You are fire, you are fire
I wanna burn

(You are fire, you are fire, you are fire)
(Wanna burn?)
(You are fire, you are fire, you are fire)
(I wanna burn)
(You are fire, you are fire, you are fire)
(Wanna burn?)
(You are a fire, you are fire)
You are fire
I wanna burn
Now we got familiar
We melt like we're chocolate
I taste your love, you're like a drug
Yeah, Imma give you all
All my attention, to all your dimensions
Let's do the things we're made to do
And let our bodies talk

Let's do it like nobody else, nobody's watching
And if you let me
I won't take it, I won't take it

Slow-oh-oh, all the way-ay-ay
We can go-oh-oh
You are fire, you are fire, wanna burn?
Burn, burn, burn it up-up-up
Let you know-oh-oh
You are fire, you are fire
I wanna burn

(You are fire, you are fire, you are fire)
(Wanna burn?)
(You are fire, you are fire, you are fire)
(I wanna burn)
(You are fire, you are fire, you are fire)
(Wanna burn?)
(You are fire, you are fire)
I won't take it, I won't take it
Slow-oh-oh-oh, all the way-ay-ay-ay
Yeah, we can go-oh-oh-oh
Well, you are fire, you are fire, wanna burn?
Burn, burn, burn it up-up-up
Let you know-oh-oh
You are fire, you are fire
I wanna burn

(You are fire, you are fire, you are fire)
(Wanna burn?)
(You are fire, you are fire, you are fire)
(Wanna burn?)
(You are fire, you are fire, you are fire)
(Wanna burn?)
(You are fire, you are fire, you are fire)
