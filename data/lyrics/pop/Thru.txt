(Ooh ooh ooh oh, ooh ooh ooh oh)

I think I'm going crazy
You said to leave later
Don't know about you
But I can feel it in this room
Let's fall a little deeper
I know you're not a keeper
Don't know about you
But I can feel it thru and thru
(Ooh ooh ooh oh, ooh ooh ooh oh)

Don't know about you
But I can feel it thru and thru
(Ooh ooh ooh oh, ooh ooh ooh oh)
Don't know about you
But I can feel it thru and thru
(Ooh ooh ooh oh, ooh ooh ooh oh)

It's four in the morning
You've caught me in a moment
Don't know about you
But I can feel it in this room
(Ooh ooh ooh oh, ooh ooh ooh oh)
And all of our reason
Lost to deceiving
Ooh ooh ooh I tried
To make it thru
(Ooh ooh ooh oh, ooh ooh ooh oh)

Don't know about you
But I can feel it thru and thru
(Ooh ooh ooh oh, ooh ooh ooh oh)
Don't know about you
But I can feel it thru and thru

Don't know about you
Don't know about you
Don't know about you
But I can feel it thru and thru
Don't know about you
Don't know about you
Don't know about you
But I can feel it thru and thru

Sky's reaching out I want it (Reaching out I want it)
To take us back home again (Ooh ooh ooh oh)
And all of your holding on (All of your holding on)
It's getting lost in my head (Ooh ooh ooh oh)
And oh your love is
All I wanted
To save

Don't know about you
Don't know about you
Don't know about you
But I can feel it thru and thru
(Ooh ooh ooh oh)
