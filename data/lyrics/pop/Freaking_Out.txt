Yeah yeah
I'm so tired right now
Yeah

I'm so God damn tired, I need the sleep
And I know that we've been up all night trying not to speak
Been playing 'round 'bout a month or two
We're making the sounds, don't sound like the truth
But I'm so God damn tired, I need the sleep

I been freaking out (Yuh)
You been having doubts (Yuh)
Tell me what you want, anything at all
I just need to know now
Are you freaking out?

I get insecure, that makes me sick, yeah
I'm trying to find the cure for all this shit, oh woah
So I try, but you won't commit
To having a fight, so we fuck through it
Then I hate that I get insecure, that makes me sick, yeah

I been freaking out (Yuh)
You been having doubts (Yuh)
Tell me what you want, anything at all
I just need to know now
Are you freaking out?

Swear that when I met you, you got up inside my head
(Up inside my head)
You said you'd never leave while we were laying in your bed
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine if it's never the same
(It's never the same)
It's just another story in my brain
(Oh, I'm freaking out)

I been freaking out (Yuh)
You been having doubts (Oh, yuh)
Tell me what you want, anything at all (What you want, anything)
I just need to know now
Are you freaking out? (Yuh)
You been having doubts (Yuh)
Tell me what you want, anything at all
I just need to know now
Are you freaking out?
