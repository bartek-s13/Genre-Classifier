Just hear me out
If it's not perfect I'll perfect it 'til my heart explodes
I highly doubt
That I can make it through another of your episodes
Lashing out
One of the petty moves you pull before you lose control
You wear me out
But it's all right now

Let's go home and get stoned
We could end up makin' love instead of misery
Go home and get stoned
Cause the sex is so much better when you're mad at me
You wear me out
(We could end up makin' love instead of misery)
But it's all right now

Without a doubt
All the breakup's worth the make up sex you're givin' me
Let's hash it out
Cause your bitchin' and your yellin' don't mean anything
Don't count me out
I can handle all the baggage that you're carrying
You wear me out
But it's all right now
Let's go home and get stoned
We could end up makin' love instead of misery
Go home and get stoned
Cause the sex is so much better when you're mad at me
You wear me out
(We could end up makin' love instead of misery)
But it's all right now

Let's go home and get stoned
We could end up makin' love instead of misery
Go home and get stoned
Cause the sex is so much better when you're mad at me

Go home and get stoned
We could end up makin' love instead of misery
Go home and get stoned
Cause the sex is so much better when you're mad at me
You wear me out
(We could end up makin' love instead of misery)
But it's all right now
Cause the sex is so much better when you're mad at me
Let's go home and get stoned
Let's go home and get stoned
