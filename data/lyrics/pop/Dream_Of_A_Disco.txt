I got you moving
I see you flashing
I got you grooving
I make you dancing
I dream of a disco
We’re dancing and dancing
The strobe lights make us
Romancing, romancing
With you in the disco
I’m happy, I’m happy
Please freeze it and keep it
Forever, forever
Can you feel love?
Can you feel joy?
Can you feel me?
