I had heard of love but had my doubts
Heartache was something I could do without
But it started changing when you came around
And now I never want it to fade

Now that we've lit this fire
(Get na-na-na-na-na)
We've got to fan the flame
(Get na-na-na-na-na)
To keep it burning higher
(Get na-na-na-na-na)
To die another day
To die another day

(Hoo, ha)
We belong together
(Hoo, ha)
The diamond's under pressure, baby
(Hoo, ha)
Through whatever weather
(Hoo, ha)
We belong together, baby
We can chase the summer 'til the sun burns out
Not even gravity can hold us down
Yes I'm holding on to every minute now
No I don't ever want it to fade

Now that we've lit this fire
(Get na-na-na-na-na)
We've got to fan the flame
(Get na-na-na-na-na)
To keep it burning higher
(Get na-na-na-na-na)
To die another day
To die another day

(Hoo, ha)
We belong together
(Hoo, ha)
The diamond's under pressure, baby
(Hoo, ha)
Through whatever weather
(Hoo, ha)
We belong together, baby
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
There's something I love about
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
There's something I love about
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
The woman that's all you are
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
There's something I love

We belong together
The diamond's under pressure, baby
Through whatever weather
We belong together, baby (Oh yeah)
(Hoo, ha)
We belong together
(Hoo, ha)
The diamond's under pressure, baby
(Hoo, ha)
Through whatever weather
(Hoo, ha)
We belong together, baby

Oh, oh, get na-na-na-na-na
Oh, oh, get na-na-na-na-na
(We belong together)
Oh, oh, get na-na-na-na-na
Oh, oh, get na-na-na-na-na
(We belong together, baby)
Oh, oh, get na-na-na-na-na
Oh, oh
(We belong together, baby)
