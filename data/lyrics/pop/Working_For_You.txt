This drink
Isn't my trigger
It's you and me in that Polaroid picture
I keep on my dash
I see everyday
Tried dozen of times to throw it away
And this smoke
Won't be my killer
It's hope that I might finally get rid of this ghost
That follows me around
And little reminders all over this town

And I know
I shouldn't be calling this late
But I lost control and I hate
The way I can't stop it once it begins
I'm sorry I couldn't resist
I swear this will be the last time
And I hear you're doing just fine
But I've done everything I can do
Please tell me what's working for you

Words
They don't mean nothing
If I don't pick myself up
I can't count all the nights
I broke down to my friends
Begging for help just to fall back again

And I know
I shouldn't be calling this late
But I lost control and I hate
The way I can't stop it once it begins
I'm sorry I couldn't resist
I swear this will be the last time
And I hear you're doing just fine
But I've done everything I can do
Please tell me what's working for you
Tell me what's working for you

Did you reach out for help
Or do it all by yourself
Did you forget me by falling for somebody else
I just need to know
And I promise I'll leave you alone

And I know
I shouldn't be calling this late
But I lost control and I hate
The way I can't stop it once it begins
I'm sorry I couldn't resist
I swear this will be the last time
And I hear you're doing just fine
But I've done everything I can do
Please tell me what's working for you
Oh
Tell me what's working for you
Tell me what's working for you
Oh, Oh, Oh
Tell me what's working for you
