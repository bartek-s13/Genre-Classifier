When love was found
I kept my hope just like I'd hoped to
Then sang to the sea for feelings deep blue
And coming down
And we've had problems that we've grown through
But I bet you dream of what you could do
At seventeen, I was alright
Was like nothing I could feel inside
And wishing you were here tonight is like holding on
But I still get to see your face, right?
And that's like nothing they can take, right?
So there won't be no feeling in the firelight
Hoping this'll be right
Time to show your worth, child
I remember when her heart broke over stubborn shit
That's no way to be living kid
The angel of death is ruthless
And I'm always thinking summertime with the bikes out
Pushing our luck, getting wiped out
Days with nothing but laughing loud
Underneath my coat, won't you tap my shoulder, hold my hand
Nights with nothing but dark in there
You could be my armor then
Island smiles and cardigans
The nights that we've been drinking in
We're here to help you kill all of this hurt that you've been harboring
Confessions should be better planned
Alone, that night, I'm surely damned
Run away,. I'll understand
What's important is this evening I will not forget
Purple, blue, orange, red
These colors of feeling, give me love, I'll put my heart in it
And I think about it all the time
Lights went out, you were fine
You kinda struggle not to shine
I still love you, though
I still love you, though
I still love you always
So hold me when I'm home, keep the evenings long
Crack and break and part ways
I still love you, though
I still love you, though
I still love you always
So hold me when I'm home, keep the evenings long
Let's not crack and break and part ways
And I wonder if I could let her down
It's for real, it's for real
