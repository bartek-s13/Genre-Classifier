I can do what I want
I'm in complete control
That's what I tell myself
I got a mind of my own
I'll be alright alone
Don't need anybody else
I gave myself a good talking-to
No more being a fool for you
With that look I know so well
I fall completely under your spell
Damn your eyes
For taking my breath away
For making me wanna stay
Damn your eyes
For getting my hopes up high
For making me fall in love again
Damn your eyes
It's always the same
You said that you'll change
Somehow you never do
But I believe all your lies
The look in your eyes
You make it all seem true
I guess I just see what I wanna see
Or is my heart just deceiving me?
I remember just how you
Made me wanna surrender

Damn your eyes
For getting my hopes up high
For making me fall in love again
Damn your eyes
For taking my breath away
For making me wanna stay
Damn your eyes
I fell completely under your spell
So damn your eyes
For taking my breath away
For making me wanna stay
Damn your eyes
