I've been spending all my time, spending all my tie
Get you out of my brain, get you out of my mind
’Cause as soon as you're in my head
I find you straight back in my bed
Why am I doing it to myself, doing it to myself?
When I already know that you're bad for my health
And giving in only makes it worse
It’s like I'm trying to get hurt

And I know, I know it didn't work
Though I tried everything to put you first
I never quite got that in return, no

We just want different things
We want different things
I only wanted to love you
But you made it fucking hard to
We want different things
We want different things
We're never on the same page
Guess you never felt the same way

I've been trying to move on, really trying to move on
But I find it so hard, guess I ain't that headstrong
And does it even affect you?
Do you still think about me too?

Oh, I know, I know it didn't work
Though I tried everything to put you first
I never quite got that in return

We just want different things
We want different things
I only wanted to love you
But you made it fucking hard to
We want different things
We want different things
We're never on the same page
Guess you never felt the same way

I keep remembering your hands on my skin
The way you would feel when you would pull me in
But then you stopped doing it
And it tore me apart, that shit broke my heart
To me it was love, to you it was all too much
So I guess we just

We just want different things
We want different things (Oh no, no, no, no, no)
I only wanted to love you
But you made it fucking hard to
We want different things
We want different things
We’re never on the same page
Guess you never felt the same way
(Never felt the same way, oh)

Come back
