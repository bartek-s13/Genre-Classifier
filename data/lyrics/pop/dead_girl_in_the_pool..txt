One, two, three, four

Empty bottles everywhere
People sleeping on the stairs
Got something stuck in my hair
No idea how it got there

This is the morning after
The house is such a disaster
But there's someone outside
That caught my eye

There's a dead girl in the pool
There's a dead girl in the pool
There's a dead girl in the pool
I don't know what to do
I'm the dead girl in the pool
I'm the dead girl in the pool
I'm the dead girl in the pool

I can't stop staring at my face
My summer tan has begun to fade
Is this real or is this fake?
A creepy dream I can't escape
This is the morning after
My mind is such a disaster
But there's someone outside
That caught my eye

There's a dead girl in the pool
There's a dead girl in the pool
There's a dead girl in the pool
I don't know what to do
I'm the dead girl in the pool
I'm the dead girl in the pool
I'm the dead girl in the pool

I'm the dead girl in the pool
What the fuck is going on?
I'm the dead girl in the pool, whoa

This is the morning after
My mind is such a disaster
But there's someone outside
That caught my eye
There's a dead girl in the pool
There's a dead girl in the pool
There's a dead girl in the pool
I'm the dead girl in the pool
I'm the dead girl in the pool
I'm the dead girl in the pool
