Oh, hoo-ooh, hoo-ooh, hoo-ooh
Hoo-ooh, hoo-ooh, hoo-ooh

I don’t really know you, I can’t
Find a reason why my heart is out of my chest
The morning that I saw two, angry people
I knew that I couldn’t forget
Everything I went through
Led me to say that I still wouldn’t settle for less, mm

I miss my conversations
With the moon
But we’d always end up talking about you
Those table reservations
So tired of sitting alone in the corner on end
My silly expectations
For thinking that you would go further than what we call next

I wish you would just notice all the glances you would take
Through the hoard of tasteless people
All those brooms swept them away
All my force stuck on the table and these orange metal plates
'Til my mind finds the courage, there's none that I can do

Hoo-ooh, hoo-ooh, hoo-ooh
Hoo-ooh, hoo-ooh, hoo-ooh

We aren’t even dating and we never will be
But somehow you ruin my life anyway and that scares me
It scares me up to the point that I’m thinkin' how
Someone lives in my basement
Over me and my body
By being themselves

I wish you would just notice all the glances you would take
Through the hoard of tasteless people
All those brooms swept them away
All my force stuck on this table and these orange metal plates
'Til my mind finds the courage, there's none that I can

Take all that you want from me cause I have nothing left
To give you with security I swear I couldn’t let
The thought of you escape the realm that I have solely sworn...
Till my mind finds the courage there's none that I can do

Hoo-ooh, hoo-ooh, hoo-ooh
I can do
Hoo-ooh, hoo-ooh, hoo-ooh
