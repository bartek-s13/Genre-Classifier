Long nights and cold beds
Breaking down, hurting heads
Lost touch of the energy
Losing all the chemistry

Moving on, moving on
Keeping strong, keeping strong
New flame in the darkness
I'll move on, I promise
I'll move on, I promise

Better off on a separate path
Change ahead, learn from the past
Need someone I can lean on
Start again and build strong

Moving on, moving on
Keeping strong, keeping strong
New flame in the darkness
I'll move on, I promise
Moving on, oh yeah
I'll move on, I promise
Making new wishes
Making new wishes, new wish
Making new wishes
Moving on, moving on
Keeping strong, strong
Making
New flame in the darkness

Moving on, moving on (-ishes)
Keeping strong, keeping strong
(Making) New flame in the darkness
