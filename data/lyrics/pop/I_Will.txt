You look prettier in the picture
Or at least that's what you said before we met today
But I think you lied, 'cause I like your face

Yeah, you're prettier than a picture
Or at least that's what I thought, I thought I'd have to say
But I couldn't speak a thing
'Cause you took my breath away

So baby, before you go
Can you tell me everything I should know?
Are you coming over tonight
Or do I have to wait for the rest of my life?

'Cause you know I will, I will, I will
You know I will, I will, I will
I will if you will (oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
I will if you will (oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
If we go to a party in the hills
The music is good, my cup is filled
I'd better go home with you and you
Yeah, I will if you will
(I will if you will)
There's not much to do in the valley
But as long as I'm with you, no, it won't matter much
We can pour our drinks in cracks along the sidewalk

So baby, before you go
Can you tell me everything I should know?
Are you coming over tonight
Or do I have to wait for the rest of my life?

'Cause you know I will, I will, I will
You know I will, I will, I will
I will if you will (oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
I will if you will (oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
If we go to a party in the hills
The music is good, my cup is filled
I'd better go home with you and you
I will if you will, I will if you will
I will if you will, I will if you will
