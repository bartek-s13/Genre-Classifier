My world
Was going under
I needed love
But got a doctor
I'm out of control
I'm out of control

He gave me pills
To forget I missed ya
You take some more
And you'll be better
And I'm out of control
I'm out of control

They say I've got 123
Some kind of ABC
But that's all part of me
Hey, there's pills for that too

There's pills for heartache
There's pills to fall in love too
Go ahead, take a picture
I might as well be a statue
A tourist attraction
I just stand there and smile
Blank as a paper
There'll be no ups and no downs
You bet I'm stoned
You got me started
But now I'm cold
I'm stone cold-hearted
And I'm out of control
I'm out of control

They say I've got 123
Some kind of ABC
But that's all part of me
Hey, there's pills for that too

There's pills for heartache
There's pills to fall in love too
Go ahead, take a picture
I might as well be a statue
A tourist attraction
I just stand there and smile
Blank as a paper
There'll be no ups and no downs

Now here I am
I'm peeling off the stone
Yeah, piece by piece
The layer's falling off
I'm on my knees
My lips kissing the dirt
If this is me
Yeah I love the way it hurts
Yeah I love the way it hurts
Yeah I love the way it hurts
Yeah I love the way it hurts
Yeah I love the way it hurts
There's pills for heartache
There's pills to fall in love too
But I won't be takin' them
Hell no, I won't be a statue
If you take a picture
I will stand there and smile
Because I want to
I'll have my ups and my downs
