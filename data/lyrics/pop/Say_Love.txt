Folding down the seats in the back of my car
Got nowhere to be 'cause the world don't know where we are
3 A.M. and you're in my arms, all the drinks still wearing off
You look to me like I said something wrong, mmm

'Cause I opened my mouth
Now, we're both just sat in silence
Frozen by three little words
And there was something behind those eyes
That she was hiding
She said, "I don't want this to hurt"

Just don't say love, say love, say love, say love, no
I've heard that word misused a thousand times before
I know that we don't have to dive in
'Cause we got all of the time in the world
To say love, say love, say love, say love

Heart disappeared from my sleeve, I should've known
It's still way too early to see where this could go
She said, "I'm not tryna be difficult
And I've just never felt this before
Think I'm scared we might lose it all", mmm

Enclosed in that moment, I found a silver lining
All I've been looking for
'Cause there was something behind those eyes
That she was hiding
She said, "It's nothing personal"

Just don't say love, say love, say love, say love, no
I've heard that word misused a thousand times before
I know that we don't have to dive in
'Cause we got all of the time in the world
To say love, say love, say love, say love
So don't say love, say love, say love, say love

I'm not gonna run away
I'm not the type to leave you
On your own, on your own, all on your
I finally get what you're tryna say

Just don't say love, say love, say love, say love, no
I've heard that word misused a thousand times before
I know that we don't have to dive in
'Cause we got all of the time in the world
To say love, say love, say love, say love
Just don't say love, say love, say love, say love, no
I've heard that word misused a thousand times before
I know that we don't have to dive in
'Cause we got all of the time in the world
To say love, say love, say love, say love
To say love, say love, say love, say love
Don't say love, say love, say love, say love
