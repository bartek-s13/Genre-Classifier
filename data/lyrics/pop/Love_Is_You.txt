Love is you
You're its smile
Love is you
You're its child

You've taught me what it is to be somebody
And you gave life to a useless wandering body

Love, love is you
You're its smile
Yeah, love is you
You're its child

'Cause you touched me and I saw God's own heaven
And now I know, I'll stay with you forever

Love is you
Love is you

Love, don't make me feel afraid
I just wanna stay
'Cause you and me can make it together
Always cast away
Yeah, baby, you touched me and I saw endless heaven
And now I know, I'll stay with you, with you forever

Love (Love is) is you (Love is you)
You're its smile
Yeah, love (Love is) is you (Love is you)
You're its child
Yeah, baby, love (Love is) is you (Love is you)
You're its smile
Yeah, love (Love is) is you (Love is you)
You're its child

Love is you
Love is you
