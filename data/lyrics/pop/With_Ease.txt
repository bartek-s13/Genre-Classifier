ANH, what the fuck, bitch?
I'm trying to get rich as shit
I'ma pull up with a big bag and sew that shit up, gang

Neck so cold, hmm
Bitch, you said freeze (Hahaha)
Make another hit, yeah, did it with ease (Ooah)
Fit so clean, yeah, can you find a crease? (Skrt)
If you cutting bread, can I have another piece?
Ayy, poppin' out the bed, I’m making heaps of shit like everyday
Baby, cast the leviosa, now I'm gonna levitate
I'm making more than you make yearly solely off an interest rate
I know you slightly jelly of my neck, cause I'm a heavyweight

Big bag, big back yard, aye, ooh
12 cars (Yeah), six bad broads (Aye)
Billy pull up whippin' you'd think it was NASCAR (Skrt)
They see me winning, I get it, I'm too raw (What?)
Me and Baby pull up in a spaceship (Pew, pew)
This that new shit, all y'all bitches basic
Talkin' all that shit on the internet, let's face it
We're getting rich while you stuck in the basement (Yuh)
Now Billy famous
Pull up in a drop top coupe, that’s brainless
You be the background, we be in the a-list
Me and Baby chillin' with the some older ladies
I've been working way too hard
G-g-got a bitch in every state and a crib on mars
I've been eating so good, gotta watch the carbs
Couple thousand on the wrist, Billy, flex I'm a star, yah

Neck so cold, hmm
Bitch you said freeze (Hahaha)

Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vruum
