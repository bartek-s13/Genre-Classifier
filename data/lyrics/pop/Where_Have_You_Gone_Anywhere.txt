I'm gonna search for you all night long
Screaming I-I-I wanna know where you’ve gone
Ain't gonna stop 'cause the love’s too strong
Where do you hi-i-ide let know me where you've gone?

Where have you gone?
Let me know, I wanna know where you've gone
I'm gonna search for you all night long
Screaming I-I-I wanna know where you've gone
Let me know, I wanna know where you've gone

I'm so obsessed see you everywhere
Or will I-I-I tell them girls, I don't care
Can’t leave you down, meet me anywhere
A place isn’t I-I-I tell me and I'll be there

Where have you gone?
Let me know, I wanna know where you’ve gone
I'm gonna search for you all night long
Screaming I-I-I wanna know where you've gone
I'm gonna search for you all night long
Screaming I-I-I wanna know where you’ve gone
I'm gonna search for you all night long
Screaming I-I-I wanna know where you've gone
Ain't gonna stop cause the love's too strong
Where do you hi-i-ide let me know where you've gone
Where have you gone?
