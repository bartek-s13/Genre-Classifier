Tellin' me you love me, but I've heard it before
Stayin' out 'til the mornin', I can hear the door
Tellin' me you're different, but you're just like the rest
I can smell all the whiskey and the smoke on your breath

I don't think you know this, but you're so predictable
Textin' her behind my back and actin' like I don't
But I already know, oh, oh (Oh, oh)
Yeah, I already know this

'Cause you've been talkin' in your sleep, oh oh
And you've been messin' 'round on me (You've been messin' 'round on me)
I thought I told you once before, ooh
I guess you wasn't listening (I guess you wasn't listening)
I'll wait 'til the morning, might just let you sleep in
Won't give you a warning, just know that I'm leavin'
'Cause you've been talkin' in your sleep (You've been talkin'), oh oh
And you've been messin' 'round on me (On me, on me, ooh)

You say that you want me, that you want me back
Wanna talk to me, it's over, no, I won't do that
Swear that you're different, but you're still like the rest
Don't wanna talk it over, no
I don't think you know this, but you're so predictable
Textin' her behind my back and actin' like I don't
But I already know (Already know), oh, oh
Yeah, I already know this (Know this)

'Cause you've been talkin' in your sleep, oh, oh
And you've been messin' 'round on me (On me, on me)
I thought I told you once before, oh
I guess you wasn't listening
I'll wait till the morning, might just let you sleep in
Won't give you a warning, just know that I'm leavin'
'Cause you've been talkin' in your sleep (In your sleep, in your sleep)
And you've been messin' 'round on me (On me, on me), ooh

I don't think you know this, but you're so predictable
Textin' girls behind my back and actin' like you don't
But I already know, oh, oh
Yeah, I already know

'Cause you've been talkin' in your sleep (You've been talkin' in your sleep), oh, oh
And you've been messin' 'round on me (And you've been messin' 'round on me)
I thought I told you once before (I thought I told you once before), oh
I guess you wasn't listening (I guess you wasn't listening)
I'll wait 'til the morning (I'll wait 'til the morning)
Might just let you sleep in (Might just let you sleep in)
Won't give you a warning (Won't give you a warning)
Just know that I'm leavin'
'Cause you've been talkin' in your sleep (Your sleep, oh, oh)
And you've been messin' 'round on me (On me, on me), ooh
