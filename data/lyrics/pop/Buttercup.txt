(Won't you get out of my head?)
(Electrify my golden tooth)

Forget it, I'll do it sometime, ooh
I'm locked up on the button
Can't you do it sometime?
Pushed it in too far, oh

Fine, electrify mine, oh
Electrify my golden tooth
Can't look at your eyes
Without sparking some...

Electrify my heart-art-art-art-art-art-oh-ooh-ooh
Electrify my heart-art-art-art-art-art-oh-ooh-ooh
(Yeah, haha)

(Yeah)
Surprise, I'm in the same time, o-ah
Beneath the same sun (Oh yeah)
Oh man, you cut me to size (Ow)
My little buttercup (That hurt)

Fine, electrify mine
Electrify my golden tooth
Can't look at those eyes
Without sparking some...

Electrify my heart-art-art-art-art-art-oh-ooh-ooh
Electrify my heart-art-art-art-art-art-oh-ooh-ooh
Electrify my heart-art-art-art-art-art-oh-ooh-ooh
Electrify my heart-art-art-art-art-art-oh-ooh-ooh

(Oh)
(Please, so)
(Ple—)
