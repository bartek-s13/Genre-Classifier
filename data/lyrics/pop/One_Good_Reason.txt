We used to lay in bed all tangled up
But now we sleep on separate sides
We don't talk but still we call it love
It’s like we're leading different lives

Can you push away when I hold you close?
Say it to my face if you wanna go
Or if you're gonna fight for me, let me know
’Cause I don't wanna lose you this way

Give me one good reason I should stay
Or give me one good reason to walk away
I've lost my religion, lost my faith
Why can't you just say what you wanna say?
Give me one good reason
Why can't you just say what you wanna say?
Give me one good

I used to hang on every word you said
But now our words don't come out right
And when we talk, it's just the same again
Why's it so hard to say goodbye?
Give me one good reason I should stay
Or give me one good reason to walk away
I’ve lost my religion, lost my faith
Why can’t you just say what you wanna say?
Give me one good reason
Give me one good reason, mmm
Give me one good reason
Why can't you just say what you wanna say?
Oh, oh, oh
Why can’t you just say what you wanna say?

Give me one good reason I should stay
Or give me one good reason to walk away
I've lost my religion, lost my faith
Why can't you just say what you wanna say?

Give me one good reason
Give me one good reason, oh
Give me one good reason
Why can't you just say what you wanna say?
Give me one good reason I should stay
Or give me one good reason to walk away
I’ve lost my religion, lost my faith
