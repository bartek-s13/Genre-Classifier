Summer right before
The year
I fell apart
I'd drive out to your house
In my dad’s minivan
Listening to Channel Orange
I don't know what is wrong with me
I wish that I was back in high school
I miss my giant group of friends
And skating around not caring about anything
I wish I had more to say
I wish I wasn't sad at night
I wish I liked going out more
But I'm ok

You don't care
About what's mine
All turned up, it's whatcha do, whatcha do
You don't care
About what's mine
Do what's right
Don't fall down
Everything feels so far away, away
Floating around
Living in someone else's house
Don't fall down
Don't fall down

You don't care
About what's mine
All turned up, it's whatcha do, whatcha do
You don't care
About what's mine
Do what's right
Don't fall down

You don't care
About what's mine
All turned up, it's whatcha do, whatcha do
You don't care
About what's mine
Do what's right
Don't fall
You don't care
About what's mine
All turned up, it's whatcha do, whatcha do
You don't care
About what's mine
Do what's right

You don't care
About what's mine
Do what's right
Don't fall
You don't care
About what's mine
