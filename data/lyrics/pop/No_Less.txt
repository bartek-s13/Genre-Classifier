Follow me, my darling
I'm on the rise
See my songs
Playing on their minds
Now believe, my darling
Feel it inside
See my name
And all those flashing lights

I believe, I believe, I beli-eee-eve (I believe)
I'ma be, I'ma be, I'ma be the one you need
I believe, I believe, I beli-eee-eve
And I will show you that

I won't settle for no less
Give you my hardest, no rest
I just wanna do you right
I hold heaven in both hands
Give you my hardest, no rest
I just wanna do you right, girl
I just wanna do you right

Follow me, my lady
Just follow my lead
To higher ground, there's a way around
If you dare to believe
You're all I want
And all I want is you
If you're holding on
It's me you hold on to

I believe, I believe, I beli-eee-eve (I believe)
I'ma be, I'ma be, I'ma be the one you need
I believe, I believe, I beli-eee-eve
And I will show you that

I won't settle for no less
Give you my hardest, no rest
I just wanna do you right
I hold heaven in both hands
Give you my hardest, no rest
I just wanna do you right, girl
I just wanna do you right

And I will bring you all my rights
I just wanna do you right, yeah
I won't leave you down and out behind me
I just wanna do you right, I just wanna do you right
I just wanna do you right, girl
I just wanna do you right
I just wanna do you right, girl
I just wanna do you right
