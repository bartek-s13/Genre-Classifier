Most days, I wake up with a pit in my chest
There are thoughts that I can't put to rest
There's a worry that I can't place
Most nights, I am restless and quiet won't come
So I lay there and wait for the sun
There's a trouble that won't show its face

You came out of nowhere and you cut through all the noise
I make sense of the madness when I listen to your voice

Darling, only you can ease my mind
Help me leave these lonely thoughts behind
When they pull me under, and I can feel my sanity start to unwind
Darling, only you can ease my mind

I'll admit, for a moment, I felt so afraid
Just to show you the mess that I made
There are pieces I usually hide
But when you collect me with your steady hand
With a language that I understand
I feel put back together inside
You came out of nowhere and you cut through all the noise
I make sense of the madness when I listen to your voice

Oh, darling, only you can ease my mind
Oh, help me leave these lonely thoughts behind
When they pull me under, and I can feel my sanity start to unwind
Darling, only you can ease my mind
Darling, only you can ease my mind
Help me leave these lonely thoughts behind
When they pull me under, and I can feel my sanity start to unwind
