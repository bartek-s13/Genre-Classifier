Yeah

I've been (Yuh), I've been thinking I can't function, uh
And lately (Yeah), that's all been because of you, ayy
So I smoke up (Yeah), I try to pull myself above it, uh
Just forget it (Yeah), I don't even care if it's true

I'm way too high for this (Yeah, oh I do)
I don't have time for this (Yeah, oh I do)
I'm way too high for this (Yeah, oh I do)
I don't have time for this (Yeah, oh I do)

Yeah
Yeah, I had a bad dream about you last night
But I didn't lose sleep, no, I slept a full night
You were passive and aggressive all at the same time
And you wonder why I'm red in the eyes

Now I can't think of anything else
Ask me if I'm okay
If I'm honest, I just can't tell

I'm way too high for this (Yeah, oh I do, uh)
I don't have time for this (Yeah, oh I do)
I'm way too high for this (Yeah, oh I do)
I don't have time for this (Yeah, oh I do)

I know I said that first of all
I'd never make this personal
I swear to God, I'm doing my best
I said I wouldn't bring this up again
It's hard because you work with him
At least you said you didn't have sex
Now I can't think of anything else
I'd rather be up here than stuck in this hell

I'm way too high for this (Yeah, oh I do)
I don't have time for this (Yeah, oh I do)
I'm way too high for this (Yeah, oh I do)
