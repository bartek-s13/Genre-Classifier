I know you tried to cut out the noise
To get me to hear the love in your voice
But I was so deaf to all but myself
So you just went silent and stopped trying to help

It took a while to realise but things are clearer over time
And those mistakes we made were mine

But what if, what if we'd held on for longer?
Or what if, what if breaking made us stronger?
Either way, I'm contemplating if there's a way to get you back
'Cause every day I'm tired of thinking what if, what if, what if, what if

Well I know you tried to get me to see
Myself in the mirror the way that you saw me
But I was so blind, that all I could do
Was think that my darkness was the shadow of you

But what if, what if we'd held on for longer?
Or what if, what if breaking made us stronger?
Either way, I'm contemplating if there's a way to get you back
'Cause every day I'm tired of thinking what if, what if, what if
Every day I learn to love you a little more
And every day, I swear to give you what I never gave before
If every day I learn to love you a little more
And every day, I swear to give you what I never gave before
What I never gave before

So what if, what if, what if, what if, what if, what if

What if, what if we'd held on for longer?
What if, what if breaking made us stronger?
Either way, I'm contemplating if there's a way to get you back
'Cause every day I'm tired of thinking what if, what if, what if

Every day I learn to love you a little more
And every day, I swear to give you what I never gave before
If every day I learn to love you a little more
And every day, I swear to give you what I never gave before
