I, I can't see you so close
If she wins the dust caves in
I, I remember the most
The time spent in that family of it

Shut it, go
I won't know
So how can I hear my friends in the mahjong room?

I hear your shoes creeping in
You, me, , but
I, I forgot how to play
With those strangers and your strangers

Shut it, go
I won't know
How can I hear my friends in the mahjong room?

Mahjong room
Mahjong room
I'm playing in the mahjong room
I'm singing in the mahjong room
I'm playing in the mahjong room
Hear my friends in the mahjong room
I'm playing in the mahjong room
Sing it with me, I'm in the mahjong room
