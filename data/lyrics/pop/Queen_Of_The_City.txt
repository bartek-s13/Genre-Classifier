If I wrote it in your letter then it don't mean shit
I am a liar, a dirty wire
You could name my body but it'll make you sick
You have a savior it's your heart of anger
But my dog ain't nothin', he ain't nothin' like my lover
Ain't nothin' like my lover at all
He will sit upon my shoulder, let the dark day cover
The dark day cover me up
I've got two half dollars underneath my bed
One for my baby, one for the lady
On the sixth floor found me when my mind was dead
Buy what they tell you but I'm here to save you
I heard a lady singing
“We're all bound together!”
I joined her side by saying
“To dance beneath the heavens!”
Christ, your mother's hanging on my bedroom door
I'll bet she's pretty, Queen of the City
If you burn all sinners I could join your corp
And sing HOLY, HOLY till my day of glory
But my Lord ain't nothin', you ain't nothin' like my lover
Ain't nothin' like my lover at all
You could sit upon my shoulder, let the dark day cover
