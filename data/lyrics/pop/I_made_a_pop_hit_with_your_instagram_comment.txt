We were laughing in our bed
But bitchin in our head
We meet at in the rain
And I still never knew her name
Don’t worry don’t cry
Drink vodka and fly
I was getting drunk enough to forget my name
I think Peter Pan and me are just the same
You’re in fire you’re hot (no no no no no)
All that you are is all that I need
This world just goes faster than it seems
And tell me how can I escape without your help
No I don’t care baby i just wanna dance
Im in love with you
Everyday was lit
Just going with the flow
Through of you everyday
Till you turn around and say
Enjoy your life buddy
All that you are is all that I need
At this moment I knew
I knew I fucked up
And tell me how can I escape without your help
No I don’t care baby i just wanna dance
Im in love with you(x2)
Im in love (x2)
