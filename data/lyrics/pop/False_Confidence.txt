Don't take yourself so seriously
Look at you all dressed up for someone you never see
You're here for a reason but you don't know why
You're split and uneven, your hands to the sky
Surrender yourself

And I wonder why I tear myself down to be built back up again
Oh, I hope somehow, I'll wake up young again
All that's left of myself, holes in my false confidence
And now I lay myself down and hope I wake up young again

Hope I wake up young again

Don't let those demons in again
I fill the void up with polished doubt, fake sentiment
Surrender yourself

And I wonder why I tear myself down to be built back up again
Oh, I hope somehow, I'll wake up young again
All that's left of myself, holes in my false confidence
And now I lay myself down and hope I wake up young again

Hope I wake up young again
Hope I wake up young again

Why won't you take me seriously?
Look at me all fucked up over someone I'll never meet

And I wonder why I tear myself down to be built back up again
Oh, I hope somehow, I'll wake up young again
All that's left of myself, holes in my false confidence
And now I lay myself down and hope I wake
I wonder why I tear myself down to be built back up again
Oh, I hope somehow I wake up young again
All that's left of myself, holes in my false confidence
And now I lay myself down and hope I wake up young again

Hope I wake up young again
