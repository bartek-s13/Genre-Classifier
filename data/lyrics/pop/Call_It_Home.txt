If I don't own up to myself
Who will be waiting for me?
Checking up on my mental health
Writing that one great story

'Cause why should I be so keen to try?

It's alright if you don't go
Stay inside, call it home

Sit like a dog in Norway
Scout out the time and place tonight
Will they be waiting for me?
There's probably better things to try

But I'm wanting it more than I told you
Can't sleep, won't sleep
But I cannot wait any longer
It's too late, too deep

'Cause why should I be so keen to try?
It's alright if you don't go
Stay inside, call it home
Stop your crying, just say so
When you're here, call it home
It's alright if you don't go
Stay inside, call it home
Stop your crying, just say so
When you're here, call it home
