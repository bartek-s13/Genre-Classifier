There were too many people at the party making faces
I don't wanna be a part of it with the beautiful people
And there you were drinking Coca-Cola
Shaking your Polaroid picture
Don't try to explain it, I think that we feel the same here
And all the girls must be models here, sipping up on margaritas
Twist their bodies so beautiful, making shapes with the music
He got it all in a photograph and he marked it with Nikon
Named it "A Boy in the Zoo", kissed me deeply, here, that’s for you

Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh

But all I wanna know is
What you think about me, arty boy?
All I wanna know is
What you think about me, arty boy?

And there were too many people at the party in bikinis
They poured their Belvedere vodka into their small glass martinis
And there you were in the corner, smoking a cloud just for cover
His name engraved in his flask, so I don’t have to ask
And all the girls must be dancers, they’re getting up on the tables
Turning their bodies to liquid, so smooth in all the right places
He held a thumb with his fingers and blinked an eye for the trigger
And said, "Girl in the zoo, I’m glad that’s not you"
But all I wanna know is
What you think about me, arty boy?
All I wanna know is
What you think about me, arty boy?
All I wanna know is
What you think about me, arty boy?
All I wanna know is
What you think about me, arty boy?

Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh

Oh, every part of me wants every part of you
Oh, you're so different, you're my perfect kind of fool
Oh, every part of me wants every part of you
'Cause you're so different, you're my perfect kind of fool

All I wanna know is
What you think about me, arty boy?
All I wanna know is
What you think about me, arty boy?
All I wanna know is
What you think about me, arty boy?
All I wanna know is
What you think about me, arty boy?
Arty boy
Arty boy
