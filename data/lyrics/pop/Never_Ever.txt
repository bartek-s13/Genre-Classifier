<<<<<<< HEAD
I never ever, I never ever meant to catch you in a lie
You never ever, you never ever had the heart to say it right

With my phone turned off, it makes no sound
But you said you needed space
'Cause your phone's turned off, I come around
'Cause I just need to say

I swear I never ever, but that's just what you do
When you love somebody, love someone
I could try to make it better, but that's just how it is
When you hurt somebody, love someone

But I like you better from afar
I think we're better off apart
You called it payback
You only say that with my brother in your bed
You think you're clever
Would I be better fucking someone else instead?

With my phone turned off, it makes no sound
But I still hear your voice
'Cause you're so turned off, I come around
'Cause you leave me no choice
I swear I never ever, but that's just what you do
When you love somebody, love someone
I could try to make it better, but that's just how it is
When you hurt somebody, love someone

(I like you better)
I'm feeling better already, you'd do better to forget me
(I like you better)
Right from the moment you left me, now it don't bother me any

I swear I never ever, but that's just what you do
When you love somebody, love someone
I could try to make it better, but that's just how it is
When you hurt somebody, love someone
I swear I never ever, but that's just what you do
When you love somebody, love someone
I could try to make it better, but that's just how it is
When you hurt somebody, love someone
I swear I never ever, but that's just what you do
When you love somebody, love someone
I could try to make it better, but that's just how it is
When you hurt somebody, love someone
