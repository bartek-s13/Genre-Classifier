Da da da, da da da

You keep on coming up with lies
And saying sorry, da da da
Sorry, da da da, sorry, da da da
But I ain't buying all your lying
You ain't sorry, da da da
Sorry, da da da, sorry, da da da

Hey baby girl, what you doing?
Give you my world, but you screwed me
Gone crying, crying
I can't believe I'm crying for you

Don't crying, why you stalking me?
I meant it when I said goodbye
Don't crying, now you ain't listening
I don't know why I'm wasting my time



So let's go, let's go separate ways
You and me, we had our days
It's OK so don't you say
"Sorry, da da da"
Leave me, leave me all alone
Stop it, stop calling my phone
Time to grown on on your own
Sorry, da da da

You ain't sorry, da da da
Don't give me sorry, da da da
Don't crying, don't crying

Da da da, da da da

You keep on coming up with lies
And saying sorry, da da da
Sorry, da da da, sorry, da da da
But I ain't buying all your lying
You ain't sorry, da da da
Sorry, da da da, sorry, da da da

Hey baby girl, what you doing?

Don't crying, don't crying
