I hear the birds when they're singing
I hear the sirens when they're ringing
But I can't take my mind off of you
A thousand words pour out of my mouth
Distance over depth is proven unannounced
Is it real? Cause I don't feel alright

I got this notion
In the deepest ocean
Calling out my name
Screaming out in vain
Singing hallelujah

Tell your mother she don't understand
Tell your mother she's not listening
Why don't you tie my heart with chains made of string
I rolled the dice
You sealed the deal
That don't matter
The pain is real
I won't follow you
Into the dark
I got this notion
In the deepest ocean
Calling out my name
Screaming out in vain
Singing hallelujah
These notions
Hmm, in the deepest as ocean
Calling out my name
Screaming out in vain
Singing hallelujah

Singing hallelujah to you
Calling out my name
I'm in the deepest ocean
Calling out my name
Singing hallelujah to you
