Just like a slot machine
Honey, you had your greedy little hands on me
Crushed, thought you’d cum for free
Sorry, I almost had to file for bankruptcy

And I wasted all those summer nights
In Disneyland, my ride or die
On you
You raised your hand and testified
Then took my credit card and swiped
How rude, so rude

(Pay me back!)
Witness stand, can’t you be an honest man
(Pay me back!)
I’m in debt, never chipped in with the rent
(Pay me back!)
Movie nights and romantic dinner plans
Wish that I could cash that check
So pay me back!

(Pay me back!)
Wish that I could cash that check
So pay me
Damn, I’m no ATM
But you want all my money like you’re Uncle Sam
Can’t you just understand
Oh man, you never grow up like you’re Peter Pan

And I wasted all those summer nights
In Disneyland, my ride or die
On you
You raised your hand and testified
Then took my credit card and swiped
How rude, so rude (How rude, how rude)

(Pay me back!)
Witness stand, can’t you be an honest man
(Pay me back!)
I’m in debt, never chipped in with the rent
(Pay me back!)
Movie nights and romantic dinner plans
Wish that I could cash that check
So pay me back!

(Pay me back!)
Wish that I could cash that check
So pay me
I been cooking and cleaning for ya
Thought it would last forever
Now I’m broke waving Sayonara
Can you do me, do me what
Can you do me one last favor

(Pay me back!)
Witness stand, can’t you be an honest man
(Pay me back!)
I’m in debt, never chipped in with the rent
(Pay me back!)
Movie nights and romantic dinner plans
Wish that I could cash that check
So pay me back!
(Oh yeah yeah)

(Pay me back!)
Wish that I could cash that check
So pay me back!
