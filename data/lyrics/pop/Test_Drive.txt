I never normally check my phone 10 times in a minute
I'm not the girl to be kept on hold 10 miles from the finish
But you got me losing all my cool
Somehow I've given up all control
I'm not shy to admit it

'Cause I don't really mind, just don't make me your test drive for the weekend
'Cause I'm looking for just a little more than a joyride in the evening
Don't need to run around town with you every night
You can pick me up whenever you like
'Cause I don't really mind, just don't make me your test drive for the weekend

Test drive, test drive
Test drive, test drive

They're telling me not to fall too hard 'cause I'm bound to regret it
Warning me to keep up my guard, but each time I forget it
'Cause girl, they don't know you like I do
I see a different side to you

'Cause I don't really mind, just don't make me your test drive for the weekend
'Cause I'm looking for just a little more than a joyride in the evening
Don't need to run around town with you every night
You can pick me up whenever you like
'Cause I don't really mind, just don't make me your test drive for the weekend

This is not normal, I hear them calling
It's a bit out of character for me
Fuck what they're saying, my mind ain't changing
Weighed it all up and I know the dangers
Know I got you and know you got me
That's all that we need, we're running off fumes
I know, I won't let you go

'Cause I don't really mind, just don't make me your test drive for the weekend
'Cause I'm looking for just a little more than a joyride in the evening
Don't need to run around town with you every night
You can pick me up whenever you like
'Cause I don't really mind, just don't make me your test drive for the weekend

Test drive, test drive
Test drive, test drive for the weekend
Test drive, test drive
Test drive, test drive for the weekend
