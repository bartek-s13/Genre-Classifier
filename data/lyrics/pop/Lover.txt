I just wanna be your lover
You know that we ain't friends
Yeah, I tried to love another
It never made much sense
I just wanna be your lover
You know that we ain't friends
You know that we ain't, know that we ain't

My birthday, haven't heard a thing from you
You haven't wished a single thing or two
Don't wanna be another page in your bible
I am your final, I am your title
I am the one who is gonna make you feel it right
And now we're falling back to old ways
Saying shit we used to say
But baby, you have someone that is there right by your side
Honestly I don't know how you sleep at night
How do you sleep at night?

I just wanna be your lover
You know that we ain't friends
Yeah, I tried to love another
It never made much sense
I just wanna be your lover
You know that we ain't friends
You know that we ain't, know that we ain't

When we're all alone and the lights are low
I'm gonna make you scream, gonna make you scream
When we're all alone and the lights are low
I'm gonna make you scream, gonna make you scream
When we're all alone (Never made much sense)
Give it to me

I just wanna be your lover
You know that we ain't friends
Yeah, I tried to love another
It never made much sense
I just wanna be your lover
You know that we ain't friends
Yeah, I tried to love another
It never made much

When we're all alone and the lights are low
Yeah, it's you and me, yeah, it's you and me
When we're all alone and the lights are low
Yeah, it's you and me, yeah, it's you and me
When we're all alone and the lights are low
I'm gonna make you scream, I'm gonna make you scream
When we're all alone and the lights are low (Yeah)
All alone, alone
