Yeah, she said don't go to your old ways
I been working all day
Nothing left for me at home
I'm overseas, I'm out the state
But this the life we always asked for
Way too many stamps up in my passport
But, baby, take a look at me right now
Golden teeth glow when I smile
Diamonds shine up on my face
When I step up and rock up a crowd
Yeah, this the life we always asked for
Yeah, this the life we always asked for

I know that they wanna see me fall, yeah
I'm just being honest
Don't you put the blame on me
And I can hear my demons calling
Why they always talking?
Don't you put the blame on me
Yeah, this is the shit you don't see on screen, oh yeah
Looking for something to believe and move on with
Yeah, I know that they wanna see me fall, yeah
I'm just being honest
Don't you put the blame on me
Don't put the blame on me
I been living good, I been living great
Put the blame on me, I just can't relate
With the words that you went and said
Yeah, I can't let this pressure creep into my head
Yeah, all these girls gon' break me much more than I meant
But you know I got lost last night, I feel wrong
Hold me close I feel right
Break me until nothing's left
Yeah, this the life we always asked for
Yeah, this the life we always asked for

I know that they wanna see me fall, yeah
I'm just being honest
Don't you put the blame on me
And I can hear my demons calling
Why they always talking?
Don't you put the blame on me
Yeah, this is the shit you don't see on screen, oh yeah
Looking for something to believe and move on with
Yeah, I know that they wanna see me fall, yeah
I'm just being honest
Don't you put the blame on me
Don't put the blame on me
Yeah, I know that they wanna see me fall, yeah
I'm just being honest
Don't you put the blame on me
And I can hear my demons calling
Why they always talking?
Don't you put the blame on me
Yeah, this is the shit you don't see on screen, oh yeah
Looking for something to believe and move on with
Yeah, I know that they wanna see me fall, yeah
I'm just being honest
Don't you put the blame on me
Don't put the blame on me
