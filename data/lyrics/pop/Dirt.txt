I've got dirt on you
I've got dirt on you
I've got dirt on you
I've got, I've got, I've got

I was having such a good time
By the pool, sipping on wine
Then you came on Twitter
Saying I'm bitter 
(Honey, have you looked in the mirror?)
Never thought you'd stoop so low
How far down will you go?
On me, online, all the time
Can't write you back, gotta catch my flight

I'm going somewhere new
Somewhere you've never been to
This altitude ain't the only thing I got over you

Do you know I got dirt on you?
Don't make me spill it
I've got tea for two
And bitch I'm gonna sip it
No, you know somebody's gonna come out of this fight on top
It's gonna be you with the bruises
'Cause I've got dirt on you
I've got dirt on you
I've got dirt on you
I've got dirt on, I've got, I've got
I've got dirt on you

Now, you're up in my face, getting irate
You were so sweet, what changed?
Yes, things go sour after they pass their sell-by date (ooh)
The sun is casting rays, so let me serve some shade
Using my name for fame, and yet you say you're self-made honey

And when I count to three
You'd best be on your knees
Don't you try coming for me
'Cause I'm the bitch who keeps her receipts (Hey!)

Do you know I got dirt on you?
Don't make me spill it
I've got tea for two
And bitch I'm gonna sip it
No, you know somebody's gonna come out of this fight on top
It's gonna be you with the bruises
'Cause I've got dirt on you
I've got dirt on you
I've got dirt on you
I've got dirt on, I've got, I've got
I've got dirt on you

I've got dirt on you
I've got dirt on you
I've got dirt on, I've got, I've got
I've got dirt on you

If you keep looking then you're gonna find me
You turn it around on me, so I turn it around on you
If you keep looking, you won't like what you see
Keep pushing your lies on me, gonna show that I'm bulletproof
(1, 2, 3)

Do you know I got dirt on you? (dirt, yeah!)
Don't make me spill it
I've got tea for two (tea for two)
And bitch I'm gonna sip it
No, you know somebody's gonna come out of this fight on top
It's gonna be you with the bruises
'Cause I've got dirt on you
I've got dirt on you (dirt on you!)
I've got dirt on you
I've got dirt on, I've got, I've got (tea for two)
I've got dirt on you (1, 2 ,3, hey!)

I've got dirt on you (dirt on you!)
I've got dirt on you
I've got dirt on, I've got, I've got (tea for two)
