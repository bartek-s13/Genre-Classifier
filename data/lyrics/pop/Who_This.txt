Lil Nut
Aay
Aay

Making lil’ dick trap
Bring the whip back
Rollin’ in Toyota Corollas, nobody flexin’ on me
They don’t wanna see me
But then I nut in their eye and I’m making ‘em cry and clean it so they gotta see (so they gotta see)
Making lean cuisines and playing 2K
Only shooters on my team, nobody coming for me (aay)
Hang me from my fuckin’ family tree
Cause ain’t nobody coming after gonna be better than me, aay

Who this? Who this? Young Nut and I’m not stoppin’
Fuck a bitch, I stick my dick in a Hot Pocket
Since the very first song I been poppin’
Who this? Who this? Yeah aye
Who this? Who this? Young Nut and I’m not stoppin’
Fuck a bitch, I stick my dick in a Hot Pocket
Since the very first song I been poppin’
Who this? Who this? Yeah aye
Now they got Young Nut on top
And I got your girl on bottom
All I do is take chances
‘Cause I ain't got no problems
Fucked a girl and broke my dick
Now I’m eating Triscuits
Married to the game, never change
I still got a mistress
Who this? Who this? It’s Young Nut from Phoenix
Lyrics dumb, but damn my flow is the cleanest
They got me out here putting Phoenix on the map
Get the chorus, bring it back
Young Nut fuck the world and then I give it the clap
Aay

Who this? Who this? Young Nut and I’m not stoppin’
Fuck a bitch, I stick my dick in a Hot Pocket
Since the very first song I been poppin’
Who this? Who this? Yeah aye
