I don't tell anyone about the way you hold my hand
I don't tell anyone about the things that we have planned
I won't tell anybody, won't tell anybody
They wanna push me down, they wanna see you fall down
Won't tell anybody how you turn my world around
I won't tell anyone how your voice is my favourite sound
I won't tell anybody, won't tell anybody
They wanna see us fall, they wanna see us fall down

I don't need a parachute
Baby, if I've got you
Baby, if I've got you
I don't need a parachute
You're gonna catch me
You're gonna catch if I fall
Down, down, down
I don't need a parachute
Baby, if I've got you
Baby, if I've got you
I don't need a parachute
You're gonna catch me
You're gonna catch if I fall
Down, down, down
Don't believe the things you tell yourself so late at night and
You are your own worst enemy, you'll never win the fight
Just hold on to me, I'll hold on to you
It's you and me up against the world, it's you and me
Go

I don't need a parachute
Baby, if I've got you
Baby, if I've got you
I don't need a parachute
You're gonna catch me
You're gonna catch if I fall
Down, down, down
I don't need a parachute
Baby, if I've got you
Baby, if I've got you
I don't need a parachute
You're gonna catch me
You're gonna catch if I fall
Down, down, down

I won't fall out of love, I won't fall out of
I won't fall out of love, I won't fall out of
I won't fall out of love, I won't fall out of
I won't fall out of love, I'll fall into you
I won't fall out of love, I won't fall out of (I won't fall out of love, love)
I won't fall out of love, I won't fall out of (I won't fall out of love, love)
I won't fall out of love, I won't fall out of (I won't fall out of love, love)
I won't fall out of love, I'll fall into you
I don't need a parachute
Baby, if I've got you
Baby, if I've got you
I don't need a parachute
You're gonna catch me
You're gonna catch if I fall
Down, down, down
I don't need a parachute
Baby, if I've got you
Baby, if I've got you
I don't need a parachute
You're gonna catch me
You're gonna catch if I fall
Down, down, down
