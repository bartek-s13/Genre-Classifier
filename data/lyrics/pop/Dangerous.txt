You're dangerous, boy, but I love it
Something about you, I can’t place it
The feeling of your eyes on me is magic
The spell you cast on me got me captured

When I am close to you, my spirit leaks
Something in the way you move moves me
So give me your lovin' 'fore my body turns to stone
Feelings came from nothing but I cannot move on

You’re dangerous, boy, but I love it
Something about you, I can't place it
The feeling of your eyes on me is magic
The spell you cast on me got me captured

Oh, you're dangerous
Mm, mm, mm
You're dangerous (Yeah)
Mm, mm, mm (Yeah, yeah)

Twist that knife, make my life
I won't lie, I won't lie
I could right but I don't
Waste the time on this side of the bed
That you don't wanna wake up
Got a mask full of makeup
’Cause I don’t wanna stay up with you

Oh, you're dangerous
Mm, mm, mm
You’re dangerous
Mm, mm, mm (Oh, oh)
You're dangerous
You're dangerous
Mm, mm, mm
