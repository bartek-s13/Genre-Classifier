I remember the quote, I didn't understand it at the time. I failed to achieve any degree of understanding in the ensuing years, which are three in number
I presume Herb means that inherently you cannot be commercial and artistic; you cannot be commercial concurrent with having a preoccupation with the level of storytelling that you want to achieve. And this, I have to reject
I don't think calling something 'commercial' tags it with a kind of an odious suggestion that it stinks, that it's something raunchy, to be ashamed of. I don't think if you say 'commercial' means to be publicly acceptable, what's wrong with that?
As long as you are not ashamed of anything you write if you're a writer, as long as you're not ashamed of anything you perform if you're an actor, and I'm not ashamed of anything
This is the area I know
But I think innate in what Herb says is the suggestion made by many people that you can't have public acceptance and still be artistic. And, as I said, I have to reject that

Just two bodies
Just two bodies
I've been so ready to dim my mind

Come over or not
I've been so ready to dim my mind
Your body, a drug for mine
Two bodies moving in time and space
To try and heal me
I know what I want, so come over and

Hold me, I won't ask for anything more
I'm hurting, use me now when I'm vulnerable
It helps me fake some love for a little while
I know what I want, so take advantage of me
I don't mind if you take advantage of me
So take advantage of me
You're closed, you're a book
No lines, can't read you if I tried
And if that's the way you want it
That's fine, I'll just close my eyes
And try to ignore you
A free ride for you to

Hold me, I won't ask for anything more
I'm hurting, use me now when I'm vulnerable
It helps me fake some love for a little while
I know what I want, so take advantage of me
I don't mind if you take advantage of me
So take advantage of me

Just two bodies
Just two bodies
Just two bodies

Hold me, I won't ask for anything more
I'm hurting, use me now when I'm vulnerable
It helps me fake some love for a little while
I know what I want, so take advantage of
Hold me, I won't ask for anything more
I'm hurting, use me now when I'm vulnerable
It helps me fake some love for a little while
I know what I want, so take advantage of
Hold me, I won't ask for anything more
I'm hurting, use me now when I'm vulnerable
It helps me fake some love for a little while
I know what I want, so take advantage of me
I don't mind if you take advantage of me, oh
So take advantage of me
