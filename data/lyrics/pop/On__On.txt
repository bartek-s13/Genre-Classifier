Blood rush, lighting me up
Your skin, fire
Now smoke is filling my lungs
My heart is tired

But we wait, keep telling ourselves
To keep on pushing when it hurts like hell
And it hurts like hell

On and on and on and on and on
Time is wasted, wasted
Holding on and on and on and on and on
I've tried, I've tried
We keep bleeding all the meaning out of love
And you're nowhere, going nowhere
Going on and on and on
On and on and on and on

What's wrong with giving up
White flag, surrender
Let go, fall out of love
Put out these embers

But we try, keep telling ourselves
To keep on pushing when it hurts like hell
And it hurts like hell

On and on and on and on and on
Time is wasted, wasted
Holding on and on and on and on and on
I've tried, I've tried
We keep bleeding all the meaning out of love
And you're nowhere, going nowhere
Going on and on and on
On and on and on and on

Oh, it's not enough, it's not enough
Oh, it's not enough, it's not enough
It's not enough

On and on and on and on and on
Time is wasted, wasted
Holding on and on and on and on and on
I've tried, I've tried
We keep bleeding all the meaning out of love
And you're nowhere, going nowhere
Going on and on and on
On and on and on and on

Going on and on and on
On and on and on and on
