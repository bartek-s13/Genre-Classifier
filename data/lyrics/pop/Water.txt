I've been swimming through the noise
But somehow I hear your voice breaking through
I'm a frozen castaway
Catching fire from everything that you do, oh

There was a desert in my soul
But now my river overflows
And I drown to get a little bit closer
Drawn to the flames
Ain't nobody like you

You got me falling like the rain
As my body turns to water, water
Got me feeling your heatwave
Girl you turn my ice to water, water
When you talk it keeps getting harder
Every word is taking me higher
Closer to the sun when I'm with you
You got me falling like the rain
As my body turns to water, water

I'm the canvas, you're the art
It's a mess when we're apart
So lost, no
When I see your silhouette
It's like sirens in my head
Setting off, whoa
There was a desert in my soul
But now my river overflows
And I drown to get a little bit closer
Drawn to the flames
Ain't nobody like you

You got me falling like the rain
As my body turns to water, water
Got me feeling your heatwave
Girl you turn my ice to water, water
When you talk it keeps getting harder
Every word is taking me higher
Closer to the sun when I'm with you
You got me falling like the rain
As my body turns to water, water

Drawn to the flame
Ain't nobody like you

Got me falling like the rain
As my body turns to water
You got me falling like the rain
As my body turns to water, water
Got me feeling your heatwave
Girl you turn my ice to water, water
When you talk it keeps getting harder
Every word is taking me higher
Closer to the sun when I'm with you
You got me falling like the rain
As my body turns to water, water
