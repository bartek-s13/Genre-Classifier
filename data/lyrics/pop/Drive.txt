Who's gonna tell you when
It's too late
Who's gonna tell you things
Aren't so great
You can't go on, thinkin'
Nothing's wrong, but bye
Who's gonna drive u home?
Tonight
Who's gonna pick you up
When you fall?
Who's gonna hang it up
When you call?
Who's gonna pay attention
To your dreams?
And who's gonna plug their ears
When you scream?
You can't go on, thinkin'
Nothing's wrong, but bye
Who's gonna drive u home?
Tonight
And though you can't go on, thinkin'
Nothing's wrong, but bye
Who's gonna drive u home?
Tonight
