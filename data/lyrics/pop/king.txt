Yeah yeah
Paranoid, you got me figured out
Paranoid, come down, it's much too loud
Paranoid, too long we lived with doubt
I've never run 'til right now

You know that I'm hiding, can't be long
Shadows that I'm fighting make me strong
This throne in my mind is keeping me going
Farther than the reach of time

So she said, "Baby, it's all in your head
It's in your mind, I guess"
This baroness, she always seems to know best
I bet she's my common sense

Paranoid, you'll all see when I'm down
Paranoid, among a troubled crowd
Polaroid, your pictures fading
Too quickly now with the sound

You know that I'm hiding, can't be long
Her warm touch invites me, makes me strong
The morning in my mind is keeping me going
Farther than the reach of time
So she said, "Baby, it's all in your head
It's in your mind, I guess"
This baroness, she always seems to know best
I bet she's my common sense

Bow down, bow down
Bow down, bow down
Bow down for me if you want it
Bow down, bow down
Bow down, bow down
Bow down, bow down
Yeah

So she said, "Baby, it's all in your head
It's in your mind, I guess"
This baroness, she always seems to know best
I bet she's my common sense
So she said, "Baby, it's all in your head
It's in your mind, I guess" (Bow down for me if you want it)
This baroness, she always seems to know best
I bet she's my common sense
