<<<<<<< HEAD
Tryna win all my time (na, na)
Pullin' me to the side, you're so bad
Don't wanna hear 'bout your life (na, na)
If you wanna get fucking high, come closer

Pullin' up in your blacked out Benz
Tryna roll with the cyber twins
You think you're so cool, not tryna be rude to ya
If you're rollin' 'til 4 AM, maybe we can be best of friends
If you're so cool, what can I do to ya?

You've got to dance for me
You've got to dance for me
So take a shot, rip it off, do it all for me
You've got to dance for me
You've got to dance for me
So take a shot, rip it off (do it all for me)
You've got to dance
You've got to dance
You've got to dance
So take a shot, rip it off, do it all for me

Pourin' that drink on ice (na, na)
Don't worry about that price, I'm payin'
Don't wanna hear 'bout your life (na, na, no no)
Show me if you got that style, don't fake it

Pullin' up in your blacked out Benz
Tryna roll with the cyber twins
You think you're so cool, not tryna be rude to ya

You've got to dance for me

You've got to dance
You've got to dance
You've got to dance
So take a shot, rip it off, do it all for me

I'm pretty sure that you're bad for me
Let me look closer, let me see
Oh, I used to fall for your kind all the time
Get my hands dirty and run out of line
I can be who I wanna be
No matter what the big machine is telling me
Oh, I wanna dance, wanna dance all the night
Get my hands dirty and run out of line

Oh, so let me dance for ya, dance for ya
Let me dance for ya, dance for ya
Let me dance for ya, dance for ya
Dance for me, you've got to dance for me
So take a shot, rip it off, do it all for me

You've got to dance
You've got to dance for me
You've got to dance
You've got to dance for me
You've got to dance
So take a shot, rip it off, do it all for me
You've got to dance for me
You've got to dance for me
You've got to dance
You've got to dance
You've got to dance for me
You've got to dance for me
