That you mention
Tommy Gun is who
You seeing now
Gucci, Louis luggage loaded
We always leaving town
Girl
You what I need
The way you make me feel
I never wanna` leave
My sexy lady knows just
How to make me say
Ohhhhh la la la
She let me say
Ohhhhh la la la
You make say
Girl you make me say…
Out in vegas or we
Out the country
Flying in something that`s really comfy
Love TKO she punches me
Every time we go to lunch ye
Put me in awe
Make my jaw drop
Roaming in that drop top
Rose on ice in the back seat
We gonna` run it all night
Like a track meet
Tomorrow night
We`re in the Hollywood clubs
Because you probably would love
Dancing and drinking
The way you looking at me
The way I`m looking at you
We both know just what we thinking!
Yeah (repeat)
I can`t say to much!
Visions of your body
Pressing up close on mine
What you`re doing now
I can`t believe that you`re doing it
Just how I like!
{You`re driving me crazy!
Oh la la la la
You got me crazy now!
Oh la la la la} x 2
Oh la la la la (repeat)
{You make me say…
Oh la la la la…
Girl you make me say…
Oh la la la la} x 2
