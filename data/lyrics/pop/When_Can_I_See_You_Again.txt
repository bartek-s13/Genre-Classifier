(When can we do this again?
When can I see you again?
When can we do this again?
When can I see you again?
When can we do this again?
When can I see you again, gain, gain, gain?)

Switch on the sky and the stars glow for you
Go see the world 'cause it’s all so brand new
Don’t close your eyes 'cause your future’s ready to shine
It’s just a matter of time before we learn how to fly
Welcome to the rhythm of the night
There’s something in the air you can’t deny (Deny)

It's been fun but now I've got to go
Life is way too short to take it slow
But before I go and hit the road
I got to know, 'til then, when can we do this again?

Oh oh, oh oh
When can I see you again?
Oh oh, oh oh
When can we do this again?
Woah oh, oh oh
I got to know (got to know), when can I see you again? (See you again)
(When can I see you again?)
Joined at the hip, yeah, your sidekick needs you
Life is a trip down the road that leads you
Look all around at the mountains you haven't climbed
It's just a matter of time before we learn how to fly
Welcome to the rhythm of the night
There's something in the air you can't deny (Deny)

It's been fun but now I've got to go
Life is way too short to take it slow
But before I go and hit the road (You know!)
I got to know, 'til then, when can we do this again?

Oh oh, oh oh
When can I see you again?
Oh oh, oh oh
When can we do this again?
Oh oh, oh oh
I got to know (got to know), when can I see you again? (See you again)

Don't close your eyes 'cause your future's ready to shine
It's just a matter of time before we learn how to fly
Welcome to the rhythm of the night
There's something in the air you can't deny
So let me know before I wave goodbye
When can I see you again?
Oh oh, oh oh
When can we do this again?
Oh oh, oh oh
When can I see you again?
Oh oh, oh oh
When can we do this again?
Oh oh, oh oh

Yeah it's been fun but now I've got to go
Life is way too short to take it slow
B-b-before I go and hit the road
Tell me when
When can I see you again?
When can I see you again?
