Evil little people made of sand
Live in a beach and they blend in
If you don't see them just pretend
Evil little people made of sand
Live in a beach and they blend in
If you don't see them just pretend

Bathing suit wrapped around my waist
With a Capri Sun in my hand
I don't know what you've got planned
I jump into the hotel pool
And your head popped out the water
Can we stay a little longer? (Mom, can we live here?)

Evil little people made of sand
Live in a beach and they blend in
If you don't see them just pretend
Evil little people made of sand
Live in a beach and they blend in
If you don't see them just pretend
