Charlie's from Sally
Well if you're worried
Why don't you call her up?
You got her number in that little book of yours
(Nothing, nothing, nothing)
It's just about 8 o'clock in San Fransisco

But your voice
In my head

But I've been chasing stars
Ooh, just to feel you there
Yeah
Ooh, just to feel you there

Your voice in my head
It takes me over
Like nothing I've felt before
And it's a feeling of something brand new
But I've been chasing stars
Just to feel
But I've been chasing stars
Ooh, just to feel you there
Yeah (Nothing, nothing, nothing)
Ooh, just to feel you there
Yeah (Nothing, nothing, nothing)

Time froze on loop
When I'm with you
Freezing frames is something that I'm used to
Oh, just draw me a picture
Of what you like to do

But uh
But on loop
Nothing, nothing, nothing
I've felt before

I've been chasing stars
I've been chasing stars
I've been chasing stars
I've been chasing stars (before)
Your voice in my head
It takes me over
Like nothing I've felt before
And it's a feeling of something brand new
But I've been chasing stars
Ooh, just to feel you

I've been chasing stars
Ooh, just to feel you
I've been chasing stars
Just to feel you
Ooh, just to feel you
Nothing, nothing, nothing
I've felt before
I've been chasing stars
Just to feel you
