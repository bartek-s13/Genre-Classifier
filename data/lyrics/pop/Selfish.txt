Is it only in my dreams?
Is it only in my head?
Are you lonely
When you're lying in my bed?
Is it only for tonight?
Gonna leave me disappointed
Only
To take it all away

Close my eyes
And I-I
Keep my distance
I-I
Can't let go, I
I-I
Know you're not mine, but I

I know that I'm being selfish
And I know that you want me too
Can't help, but to touch your body
And I-I
Can't help that I'm being selfish
When I know that you want me too
Can't help, but to want you on me
And I-I
Can't help that I'm so selfish (so selfish)
Can't help that I'm so selfish (so selfish)

Is it just another lie?
Am I just another high?
Are you lonely
When you're holding him at night?
When you run away from home
Am I the one you go to
Only
Until the night is gone?

Close my eyes
And I-I
Keep my distance
I-I
Can't let go, I
I-I
Know you're not mine, but I

I know that I'm being selfish
And I know that you want me too
Can't help, but to touch your body
And I-I
Can't help that I'm being selfish
When I know that you want me too
Can't help, but to want you on me
And I-I
Can't help that I'm so selfish (so selfish)
Can't help that I'm so selfish (so selfish)
Can't help that I'm so selfish (so selfish)
Can't help that I'm so selfish (so selfish)

Close my eyes
And I-I
Keep my distance
I-I
Can't let go, I
I-I
Know you're not mine, but I

I know that I'm being selfish
And I know that you want me too
Can't help, but to touch your body
And I-I
Can't help that I'm being selfish
When I know that you want me too
Can't help, but to want you on me
And I-I
Can't help that I'm so selfish (so selfish)
Can't help that I'm so selfish (so selfish)
Can't help that I'm so selfish (so selfish)
Can't help that I'm so selfish (so selfish)
