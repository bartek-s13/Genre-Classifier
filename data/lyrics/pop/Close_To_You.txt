There’s a gentleness I’ve known
Knew it best when it was fading
Trying to find my way back home
Don’t you know, there’s no escaping

Because I wanted to be loved
I just wanted to get close to you
Because I wanted to be loved
I lost everything I knew


Turned away from all my dreams
Broken down disintegrating
Ignored the signs of all deceit
Couldn’t believe, can you blame me?

Because I wanted to be loved
I just wanted to get close to you
Because I wanted to be loved
I lost everything I knew


Didn’t see until it all was done
Felt so right to hold someone
What I saw in you was almost true
Brutal what the heart will do

Because I wanted to be loved
I just wanted to get close to you
Because I wanted to be loved
I lost everything I knew


Because I wanted to be loved
I just wanted to get close to you
Because I wanted to be loved
I lost everything I knew
