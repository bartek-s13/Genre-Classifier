Well, I've been watching, while you've been coughing
I've been drinking life, while you've been nauseous
And so I drink to health, while you kill yourself
And I've got just one thing that I can offer

Go on and save yourself
And take it out on me
Go on and save yourself
And take it out on me, yeah

I'm not a martyr, I'm not a prophet
And I won't preach to you, but here's a caution
You better understand, that I won't hold your hand
But if it helps you mend, then I won't stop it

Go on and save yourself
And take it out on me
Go on and save yourself
And take it out on me, yeah

Go on and save yourself
And take it out on me
Go on and save yourself
And take it out on me, yeah

Drown if you want, and I'll see you at the bottom
Where you'll crawl on my skin and put the blame on me
So you don't feel a thing

Go on and save yourself
And take it out on me
Go on and save yourself
And take it out on me, yeah

Go on and save yourself
And take it out on me
Go on and save yourself
