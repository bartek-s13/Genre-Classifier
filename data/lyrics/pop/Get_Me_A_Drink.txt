Joys of calling to a serial number
Don't ring us
Yeah
Don't ring us
Thanks for the bright lights

I've thrown up everywhere yeah
It's better than paying my taxes
My mind isn't here yeah
But I'm found a chair I can relax in
(for the bright lights)
I'm not gonna check, yeah, any of my unread emails
I'm a wasted female, wasted female, wasted female

My ex just walked in through the front door
I really don't wanna care anymore (for the bright lights)
What the fuck did he bring that girl for?

I really don't wanna care anymore
Care anymore
Care anymore
Care anymore
Care anymore
Care anymore, (for the bright light)
Care anymore
Care anymore
I only care about one thing
Yeah, will someone get me a drink?
Will somebody get me a drink?
Will somebody, somebody
Will somebody get me a drink?
Will somebody, somebody
Will somebody get me a

Yeah, (thanks for the bright light)
Stumbling, see ya fronting in the club again
Feeling like falling in love again
Never can get enough of this buzz
I'm barely functioning
Tryna find me another drink
Doubled what my consumption is
Shots of vodka and family love
Ain't nobody really telling me to try to be the best
Throw the weed inside of me
We to climb the stress
And I dreamed before I turn to see my ex
Kissing chicks with all the people I resent
I can see you trying to be the girl you not
Getting wasted just to put your mind at rest
Tell em order me another 40 shots
In the morning send it (?)
Don't wanna care anymore
Care anymore
Care anymore

Ay can somebody get me a drink?
Will somebody get me a drink?
Will somebody, somebody
Will somebody get me a drink?

Don't wanna know, don't wanna figure it out
Don't wanna go, I wanna home now
Don't wanna know, don't wanna figure it out
Just wanna go, I just wanna go home

Care anymore
Care anymore
Care anymore
Care anymore (I just wanna go home)
Care anymore
Care anymore
Care anymore
Care anymore (I just wanna go home)
Care anymore
Care anymore
Care anymore
Care anymore
