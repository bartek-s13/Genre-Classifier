Every little part of you won't hurt nobody
Loving what we're not meant to
Can't hurt nobody
Everything we used to do, can it hurt somebody?
Never really wanted to
Every little part of you

It hurts to love you like I do

Give me all of you, in the night I'm looking for a heart to be with my body
Everything you need at the right time
Looking for love regardless, you're leaving
Give me all of you, in the night I'm looking for a heart to be with my body
Everything you need at the right time looking for love regardless

Every little part of me won't hurt no more
Everything you want to be, we've been here before
Was it just a way to leave?
Oh, loving every little part of you
Every little part of me

Nobody knows me like you do

Give me all of you, in the night I'm looking for a heart to be with my body
Everything you need at the right time
Looking for love regardless, you're leaving
Give me all of you, in the night I'm looking for a heart to be with my body
Everything you need at the right time looking for love regardless, regardless

Give me all of you, in the night I'm looking for a heart to be with my body
Everything you need at the right time
Looking for love regardless, you're leaving
Give me all of you, in the night I'm looking for a heart to be with my body
Everything you need at the right time looking for love regardless, you're leaving

Give me all of you, in the night I'm looking for a heart to be with my body
Everything you need at the right time
Looking for love regardless, you're leaving
Give me all of you, in the night I'm looking for a heart to be with my body
Everything you need at the right time looking for love regardless, regardless
