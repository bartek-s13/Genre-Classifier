<<<<<<< HEAD
I devoted my emotion
How you turn to my opponent
I stay focus just to show I prestige (hope you notice)
Eventually you’ll end up dead to me (my condolence)
Plus I wrote this just to blow off some steam (you dead bogus)
Understand that you’ve been broken
Understand I’m not heroic
What you need say the word to me (put in motion)
Girl your love came off so differently (no emotion)
Why your vibe show me hostility (It’s real potent)

Gave you more love than your damn family but don’t be stunned
Heard you thinking ‘bout kamikaze and you got a son
And that’s really selfish plus he one of one

Coulda sworn I taught you better, destroying your own endeavors
You think you special , you don’t decide
You not the vessel, you picking sides
You learning lessons, thru all the permanent consequences
When you start letting niggas cause interference
Tough love hit right thru your defenses
Plus that nigga won’t turn you to no MRS
Wish you the best, listen to HNDRXX, further your limits
Remain imprisoned, I won’t judge how you living
Still your decisions, I won’t judge how you living
Head on collision, ready for war, built like a villain

I told her if she gone ride me, ride me like a Telsa
And do your very best to make you better
Ya best friend tripping she don’t not play as Cinderella
Im in beast mode, tell that bitch don’t overload
This no Oracle you don’t get a revival
Stick to the guy code, guess I’ll stick to my side hoe
You may never live living with false evidence
