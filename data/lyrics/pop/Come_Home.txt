We never said what was on our minds
I know I was the one to mess it up
A couple hundred times
Too proud to admit to my mistakes
But losing you is the biggest one that I've made
But can I win you back? (Win you back?)
Can you let me back in so I can show you?
That I can change and be who you need
Just give me a chance

Oh won't you come home to me?
Baby I don't feel the same
It's you I need
Never should have let you go oh
Come home to me
Come home
Oh

I know I left you broken
Too caught up in the moment
You put your trust in me
When all I ever was just let you down
But I see it now, I can see all my mistakes
Can we go back to the night with that look on your face
When we were both happy
'Cause now we're so distant
If only I knew then what I knew now
This wouldn't be as it is now
Can we just go back?
Babe I'm begging
Oh won't you come home to me?
Baby I don't feel the same
It's you I need
Never should have let you go oh
Come home to me
Come home

Oh won't you come home to me?
Baby I don't feel the same
It's you I need
Never should have let you go oh
Come home to me
Come home
Oh

I just need your love tonight
I just need your love tonight
I just need your love tonight
I just need your love tonight

Oh won't you come home to me?
Baby I don't feel the same
It's you I need
Never should have let you go oh
Come home to me
Come home (Come to come)
Oh (Just come home to me babe)
Oh won't you come home to me?
Baby I don't feel the same
It's you I need
Never should have let you go oh
Come home to me
Come home
