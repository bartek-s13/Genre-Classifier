Ah!
(A G E N D A-A-A)

Am I not pretty enough for ya?
Do I not have the narrative?
You need to like my aesthetic
Am I not cute enough to remember?
I’ve adjusted my perspective
Don’t wanna be part of your clique

But somethings got me caught up
I won’t be made a fool of
Won't be the poster girl that you want

So what are you after?
Don’t you like my colours?
I’m confident, I know it scares ya (scares ya)
Bye-bye, good riddance
The rules have been rewritten
I'm better without you, and that's the truth
I'm not part of your agenda

(Ah, ah!)

Am I not dainty enough for ya? (for ya?)
Do I not wear that pretty dress?
Do I not fake it like the rest
Am I not finding strength in numbers? (numbers)
'Cause you know I'm fine here on my own
Don’t need to make your love my home

When you say that I'm annoying
Well, it's not me you're destroying
'Cause I know who I am, and I'm better than that
'Cause you've got bad taste in people
For not one that I'm grateful
You’re just shooting blanks and you can take that to the bank
*CHING*
