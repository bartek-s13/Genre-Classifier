Stay away from my baby
Even though her love may stray
I never thought she'd mean this much
There's a difference between this lover and lust
Stay away from my lady
When she’s gone days are so hazy
If she left I'd be oh-so lost
I'll keep her here whatever the cost
It's not like I’m a greedy boy at all
It's the flowers in your hair, the way she gives her stare
Stay away from my baby, even though her love may change
I'll keep you here my dear, sweetheart
Never leave, please don't depart
Stay away from my lady
I could never leave such a lady
Keep you here, my dear sweetheart
