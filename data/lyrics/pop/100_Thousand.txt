I heard you kissed that girl
The one you said I didn't have to worry about
Funny, it's the ones you always worry about
And when you were with that girl
Was it everything that you've been dreaming about?
Did you think of me when you were kissing her mouth?

I've been looking up if I can die from heartbreak
But now I've cried enough
I remember mama said

There's 100 thousand people who are perfect for me
And I've been thinking there are plenty fish in the sea
I'm done with wasting time on what I thought we would be
'Cause there's 100 thousand people that are waiting for me
I could burn your things but that's just way too easy
So I'ma tell your mama that you cheated on me
You won't be invited to my birthday party
'Cause there's 100 thousand people that are better for me
And now that I've calmed down
I'm seeing things I didn't when I looked in your eyes
But when we were together we were Bonnie and Clyde
Oh, it's not my problem now
I don't even care what you are doing with her
I don't even think about you doing her
No no

I was looking up if I would die from heartbreak
But things are looking up
I remember mama said

There's 100 thousand people who are perfect for me
And I've been thinking there are plenty fish in the sea
I'm done with wasting time on what I thought we would be
Cause there's 100 thousand people that are waiting for me
I could burn your things but that's just way too easy
So I'ma tell your mama that you cheated on me
You won't be invited to my birthday party
'Cause there's 100 thousand people that are better for me
