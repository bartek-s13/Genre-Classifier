It's lonely but it's safe, in here
And I can always live in fear
Fear of you
We could, we'll always be
With no work, and no tries
Life in, "What if?"
What if I say how I feel?
I think I'm gonna tell
You make me want to share all my feelings
But not enough of me is worth enough to love
Maybe that's why I'm so guarded
I don't know what makes me special (oh)
You don't have to know
I'm used to being by myself
And lately I've felt overwhelmed
By you, you
