Mamma told me to be happy
Cause you always get what you want
Don't speak, you said I have your love
And how much it will cost
Mamma told me, when I was a baby
I'd love you but I don't
Don't speak, I hope you're happy
Cause I think I paid what you want

And by the time I go
Your love had been sold
To everyone else but me
And maybe when I'm old
I'm speaking lingo
You will be willing to see
That we should be
Trying to colour in the sun
But its too dark
And I'm being holy
Is there a stone cause you said, it's your part

How much does your love cost?
How much does your love cost?
How much does your love cost?
How much does your love cost?

I'm not a soldier
Not a fighter
But I will stand my ground
And now I'm older
I'm not your daughter
You don't deserve my love now

And by the time I go
Your love had been sold
To everyone else but me
And maybe when I'm old
I'm speaking lingo
You will be willing to see
That we should be
Trying to colour in the sun
But its too dark
And I'm being holy
Is there a stone cause you said, it's your part

How much does your love cost?
How much does your love cost?
How much does your love cost?
How much does your love cost?

And I'm the best thing you've ever had
But you're too busy burning fires
And I'm the best thing you've ever had
But you're too busy burning fires
And I'm the best thing you've ever had
But you're too busy burning fires
And I'm the best thing you've ever had
But you're too busy burning fires
Oh

How much does your love cost?
How much does your love cost?
How much does your love cost?
How much does your love cost?
How much does your love cost?
How much does your love cost?
How much does your love cost?
How much does your love cost?
