It's ironic, isn't it?
I never seemed to care when I had you there
Oh, but now that you're with her, I'm jealous
It's troubling, isn't it?
How the tables turn 'cause of this one girl
That you replaced me with

It's funny how suddenly you like to share
Every detail of your new love affair
It's just so damn obvious you want me to care

But it's none of my business
I don't know why I'm watchin' you
Play the silent witness
Checkin' up on all that you do
It's not like I still love you, I know I was right
You'd been on my mind if you were out of sight
So I shouldn't play witness
'Cause it's none of my business

It's confusin', isn't it?
You had a broken heart, I heard you fell apart
But you didn't waste no time to get back up
Ooh, I'm surprised that you moved on quickly
But I know deep down that you still love me
Let's see how this unfolds
It's funny how suddenly you like to share (Oh)
Every detail of your new love affair (Oh)
It's just so damn obvious you want me to care

But it's none of my business
I don't know why I'm watchin' you
Play the silent witness
Checkin' up on all that you do
It's not like I still love you, I know I was right
You'd been on my mind if you were out of sight
So I shouldn't play witness
'Cause it's none of my business

No, it's none of my, none of my, none of my business
Oh, no-no, no-no, no-no
So I shouldn't play witness, no
'Cause it's none of my business

But it's none of my business
I don't know why I'm watchin' you
Play the silent witness
Checkin' up on all that you do
It's not like I still love you, I know I was right
You'd been on my mind if you were out of sight
So I shouldn't play witness
