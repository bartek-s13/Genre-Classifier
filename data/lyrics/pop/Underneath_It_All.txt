If I have a son, I will make him king
Teach him how to fight, teach him how to sing
And that a good woman will show you who you are
Not with her words, but with her heart

And underneath it all
I love you
Underneath it all
I love you

If I have a daughter, I will name her queen
Teach her how to fight, teach her how to dream
And too much satisfaction can be like hell
If you want to start a revolution, start with yourself

And underneath it all
I love you
Underneath it all
I love you

It's okay to smile, it's okay to cry
Know your daddy's songs, they will never die
And don't you feel guilty for what you've won
There is good and evil in each and everyone
And underneath it all
I love you
Underneath it all
I love you
Underneath it all
I love you
Underneath it all
I love you
Underneath it all
I love you
Underneath it all
I love you
