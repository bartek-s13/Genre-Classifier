Hang up the phone again, I am not home again
Crossing these fingers that I can keep up with this
Drink in my hand and my mind is on us and my heart is on the floor
No point delaying inevitable conversation
Take me away

How do we make it, when all we can be is apart?
How do we do it, do we fight it to know where we are?
I don't wanna say we didn't try for everything that's in our hearts
How do we do it, oh, how do we make it?
Oh no no no no

Too many nights without warmth in my arms again
Closing my eyes without feeling you closing in
Oh, heart on my sleeve and my mind is on you and the way we're gon' be
No one can save us, no one can save us but me
Take me away

How do we make it, when all we can be is apart?
How do we do it, do we fight it to know where we are?
I don't wanna say we didn't try for everything that's in our hearts
How do we do it, oh, how do we make it?
Oh no no no no
How do we make it, when all we can be is apart?
How do we do it, Do we fight it to know where we are?
Oh, take me away
Take me away

How do we make it, when all we can be is apart?
How do we do it, do we fight it to know where we are?
I don't wanna say we didn't try for everything that's in our hearts
How do we do it, oh, how do we make it?
(oh no no no no)
How do we make it, when all we can be is apart?
How do we do it, do we fight it to know where we are?
I don't wanna say we didn't try for everything that's in our hearts
How do we do it, oh, how do we make it?
