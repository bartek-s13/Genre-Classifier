We knew each other when we were very young
High school sweethearts, or something American
Now we've become older I only see photos
She's what I thought, something American
Something American

But you don't call me now
And I don't think too much about you
But when she's not around
I can feel you're lonely
Oh, I can feel you're lonely somehow

I'm not nice like her
Won't wear white like her
Don't live life with the pages mapped out
No, I'm not perfect
But then no one is
We're all reaching for something American

But you don't call me now
And I don't think too much about you
But when she's not around
I can feel you're lonely

I can feel you all night
In my dreams I find
The stars align and they all collide
And it's you and I
Oh, back in time, it feels so right

But you don't call me now
And I don't think too much about you
But when she's not around
I can feel you're lonely, oh
You don't call me now
And I don't think too much about you
But when she's not around
I can feel you're lonely, oh
I can feel you're lonely somehow

We knew each other when we were very young
High school sweethearts, or something American
