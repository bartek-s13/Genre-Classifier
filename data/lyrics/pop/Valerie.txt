Well sometimes, I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things (What you're doing)
And in my head I paint a picture

Since I've come home
Well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over?
Stop makin' a fool, out of me
Why don't you come on over Valerie..
Valerie, Valerie, Valerie...

Did you have to go to jail?
Put your house on up for sale
Did you get a good lawyer?
Hope you didn't catch a tan
Hope you'll find the right man
Who'll fix it for ya'

Are you shopping anywhere?
Change the color of your hair
And are you busy?
Did you have to pay that fine
You were dodging all the time
Are you still busy?
Since I've come home
Well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over?
Stop makin' a fool, out of me
Why don't you come on over Valerie..
Valerie, Valerie, Valerie...

Valerie, Valerie, Valerie...
Valerie, Valerie, Valerie, Oh oh
Valerie..Why don't you come on over Valerie..
