Hey, where did you go?
Spending summer in a ghost town
You and me both
Singing Champagne Supernova
Our belongings in a car
Stole your daddy's Jaguar
Didn't know where we belong
But we were way too young
To be crying in the sun

The ocean couldn't take us away, take us away
Didn't need nobody else
I wanted you to crash into me, crash into me
Remember how it felt
When the night turned into day
Always on the run
Moonshine and some nicotine
And we were way too young
To be crying in the sun
To be crying in the sun

Where did those days go?
High on your love by the beach
You were my drug, oh
We would make out in the streets
And you drove me in a shopping cart
Felt like we we're a piece of art
Didn't know where we belong
But we were way too young
To be crying in the sun

The ocean couldn't take us away, take us away
Didn't need nobody else
I wanted you to crash into me, crash into me
Remember how it felt
When the night turned into day
Always on the run
Moonshine and some nicotine
And we were way too young
To be crying in the sun
To be crying in the sun

Didn't know where we belong
But we were way too young
To be crying in the sun

The ocean couldn't take us away, take us away
Didn't need nobody else
I wanted you to crash into me, crash into me
Remember how it felt
When the night turned into day
Always on the run
Moonshine and some nicotine
And we were way too young
To be crying in the sun
To be crying in the sun
To be crying in the sun
