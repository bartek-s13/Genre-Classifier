There is something you should know
Something that will steal your stars
Stop now, seat down
It will be too loud
And you can try to escape
Cause now
I can tell you
Now you are mine
Like a bullet in my mind
There is nothing you could show
Nothing that will kill your fears
Stand now, come down
You won't be too proud
And you can't try to escape
Cause now
I can tell you
