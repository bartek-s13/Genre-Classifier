Boy I don't need anybody else but you
I'm caught up in every little thing you do
I'm always scared of getting close
But I can never overdose on you
I don't want anybody else, it's true

Maybe it's all in my head
Maybe it's something you said
That got me feeling this way
I need you 20 times a day
What did you expect
If you gonna kiss me like that
I want you biting my lips
Got my name hanging from your necklace, oh

Every time you whisper my name
You give me that pleasure pain

Boy, I don't need anybody else but you
I'm caught up in every little thing you do
I'm always scared of getting close
But I can never overdose on you
I don't want anybody else, it's true
Wha-wha-wha-whi-whisper my name
Wha-wha-wha-whi-whisper my name
Every time you whisper my name
Boy, I don't want anybody else, it's true

I wasn't ready for the fall
I wasn't looking for commitment
But baby I'm not scared at all
Now you're the drug I'm never quittin'
What did you expect
If you gonna touch me like that
'Cause when you love my body slow
You hit that spot in my soprano

Every time you whisper my name
You give me that pleasure pain

Boy, I don't need anybody else but you
I'm caught up in every little thing you do
I'm always scared of getting close
But I can never overdose on you
I don't want anybody else, it's true
Wha-wha-wha-whi-whisper my name
Wha-wha-wha-whi-whisper my name
Every time you whisper my name
Boy, I don't want anybody else, it's true

Every time you whisper my name
You give me that pleasure pain
I'm always scared of getting close
But I can never overdose on you
I don't want anybody else, it's true

Wha-wha-wha-whi-whisper my name
Wha-wha-wha-whi-whisper my name
Every time you whisper my name
Boy, I don't want anybody else, it's true
