(Ayo)
Power-ups, jetpacks
Watching from above
Deathmatch, game on
Killing for the love
(Ayo)
Moving the map, we scoping the scene
Just me and my team
Nightvision, silent
Ready just me and myself and my beam
(A-ha)
Nota one, nota gun, notta fuck boy
Nah none of y'all can't stop this
Flanking right on your position
Poised we be terrorizing your metropolis
(Ah)
Middle finger to a cop bitch
Bet a trigger fing or two will fucking pop this
Hit you with a mind no conscience
For your nonsence I got con-sence

Sudden change in the moment
I'm not the same
Money, women and fame
And a bottle that's got my name
Stuck in this game, click boom
Bombs falling from above
Running, ducking for cover
I'm praying for ones I love
(Go)

Deathmatch, Game On!

For your non-sence I got con-sence!

Ready just me and myself and my beam!


(Ayo)
Pop up and I will destroy all you newbs
With a style, with a smile like goddamn
Cheatcodes got the diagrams
Putting bullet holes in your diaphram
Respawn, die again
New perk, bitch, I'm Iron Man
Melee beat it up, try again
I'm on fire, headshots, I'm spying them

One shot, last clip from the hip, that's it
RKO, I'm the comeback kid
With a KRD you don't want those hits
I'ma run this gun you dont want that fits like
Middle finger to a cop bitch
Bet a trigger fing or two will fucking pop this
Hit you with a mind no conscience
For your non-sence I got con-sence
Hell no homie
You don't wanna get to know me
I been known to go Bologna when
I meet or beat a muthafucking phoney
(Yo)
Hell no homie
You don't wanna get to know me
I been known to go Bologna when
I meet or beat a muthafucking phoney

Sudden change in the moment
I'm not the same
Money, women and fame
And a bottle that's got my name
Stuck in this game, click boom
Bombs falling from above
Running, ducking for cover
I'm praying for ones I love
(Go)

Deathmatch, Game On!

For your non-sence I got con-sence!

Ready just me and myself and my beam!

I'm praying for ones I love
