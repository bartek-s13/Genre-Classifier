Well I take my glasses off when I see a beautiful thing
I see it better, see it better, see it better
Just because I'm different skin
Do you think I matter?
Do you think, do you think at all?
Do you feel angry if I do something or say something?
I wonder which ones which
Don't tell me about my body
Don't tell me about my body
When you see it twitch
When you see it twitch
We're just a matter of matter
But I know you’re something else
I love the way things have a double life
We're just a matter of matter
But I know you’re something else
I love the way things have a double life
But if you look hard enough you will never find it
Because the seabirds, they're in my body
Because the seabirds, they're in my head
I wish the seabirds were all around me
I wish the seabirds would leave me dead
Seabirds, seabirds
There's this stream right under this bridge
And I go everyday everyday
The water is thin just like your skin
And it's cold and it's cold and it's pale
We run for meters on bathroom tiles
And we've walked on solid ground
Well I like your body, I like your body
I like the sound, like the sound, like the sound
Like the sound, like the sound, like the sound
Like the sound, like the sound, like the sound
We're just a matter of matter
But I know you’re something else
I love the way things have a double life
We're just a matter of matter
But I know you’re something else
I love the way things have a double life
But if you look hard enough you will never find it
And if you look hard enough you will never try
I wish the seabirds were in my body
I wish the seabirds were in my head
I wish the seabirds were all around me
I wish the seabirds would leave me dead
I wish the seabirds were in my body
I wish the seabirds were in my head
I wish the seabirds were all around me
I wish the seabirds would leave me dead
