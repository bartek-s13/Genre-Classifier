Sweet FA
I'll take you any day, don't take me out
Just let me hear the growl from those perfect lips
Your sweet caressing kiss can lay me out
Just don't go lead me south

As you seep on in and keep me down
As you seep on in and keep me lying' round

Morning blues
You're such a sweet perfume, just shut your eyes
And don't go leave my side
I'll couch my days, I'm gone in such a blaze of lazy love
And it's turning me to scum

As you seep on in and keep me down
Yeah, you seep on in and keep me lying' round


Yeah, you seep on in and keep me down
Yeah, you seep on in and keep me down
