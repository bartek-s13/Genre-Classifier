It's murder on the dancefloor
But you better not kill the groove, DJ
Gonna burn this goddamn house right down

Oh, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
About your kind
And so and so and so and so and so
I'll have to play

If you think you're getting away
I will prove you wrong
I'll take you all the way
Boy, just come along
Hear me when I say, hey

It's murder on the dancefloor
But you better not kill the groove, hey, hey
It's murder on the dancefloor
But you better not steal the moves, DJ
Gonna burn this goddamn house right down

Oh, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
There maybe others
And so and so and so and so and so and so
You'll just have to pray

If you think you'll get away
I will prove you wrong
I'll take you all the way
Stay another song
I'll blow you all away, hey

It's murder on the dancefloor
But you better not kill the groove, hey, hey
It's murder on the dancefloor
But you better not steal the moves, DJ
Gonna turn this house around somehow
Murder on the dancefloor
But you better not kill the groove, hey, hey
It's murder on the dancefloor
But you better not steal the moves, DJ
Gonna burn this goddamn house right down


Don't think you'll get away
I will prove you wrong
I'll take you all the way
Boy, just come along
Hear me when I say, hey

It's murder on the dancefloor
But you better not kill the groove
It's murder on the dancefloor
But you better not steal the moves, DJ
Gonna burn this goddamn house right down
It's murder on the dancefloor
But you better not kill the groove, hey, hey
It's murder on the dancefloor
But you better not steal the moves, DJ
Gonna burn this goddamn house right down
It's murder on the dancefloor
But you better not kill the groove, hey, hey
It's murder on the dancefloor
