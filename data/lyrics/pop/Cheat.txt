Ha ha, woah
Woah
Woah Woah, Woah

If it'd been me, I would've called your phone
Told you that I was needy, feelin' all alone
One call, hey but maybe that's crazy, that's just me
If it'd been me, I might've held myself
Told ya that I was busy seeing someone else, the truth
Hey but maybe that's crazy, that's just me

I know it's hard to go a day, without it

Don't have to say you're sorry, let's just forget that you're a cheat
Don't have to feel bad for me, I won't be losing sleep
But I would've done much better, you messed it up forever
I know, I'd treat you better
Maybe that's just crazy, that's just me

If it'd been me, I might've stopped to think
Done the right thing after I had a lot to drink
Gone home, hey but maybe that's crazy, that's just me
If it'd been me I would've pictured you, knowing that'd you'd be her, I would've thought it through
It's not hard
Hey but maybe that's crazy, that's just me
You can't help yourself so don't worry about it

Don't have to say you're sorry, let's just forget that you're a cheat
Don't have to feel bad for me, I won't be losing sleep
But I would've done much better, you messed it up forever
I know, I'd treat you better
Maybe that's just crazy, that's just me

Even after all you put me through, wonder why I'm missin' you
Maybe that's crazy, that's just maybe that's crazy, maybe that's crazy, that's just

Don't have to say you're sorry, let's just forget that you're a cheat
Don't have to feel bad for me, I won't be losing sleep
But I would've done much better, you messed it up forever
I know, I'd treat you better
Maybe that's just crazy, that's just me
Don't have to say you're sorry, let's just forget that you're a cheat
Don't have to feel bad for me, I won't be losing sleep
But I would've done much better, you messed it up forever
I know, I'd treat you better
