I don’t know...
If I’m in love with you
Or the idea of loving you
It’s unclear
I mean I used to feel so sure
But I might just be immature
I've been
Stuck on you for so long that
It's hard
To tell myself I may be wrong
About
The way that I feel
For you
For so long
I would squeal
Over a single text from you
You.....
'Cause it’s not love
When you don’t talk anymore
And it’s not love
When I never meant something to you
So why did I
Ever catch
These stupid feelings
I knew
When you told me I was cute
That I was dreaming
So now
I'll try and tell myself
My feelings have no meaning
They have no meaning....
They have no meaning....
'Cause it’s not love
When you don’t talk anymore
And it’s not love
When you make me feel like I'm a bore
And it’s not love
When I was the only one who's waiting
And it’s not love
When there was no chance of you saying
I love you too...
I love you too...
And I don’t know
If I'm in love with you
Or the idea of loving you
It’s unclear
I mean I used to feel so sure
But I might just be immature
I’ve been
So stuck on you for so long
That it's hard
To tell myself I may be wrong
