Lately I've been feeling gray
A little less human
A little less human
A little less human

Lately I've been feeling gray
A little less human
A little less human
A little less human

Thinking about the ways I used to like to be
Maybe some day well create some harmony
Thinkin' 'bout a way to get all that I want
Maybe some day you could be the one
(Lady come on)
