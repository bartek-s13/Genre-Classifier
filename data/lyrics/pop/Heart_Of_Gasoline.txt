My thoughts are running towards you now
A ritual, don't let me drown
Ooh, we've had our shares of ups and downs
The way we used to stay without a sound
Would I'd be lying if I said nothing now?

I can't get you off my clothes our skin
You're underneath
I can't live what you put on me
You left your mark on me
I can't wait no more for me
I'm close to make you see

I've got a heart of gasoline
Won't you light it up for me?
I've got a heart of gasoline
Won't you light it up for me?
I've got a heart of gasoline
Won't you light it up for me?
I've got a heart of gasoline
Won't you light it up for me?
I've got a heart of gasoline
(Won't you light it up for)

I wish I could press rewind, yeah
'Cause now I've got nothing to hide
Ooh, I know it's wrong, but feels so right
Whenever you're around I'm butterflies
Forget the pains just for tonight

I can't get you off my clothes our skin
You're underneath
I can't live what you put on me
You left your mark on me
I can't wait no more for me
I'm close to make you see

I've got a heart of gasoline
Won't you light it up for me?
I've got a heart of gasoline
Won't you light it up for me?
I've got a heart of gasoline
Won't you light it up for me?
I've got a heart of gasoline
Won't you light it up for me?
I've got a heart of gasoline
(Won't you light it up for)

I'm trying so hard to pretend
I don't need you when I need you
I'm trying so hard to pretend, but
I've got a heart of gasoline
Won't you light it up for me?

I've got a heart of gasoline
Won't you light it up for me?
I've got a heart of gasoline
Won't you light it up for me?
I've got a heart of gasoline
Won't you light it up for me?
I've got a heart of gasoline
Won't you light it up for me?
I've got a heart of gasoline
Won't you light it up for
