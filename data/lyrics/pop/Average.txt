All these bitches average
Don't they understand
Romy is a savage
And I'm feelin' like the man

I'm lookin' too nasty you feel like a freak
You feelin' yourself then you feelin' like me
Call on my phone then it's costing a fee
Float like a bat but I sting like a bee
I'm after paper, my Q's and my P's
Know I'm the plug and my dope isn't free
I got a blade and it's sharp as my teeth
Bitches too basic don't add up to me
I do my walk and they stare
I'm blowin' smoke in the air
Running them knives I don't care
Jump in the bitch like it's sand
You couldn't cop this shit rare
You get some change and you flaunt
They do whatever they can
But I do whatever I want

All these bitches average
Don't they understand
Romy is a savage
And I'm feelin' like the man
All you bitches average
Don't you understand
All your shit look tragic
Drawing lines inside the sand

Yeah I do whatever I want
All these bitches average
Don't they understand
Romy is a savage
And I'm feelin' like the man

You can not kill me, I'm dead
I just been stuck in my head
And I got it under the bed
But fuck all that shit that he said
I'm tryna get to my bread
Keepin' my family fed, ay
All of these bitches is weak
And my tunnel vision is red
Depression a monster
I think an impostor has taken my body and finally faced
Realized the  my sanity frontin' through all of the weight of anxiety case
What are my problems I'm hittin' the race
Stackin' my guala, I fiend for the pace
Hop in impala, I fiend for the chase
And my shit is too dope i still fiend for the base, ay
I put it all in a coffin
You know that Romy is poppin'
I never hear what they talkin'
I'm on a roll, never stoppin'
You can not catch me now
I can not see the ground
I'm seein' Jesus now
I been in pieces now
Maybe I'm not okay
Swimming through all the pain
Makin' my problems fade

Headhsots
Just might kill a wack ho
Woke up with agression
I might smoke her like tobacco
I don't trust nobody, only one that got my back tho
I was hearin' voices, they won't make it out the back door
I was loading clips, makin' hits, bitch don't sound like this
Thought you had some shit, what is this? You just average
I was loading clips, makin' hits, bitch don't sound like this
Thought you had some shit, what is this? You just average

Bang, feel that rain drop
Flowin' through my veins
I'm in pain in the same spot, swear I'm not insane
You can't hang, do not name drop, we are not the same
What you claim? Say they swear to God, I swallow the pain
Let it bang, feel the rain drop
Flowin' through my veins
I'm in pain in the same spot, swear I'm not insane
You can't hang, do not name drop, we are not the same
What you claim? Say they swear to God but I swallow the pain, ay
