Easy living
Killed the young dudes in the high boots
Teenage in the pace age
That's when love burns, now it's your turn

Fascination, fascination
It's just the way we feel
Fascination, fascination
It's just the way we feel

We love this exaltation, woh-oh, woh-oh-oh
We want the new temptations, woh-oh, woh-oh-oh
It's like a revelation, woh-oh, woh-oh-oh
We live on fascination

Passion is our passion
In the moonlight on a joyride
Easy living
Killed the young dudes in the high boots (Ah, yeah)

Fascination, fascination
It's just the way we feel (Come on)

We love this exaltation, woh-oh, woh-oh-oh
We want the new temptations, woh-oh, woh-oh-oh
It's like a revelation, woh-oh, woh-oh-oh
We live on fascination

The word is on your lips, say the word
The word is on your lips, say the word
The word is on your lips, say the word
The word is on your lips, say the word
The word is on your lips, say the word
The word is on your lips, say the word
The word is on your lips, say the word
The word is on your lips, say the word
The word is on your lips, say the word
The word is on your lips, say the word
The word is on your lips, say the word
Fas-ci-na-tion

We love this exaltation, woh-oh, woh-oh-oh
We want the new temptations, woh-oh, woh-oh-oh
It's like a revelation, woh-oh, woh-oh-oh
We live on fascination (Ohh)

Say the word now
Say the word
Come on, say the word now
Come on
