(Verse One)
I remember looking at magazines
I never saw anyone quite like me
It was hard, it was hard for me
I would never speak up out of turn
Bout those blonde blue-eyed girls
They were beautiful
But it was hard, hard for me to dream
(Chorus)
I'll be my own homecoming queen
As long as it feels good to me
I'll be the voice of this town
You'll be your own homecoming queen
Forget all the shit that you've seen
Put on the crown
(Verse Two)
When I was a teenager
Awkward body hair, and big derriere
It was harder, so much harder than it seemed
I am a woman now
I feel beautiful, and I love myself
But it was hard, to get used to me
(Chorus)
I'll be my own homecoming queen
As long as it feels good to me
I'll be the voice of this town
You'll be your own homecoming queen
Forget all the shit that you've seen
Put on the crown
(Bridge)
Cause in 1967 I wasn't human
And in 1994 I was born
I'm still here
We are still here
(Chorus)
I'll be my own homecoming queen
As long as it feels good to me
I'll be the voice of this town
You'll be your own homecoming queen
Forget all the shit that you've seen
Put on the crown
Put on that crown
Put on that crown
Put on that crown
Put on that crown
Put on that crown
Put on that crown
Put on that crown
Put on that crown
