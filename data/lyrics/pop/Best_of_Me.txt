Ever since I was 9 I’ve known all the lies
I found out the reason our parents would fight
As you slipped into the night through your window
You’re breathing to life a chemical mind
Was soaking in promise but you set it alight
Now I’m watching it burn through my window
Yeah I’ve been watching it burn but you’ll never know

Yeah you’ll always get the best of, get the best of me
Yeah you’ll always get the best of, get the best of me
Even when you’re 5 mils deep in the restroom like it don’t matter to me
Yeah you’ll always get the, yeah you’ll always get the best of me

When I was 17 you told me straight to my face
I don’t expect your forgiveness but I’ve been thinking straight
I’m gonna fix my mistakes I’ll do whatever it takes
But I can’t even count on my hands how many times that you’ve said
The same old shit then 2 weeks on you’re fucking gone again
So I say I believe you but I know I can’t

Yeah you’ll always get the best of, get the best of me
Yeah you’ll always get the best of, get the best of me
Even when you’re 5 mils deep in the restroom like it don’t matter to me
Yeah you’ll always get the, yeah you’ll always get the best of me
Oh no matter how hard it might seem
When you’re breaking at the seams
Remember how far you’ve come
No I’ll never walk away
Until the pipe concedes your reins
Coz I know where you’re heading for if I do
So you’ll always get the best of, get the best of me
Yeah you’ll always get the best of, get the best of me
Even when you’re 5 mils deep in the restroom like it don’t matter to me
Yeah you’ll always get the, yeah you’ll always get the best of me

Yeah you’ll always get the best of, get the best of me
Yeah you’ll always get the best of, get the best of me
Even when you’re 5 mils deep in the restroom like it don’t matter to me
Yeah you’ll always get the, yeah you’ll always get the best of me
