I can feel your Eros from miles away
We all need a little loving, we're only human babe
And I don't care we don't have to restrain
Cause you know you want it, oh you want it baby

I can sense your energy from worlds away
And I won't touch if you don't feel like you want to play
But don't you front we can do this all day
But you know you want, oh you want it crazy

Show me how you feel
Go slow, it's all just fun
Show me how you feel
Go slow, it's all just fun

I just need your body so many ways
Cause I don't trust that you don't need no loving babe
And I don't care if you wanted to lay
Cause we know we want it, oh we want the same

Show me how you feel
Go slow, it's all just fun
Show me how you feel
Go slow, it's all just fun

Show me how you feel
Go slow, it's all just fun
Show me how you feel
