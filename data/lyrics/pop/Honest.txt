I don’t know why we keep doing what we do
Spend every day getting wasted me and you
But we don’t get the drinks in
No, we don’t get them in
Go back to mine, every night
But we won’t be talking anyway
My clothes get in the way

You got me thinking so badly
Wanna get drunk on your body
I won’t get sick in the morning
You’re my painkiller and I
I can’t stop thinking about you, oh

You got me on fire tonight
Feel a little high tonight
We’re both tipsy, that’s alright
'Cause you know, yeah you know, yeah you know, baby
We don’t need nobody else
You can keep me to yourself
Drink me like I’m good for your health
And I know, and I know, and I know that
You got me on it, on it
I’m just being honest, honest
You got me on it, on it
I’m just being honest, honest

I don’t get hungover when I’m with you
Don’t get the guilt 'cause I know that when we’re through
Won’t regret any texting
Won’t have drunk dialled my ex
It must be love, that’s what they say
If she makes you happy everyday
In a very certain way

You got me thinking so badly
Wanna get drunk on your body
I won’t get sick in the morning
You’re my painkiller and I
I can’t stop thinking about you, oh

You got me on fire tonight
Feel a little high tonight
We’re both tipsy, that’s alright
'Cause you know, yeah you know, yeah you know, baby
We don’t need nobody else
You can keep me to yourself
Drink me like I’m good for your health
And I know, and I know, and I know that
You got me on it, on it
I’m just being honest, honest
You got me on it, on it
I’m just being honest, honest

You got me thinking so badly, ooh, baby
I wanna get drunk on your body
I can’t stop thinking about you, oh

You got me on fire tonight (you got me on fire, baby, yeah)
Feel a little high tonight
We’re both tipsy, that’s alright
'Cause you know, yeah you know, yeah you know, baby (I know)
We don’t need nobody else (nobody else)
You can keep me to yourself (to yourself)
Drink me like I’m good for your health
And I know, and I know, and I know that

You got me on it, on it (you got me honest, yeah, baby)
I’m just being honest, honest
You got me on it, on it (oh, no, no)
I’m just being honest, honest (just be honest)
You got me on it, on it (we don't need nobody else, baby)
I’m just being honest, honest (just be honest)
You got me on it, on it
I’m just being honest, honest
