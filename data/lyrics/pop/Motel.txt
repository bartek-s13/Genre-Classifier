You're weak, broken in a motel
You blink, tears are falling down, down, down
And you're free, free inside your own hell
You speak, "Someone let me out, out, out"

And I can't stop this pain it only grows
Tell me why I always feel alone
And I can't fight this feeling anymore
Show me what I'm really living for

I wanna love, wanna live, wanna breathe, wanna give, wanna
But it's hard and it's dark and we're doomed from the start, gotta
I wanna love, wanna live, wanna breathe, wanna give, wanna
But it's hard and it's dark and I'm falling apart, gotta

Your dreams, slowly turn against you
Your feet, sink into the ground, ground, ground
And you bleed, naked in a black room
You scream, "Someone let me out, out, out"

And I can't stop this pain it only grows
Tell me why I always feel alone
And I can't fight this feeling anymore
Show me what I'm really living for

I wanna love, wanna live, wanna breathe, wanna give, wanna
But it's hard and it's dark and we're doomed from the start, gotta
I wanna love, wanna live, wanna breathe, wanna give, wanna
But it's hard and it's dark and I'm falling apart, gotta

"How come most of your songs are sad songs?"
"Well you know, I don't think they're all that sad. I have a few that aren't sad, they're like hopeless, totally hopeless situation. And the rest aren't sad, they're just the way it goes. I mean, you don't think life's sad? But from recognizing the sadness you can put it aside, be happy and enjoy the happy side of life."

I wanna love, wanna live, wanna breathe, wanna give, wanna
But it's hard and it's dark and we're doomed from the start, gotta
I wanna love, wanna live, wanna breathe, wanna give, wanna
But it's hard and it's dark and we're falling apart, gotta
