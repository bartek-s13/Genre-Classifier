Yo, check it out, I've got a plan, here's my intention
The frat boys in the club are lame, let's start an altercation
It's just what I'm used to, just want to fuck shit up
I got my whole damn crew, come on, what you going to do?

I kissed a boy and they liked it, got all the honies in the club excited
I kissed a boy just to start shit, and homeboy was not about it
I know it's wrong, but I don't mind, I'm going to start shit tonight
I kissed a boy just to start shit, bitches loved it

Nah, you don't even know my name, it doesn't matter
Don't even front, you got no game, you're just a sucker
So what now, I clowned you, and I'm stealing your girl too
She wants a secure dude, and that's just not you

I kissed a boy and they liked it, got all the honies in the club excited
I kissed a boy just to start shit, and homeboy was not about it
I know it's wrong, but I don't mind, I'm going to start shit tonight
I kissed a boy just to start shit, bitches loved it

Me and my bros that's how we roll
You'll never know how far we'll go
I'll grab some chump that I don't know
And plant one right on him
You're only here for our amusement
I kissed a boy and they liked it, got all the honies in the club excited

I know it's wrong, but I don't mind, I'm going to start shit tonight

Welcome to the new administration!
