Oh yeah!
All right!

Well, I don't show off; don't criticize
I'm just livin' by my own feelings
And I won't give in, won't compromise
'Cause I only have a steadfast heart of gold

I don't know why I can leave though it might be tough
But I ain't out of control, just livin' by my word
Don't ask me why; I don't need a reason
I got my way, my own way!

It doesn't matter now what happens
I will never give up the fight!
Long as the voice inside drives me to run and fight
It doesn't matter who is wrong and who is right


Well I don't look back; I don't need to
Time won't wait and I've got so much to do

Where do I stop now; it's all a blur and so unclear
Well, I don't know, but I can't be wrong!

It doesn't matter now what happens
I will never give up the fight!
Long as the voice inside drives me to run and fight
Place all your bets on the one you think is right


Oh, it doesn't matter now what happens
I will never give up the fight!
Long as the voice inside drives me to run and fight
It doesn't matter who is wrong and who is right

No, no, no, no
It Doesn't Matter!
