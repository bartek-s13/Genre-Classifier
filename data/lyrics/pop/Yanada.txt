<<<<<<< HEAD
People say it's not cool to be sweet like you
They wanna wreck it in the moment, keep you cynical
Well, that's not me, sister, that's not my style
With you, I'm walking to the water and I take a dive

And I'm high there, walking with you again
Tell me how it was in the beginning of our land
We're like the Dreamtime, shedding our skin again

I open up my eyes underwater
I just open up my eyes underwater (Ooh)
I open up my eyes underwater
I just open up my eyes under, uh, under the water

And I'm looking at you, you just think too much
You gotta get out of your head, baby, get back in touch
Well, there's a secret in the river and the river is deep
I know if I dream the future, it will dream back at me

And I'm high there, walking with you again
Tell me how it was in the beginning of our land
We're like the Dreamtime, shedding our skin again
I open up my eyes underwater
I just open up my eyes underwater (Ooh)
I open up my eyes underwater
I just open up my eyes under, uh, under the water

Yanada yanada yanada-marri yanada
Gumada, gumada, nula burra-wa
Yanada yanada yanada, walama yanama-la
Gumada, gumada wa nura (Ngurra-wa)
Yanada yanada yanada-marri yanada
Gumada, gumada, nula burra-wa
Yanada yanada yanada, walama yanama-la
Wa nura wa nura (Ngurra-wa)

And you got nothing to prove standing up on your feet
Even though people like to see you living down on your knees
To the big sister, little sister, take me into your arms
Well, there's a secret in the river and the river is deep
You don't need to fear the future if you see what I see

And I'm high there, walking with you again
Tell me how it was in the beginning of our land
We're like the Dreamtime, shedding our skin again
I open up my eyes underwater
I just open up my eyes underwater (Ooh)
I open up my eyes underwater
I just open up my eyes under, uh, under the water

Hold yourself in it, brace yourself with it
Oh, hold yourself in it, brace yourself with it
Hold yourself in it, brace yourself with it
Sweet water, get in it and brace yourself with it, singing

Yanada yanada yanada-marri yanada
Gumada, gumada, nula burra-wa
Yanada yanada yanada, walama yanama-la
Gumada, gumada wa nura (Ngurra-wa)
Yanada yanada yanada-marri yanada
Gumada, gumada, nula burra-wa
Yanada yanada yanada, walama yanama-la
Wa nura wa nura (Ngurra-wa)
Yanada yanada yanada-marri yanada
Gumada, gumada, nula burra-wa (Sweet water)
Yanada yanada yanada, walama yanama-la
Gumada, gumada wa nura (Ngurra-wa)
Yanada yanada yanada-marri yanada
Gumada, gumada, nula burra-wa
Yanada yanada yanada, walama yanama-la
(Sweet water, get in it, brace yourself with it, singing)
