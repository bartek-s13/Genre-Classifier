We can fight our desires
But when we start making fires
We get ever so hot
Whether we like it or not
They say we can love who we trust
But what is love without lust
Two hearts with accurate devotions
And what are feelings without emotions?

I知 going in for the kill
I知 doing it for a thrill
Oh I知 hoping you値l understand
And not let go of my hand

I知 going in and I知a go hard
I mean what's the point if it ain't no scars
A little teeth marks
Blood on the collar
That's real love, mmhmm ahhnah
She said uh
How could you love someone that hurt you, played you, spoke to provoke you
How could you love someone that burns you, turns you into a werewolf
And in the moment you might do some things you池e not aware of
No one痴 prepared for the scale of this, and now you fear love
And war and war and more and more drama looking for a score
State you池e looking for a tour
Her allure is more couture, tailor-made
'Til your screams in rage
I mean ahhhhh I'm breaking out the damn cage, aghh
Hannibal Lector, my A-merican Psycho
A iller version of Ike, yo
The Thriller version of Michael
My recital is as bright as the light show up at the Eiffel
A werewolf up in Paris, I'm livin' off your vitals
I mean, I値l be your con man, I値l be your damn liar
Let's start the interview, I値l be your vampire
I gotta feel you, bite your neck to get familiar
And if you die, guess what, I fuckin' killed you

I知 going in for the kill
I知 doing it for a thrill
Oh I知 hoping you値l understand
And not let go of my hand

Let痴 go to war
To make peace
Let痴 be cold
To create heat
I hope in darkness
We can see
And you池e not blinded by the light from me

I知 going in for the kill
I知 doing it for a thrill
Oh I知 hoping you値l understand
