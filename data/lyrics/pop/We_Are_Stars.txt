Everything's so small
When you're on top of the world
It's hard to understand
What's still yet to unfold
Pretending to be who you're not
Is a waste of what you've got
Keep dreaming, keep dreaming, keep dreaming
Keep on, keep believing

We are the kings and queens of hearts that break
We may fall in between the cracks
Living life like it's just a game of blackjack
I don't know how but we always find our way back
Looking back when I was just a little girl
With a big dream living in a lonely world
It seems life is impossible
So believe that you're unstoppable, hey

We are stars and
We are open-hearted
We are lovers
We are into loving
We are stars and
We are open-hearted
We are lovers
We are built for loving

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-whoa-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-whoa-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-whoa-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-whoa-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-whoa-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-whoa-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-whoa-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-whoa-oh-oh

It's hard to see the light
When you're caught up in your life
You're scared and insecure
'Cause now it's fight or flight
Can't think of giving up
You don't know how much you're loved
Keep dreaming, keep dreaming, keep dreaming
Keep on, keep believing

We are the kings and queens of hearts that break
We may fall in between the cracks
Living life like it's just a game of blackjack
I don't know how but we always find our way back
Looking back when I was just a little girl with a big dream living in a lonely world
It seems life is impossible so believe that you're unstoppable
