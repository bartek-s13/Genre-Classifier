Headed west now from the blighted plain
It's kind of gorgeous in a Georgic way
Staring outside, watching every change
I think it's just a type of way to explain how I miss you

How I hope you're fine
That I've been sad
Tracing Lichtenstein
With my eyes closed
On the phone at night
Always bummed out
'Cause the world's not right
At this time

At the drive-thru with the headlights on
And now I'm feeling like I'm Roquentin
In a streetcar
Near Corrine Marchand
I'll go Michel Legrand and set it to song

How I miss you
How I hope you're fine
That I've been sad
Tracing Lichtenstein
With my eyes closed
On the phone at night
Always bummed out
Back in New York in the August sun
Wandering Greenpoint while the L still runs
And I run back to a different day
In the meantime, you can dance, you can hit replay
