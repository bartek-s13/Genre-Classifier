Verse 1:
Hit by the moment
Hit by the moment ary loneliness
Maybe you noticed
I never really knew what I should've said
Now that I've spoken
It's something you can't amend
Chorus:
If we start to break
There'll be nothing left to hold together
But if we dislocate
Maybe I would say it better
Even with a parachute
Still, it's just the way I'm falling
If we dislocate
Verse 2:
There was a moment
It fell into place, oh we were hypnotized
There was a place where
Where we were born again
Chorus:
If we start to break
There'll be nothing left to hold together
But if we dislocate
Maybe I would say it better
Even with a parachute
Still, it's just the way I'm falling
If we dislocate

Chorus:
If we start to break (Oh)
There'll be nothing left to hold together
But if we dislocate
Maybe I would say it better
Even with a parachute
Still, it's just the way I'm falling
