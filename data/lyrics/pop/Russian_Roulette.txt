Looked up across the smoke filled room
Felt the tension build
This night has only just begun
So here we go

You gotta, just feel the energy
You gotta, just know who the enemy is
We are hungry for adrenaline
We're about to go insane, you'll see

Bring out the guns, we love the danger
One, two, three, just pull the trigger
One bullet left inside the chamber
Let us play some Russian Roulette
Roulette

Roulette

Let go of everything within
Release the inner peace
This game has only just begun
So here we go

You gotta, just feel the energy
You gotta, just know who the enemy is
We are hungry for adrenaline
We're about to go insane, you'll see

Bring out the guns, we love the danger
One, two, three, just pull the trigger
One bullet left inside the chamber
Let us play some Russian Roulette
Roulette
