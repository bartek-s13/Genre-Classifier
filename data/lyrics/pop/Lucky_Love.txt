Hold my hand feel my love
But understand it's all just luck
No such thing as true love
Its all just luck, lucky love

But that don't make love weak, it's unique
The chances that we'd meet and just speak
A million ways they give just to live
And I'm just lucky this is it, this is it

Plant your feet, take a stand
In the grand scheme, it's all just chance
No such thing as true love
It's all just luck, lucky love

But that don't make love weak, it's unique
The chances that we'd meet and just speak
A million ways they give just to live
