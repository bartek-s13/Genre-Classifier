More than a life
More than I
If not here another time, then you lie
Point to the stars
Is bad of your heart
I'm not here to pick a fight
But we can if you like
Come in they said
Come in you might
Be someone else for a while
And from there I tell you just turn right
Turn the water to wine
Come in they said
Come in you might
Be yourself by the fire
The words don't arrive
The stars don't align
This place isn't mine
To see the whole thing is an opening
A glimpse into the world you wouldn't find
And you don't think it's happening
To see the whole thing is an opening
A glimpse into the world you try to hide
And you don't think it's happening
To see the whole thing is an opening
A glimpse into the world you wouldn't find
And you don't think it's happening
