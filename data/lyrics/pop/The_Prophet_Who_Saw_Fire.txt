How much longer will I witness injustice
Forced to watch the wicked triumph
The defeat in hopelessness
As justice perverts itself
Every ounce of suffering
Writhing like a sickness
The blackened sky falls before man
Too pure to see the evil
Betrayed every unwavered soul
Why is there silence when hope burns
When will judgement take us and put an end to apathy
The plague will come
For the revelation awaits
The fury will see the end of all
In wrath remember humanity
