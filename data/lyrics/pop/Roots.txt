I don't wanna be found out
I dont wanna leave this town tonight
Don't wanna be back where I started from
'Cause my roots won't keep me warm
They won't keep me warm

I only just realised now
It only just dawned on me that I have always been lonely
And I needed this, to feel comfort and complete
I never thought we'd meet

But they said I was always gonna be that way
Until I saw you, I believed them everyday
Then you came my way

Oh, let me love, oh, let me love you, until we're old
Oh, let me love, oh, let me love you, until we're grown
'Cause my roots will never keep me warm

I guess I made it here somehow
I made it this far and I am proud
It's my whole world has changed
Nothing stays the same
And I for one am glad
I never knew I wanted you so bad
But they said I was always gonna be that way
Until I saw you, I believed them everyday
Then you came my way

Oh, let me love, oh, let me love you, until we're old
Oh, let me love, oh, let me love you, until we're grown
'Cause my roots will never keep me warm

And they said I was always gonna be that way
Until I saw you, I believed them everyday
Then you came my way

Oh, let me love, oh, let me love you, until we're old
Oh, let me love, oh, let me love you
'Cause my roots won't keep me warm
My roots won't keep me warm
