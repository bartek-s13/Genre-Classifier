<<<<<<< HEAD
I'm in a, a sea of people, wonderin' if the floor might cave in
I can feel the subs shakin' the apa-artment
Friends of friends are callin' friends who weren't invi-ited
Half the room is brain-dead on some fuckin' island

BYOB, bring your own booze
DIY bongs in the bathroom
She shotgun kissin' the frat boy in the bathtub
He bad news

I wanna get stupid, I wanna get dumb
Lose my inhibitions, dizzy from the drugs
I wanna get stupid, I wanna get dumb
Lose my inhibitions, but I don't trust no one
I don't trust no one

Broke a window, taped it up and hid the evidence
Think I'm gonna get evicted from my residence
Dropped my phone into the toilet and it's evident
I'm out of my element, I'm out of my element

BYOB, bring your own booze
DIY bongs in the bathroom
She shotgun kissing the frat boy in the bathtub
He bad news
I wanna get stupid, I wanna get dumb
Lose my inhibitions, dizzy from the drugs
I wanna get stupid, I wanna get dumb
Lose my inhibitions, but I don't trust no one
I don't trust no one

(I don't trust no one)
(I don't trust no one)

I spy with my little eye
Look to my left, look to my right
Somebody sneaking by the sink
Puttin' anonymous into my drink
Yeah, I don't trust no one
Yeah, I don't trust no-

I wanna get stupid, I wanna get dumb
Lose my inhibitions, dizzy from the drugs
I wanna get stupid, I wanna get dumb
(Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb)
Lose my inhibitions, but I don't trust no one
I don't trust no one
(I don't trust no one)
