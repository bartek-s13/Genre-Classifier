All I saw was eyeballs looking at me sideways
Blurring out my lover's face
Hoping we would die young, drinking like your last day
Letting it all go to waste
Smoking every dollar, hanging on a last laugh
That was all we fucking had
The town was even smaller
Then what made them mad
I’m never going back to that

I still got lovin' for ya
But only some of you, yeah yeah
Already said all of my last goodbyes
I think about you, mama
I think about you, daddy
While I start these fires

I'm a cowboy
Oh, yeah-eh-eh
Yeah-eh-eh-eh, yeah
I’m a cowboy
Oh, yeah-eh-eh
Yeah-eh-eh-eh, yeah
I'm a cowboy, remember my name
Remember my name
And where I came from
Cowboy
Oh, yeah-eh-eh
Yeah-eh-eh-eh, yeah

Honest as a virgin, pissin' holy water
Swear I've never felt so free
I taste it in your body, see it in your anger
I know that you feel like me

I still got lovin' for ya
But only some of you, yeah yeah
Already said all of my last goodbyes
I think about you, mama
I think about you, daddy
While I start these fires

I'm a cowboy
Oh, yeah-eh-eh
Yeah-eh-eh-eh, yeah
I'm a cowboy
Oh, yeah-eh-eh
Yeah-eh-eh-eh, yeah
I'm a cowboy, remember my name
Remember my name
And where I came from
Cowboy
Oh, yeah-eh-eh
Yeah-eh-eh-eh, yeah

Never stop, never stop fallin’ apart
But it doesn’t really hit so hard
Thick skin, dark mind and a broken heart
But it doesn't really hit so hard
Anymore
Anymore
Anymore

’Cause I'm a motherfucking cowboy
Oh, yeah-eh-eh
Yeah-eh-eh-eh, yeah
I'm a motherfucking cowboy
I'm a cowboy
Oh, yeah-eh-eh
Yeah-eh-eh-eh, yeah
I’m a cowboy, remember my name
Remember my name (remember my name)
And where I came from
Cowboy
Oh, yeah-eh-eh
Yeah-eh-eh-eh, yeah

I'm a cowboy
Oh, yeah-eh-eh
Yeah-eh-eh-eh, yeah
I'm a cowboy, remember my name
Remember my name
And where I came from
