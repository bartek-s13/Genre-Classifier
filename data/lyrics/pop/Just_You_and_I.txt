Let's get drunk
I'll pour my heart out through my mouth
This year's been hard for us, no doubt
Let's raise a glass to a better one
Let all the things that we've overcome
Bring hope to us 'cause
Me and you, we can hold this out
Only you understand how I'm feeling now, yeah

And I know I can tell you anything
You won't judge, you're just listening, yeah
'Cause you're the best thing that ever happened to me

'Cause my darling, you and I
Could take over the world
One step at a time
Just you and I (Just you and I)
'Cause you're the only one
Who brings light just like the sun
One step at a time
Just you and I (Just you and I)

Let's get drunk
Reminisce about the days
We were broke, not getting paid
And taking trips on the weekend
When I would drive down to see ya
And we would paint the town
Too many shots, I'll be passing out
'Cause I can never keep up
Quad vods, now I'm puking up

I know I can tell you anything
You won't judge, you're just listening, yeah
'Cause you're the best thing that ever happened to me

'Cause my darling, you and I
Could take over the world
One step at a time
Just you and I (Just you and I)
'Cause you're the only one
Who brings light just like the sun
One step at a time
Just you and I (Just you and I, just you and I)

Tired of chasing paper
Staring at this screen
Been saving up for weeks now
Just to get to you, my dear
And though you're far from my home
This ain't no weekend bar
Oh, my heart grows fonder
Must be city love

'Cause my darling, you and I
Could take over the world
One step at a time
Just you and I
'Cause my darling, you and I
Could take over the world
One step at a time
Just you and I (Just you and I)
'Cause you're the only one
Who brings light just like the sun
One step at a time
Just you and I (Just you and I)

Yeah, one step at a time, just you and I
Yeah, one step at a time, just you and I
