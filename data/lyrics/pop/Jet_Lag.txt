Yeah I’m jet lagged
Took a flight at 6 am just to see you babe
I was feeling real feelings, and they all for you
And I’m messed up now
‘Cause you was gone by 8 am you was leavin’ babe
Now I’m doing anything to get you off my mind
I remember just chillin’ on the west side
In the city that we from, your daddy’s ride
We was filling up our lungs
So high, yeah you got me so high
What goes up must come down
You in love without me now
I got it bad for you
Still got it bad for you
What we lost can’t be found
And you in love without me now
I got it bad for you
Still got it bad for you
You been cuttin’ corners cut me out of your life
Straight up, it’s like I really need to take your advice
But did you hear my fuckin’ song about you
And this is just another song about you
What goes up must come down
You in love without me now
I got it bad for you
Still got it bad for you
What we lost can’t be found
And you in love without me now I got it bad for you
Still got it bad for you
What goes up must come down
You in love without me now
I got it bad for you
Still got it bad for you
What we lost can’t be found
And you in love without me now
I got it bad for you
Still got it bad for you
‘Cause I’m jet lagged
