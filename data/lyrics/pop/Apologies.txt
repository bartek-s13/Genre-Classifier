Apologies
12 steps, you take 'em fast
These moments you can't get it back
Apologies
No, no, no, no apologies

Do I have fool written on top of my head?
You like a book that I already read
I cannot trust all the things that you said
It's all in your face and no, I'm not convinced
Show me your phone and it all will make sense
But if you say no then I know what this is

Now do I have to wait up?
I can't be focused on you, not today
You call me in the morning
Asked did I sleep on the things that you say
And I ain't even noticed
I'm kinda scarred
I'm kinda messed up from you
Asked all my friends and all of my flames
Built up that wall, bulletproof
I give these boys all the blues
'Cause they treat me with affection
But I still think they you (Oh, oh)
It's hard here, baby
To love someone that never gets it right
But always wanna try
