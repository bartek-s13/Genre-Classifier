I was reaching for some other love
And I'm sorry for making things so tough
You were the only one that I could touch
The only one, the only one close enough

When the tears rolled down my face
He turned and walked away
And you held me, oh, you helped me through
As tears rolled down my face
He turned and walked away
When he acted in bad faith

You told me not to hold hands with the devil
You warned me that I'd lose my faith
I never thought I'd leave my heaven
But now I know you're my saving grace
And all we've been through is giving us truth
And now I can never be without you
You told me not to hold hands with the devil
'Cause the devil does no good

I was reaching for another love
But you were the only one that I could trust
I shouldn't held my breath and bit my tongue
I never meant to be so rough
'Cause when the tears rolled down my face
He turned and walked away
And you held me, oh, you helped me through
As tears rolled down my face
He turned and walked away
When he acted in bad faith

You told me not to hold hands with the devil
You warned me that I'd lose my faith
I never thought I'd leave my heaven
But now I know you're my saving grace
And all we've been through is giving us truth
And now I can never be without you
You told me not to hold hands with the devil
'Cause the devil does no good

'Cause the devil does no good
When the tears rolled down my face
He turned and walked away
When he acted in bad faith

You told me not to hold hands with the devil
You warned me that I'd lose my faith
I never thought I'd leave my heaven
But now I know you're my saving grace
And all we've been through is giving us truth
And now I can never be without you
You told me not to hold hands with the devil
'Cause the devil does no good
