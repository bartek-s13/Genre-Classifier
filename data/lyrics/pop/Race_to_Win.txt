I always race to win, keep running 'til the end
I gotta move and stay one step ahead
Stay back and watch me go the only way I know
'Cause nothing's gonna slow me down (oh no!)
I'm running really fast, step back and watch me pass
Doing my best to stay ahead of you
Won't let you catch me, even gonna pass me
Because I think I know a trick or two

Not gonna look back 'cause I don't wanna see
Not gonna worry who is gaining on me
Race to win, race to win, race to win!

The race is getting rough, but I just won't give up
The competition's getting really tight
Not gonna happen, 'cause I'm not stoppin'
No way, no how, I know the end's in sight
I always race to win, keep running 'til the end
I gotta move and stay one step ahead
Stay back and watch me go the only way I know
Because you know I always race
Always race
