<<<<<<< HEAD
I know you know
We don't see
We sow our truth
Wait patiently

I walk the streets with a song in my head
(We ebb and we flow, so)
Got my toes on my pup at the foot of my bed
(My heart always seems to know)
Now take the glitz back, I want the soul instead
'Cause I found some kind of fairytale

I used to hover
Outside my truth
Always worry
Of what I'd lose

Take away my record deal
(Go on, I don't need it)
Spent the last two years getting to what's real
(And now I can see so clear)
I hope you feel just like I feel
I found some kind of fairytale

Want a garden by the ocean tide
Because I lose my way searching for stage lights
Well, Stevie knows and I thank her so
'Cause it's your seeds I sow and now I know

Nolita, flat on rent control
(That's the life I choose)
And you drag me to the fashion show
(The poses that I see through)
And Ruby's in the afternoon
'Cause I found some kind of fairy, tale, hey

Nolita Fairytale
