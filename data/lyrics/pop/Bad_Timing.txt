You're heading out, as I'm coming home
But I haven't seen you in forever
We steal a kiss, and you close the door
I guess we're alone in this together

'Cause life keeps getting between us
And it's all too heavy to keep up anymore

We stuck by it, we kept trying
But there's no fighting bad timing
I wish we'd met each other five years later
'Cause I hate the way we're being torn apart
We stuck by it, we kept trying
But there's no fighting bad timing, bad timing

Well I miss the nights, we'd lie awake
Both throwing shadows at the ceiling
We needed days, me and you
To try to recreate the feeling

But life keeps getting between us
And it's all too heavy to keep up anymore
We stuck by it, we kept trying
But there's no fighting bad timing
I wish we'd met each other five years later
'Cause I hate the way we're being torn apart
We stuck by it, we kept trying
But there's no fighting bad timing, bad timing

Oh woah
Oh woah
Oh woah oh
Oh woah
Oh woah
Oh woah oh

I wish we'd met each other five years later
'Cause I hate the way we're being torn apart
We stuck by it, kept trying
But there's no fighting bad timing
It's just bad timing, bad timing
Bad timing, it's just bad timing
