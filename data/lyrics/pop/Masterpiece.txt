<<<<<<< HEAD
So much pressure, why so loud?
If you don't like my sound you can turn it down
I got a road, and I walk it alone
Uphill battle, I look good when I climb
I'm ferocious, precocious I get braggadocios
I'm not gonna stop, I like the view from the top

You talk that blah blah
That la la, that rah rah shit
And I'm so done, I'm so over it
Sometimes I mess up, I eff up, I hit and miss
But I'm okay, I'm cool with it

I still fall on my face sometimes
And I, can't colour inside the lines
Cause, I'm perfectly incomplete
I'm still working on my masterpiece
And I, I wanna hang with the greatest
Got a way to go, but it's worth the wait
No, you haven't seen the best of me
I'm still working on my masterpiece

Those who mind don't matter
Those who matter don't mind
If you don't catch what I'm throwing
Then I leave you behind
Gone in a flash
And I am living like that, yeah

They talk that blah blah
That la la, that rah rah shit
Go with the punches, and take the hits
Sometimes I mess up, I eff up, I swing and miss
But it's okay, I'm cool with it

I still fall on my face sometimes
And I, can't colour inside the lines
Cause, I'm perfectly incomplete
I'm still working on my masterpiece
And I, I wanna hang with the greatest
Got a way to go, but it's worth the wait
No, you haven't seen the best of me
I'm still working on my masterpiece

I still fall on my face sometimes
And I, can't colour inside the lines
Cause, I'm perfectly incomplete
I'm still working on my masterpiece
And I, I wanna hang with the greatest
Got a way to go, but it's worth the wait
No, you haven't seen the best of me
I'm still working on my masterpiece

I still fall on my face sometimes
And I, can't colour inside the lines
Cause, I'm perfectly incomplete
I'm still working on my masterpiece
And I, I wanna hang with the greatest
Got a way to go, but it's worth the wait
No, you haven't seen the best of me
