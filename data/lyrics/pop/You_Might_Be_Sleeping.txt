Baby, when you're near (you're near)
It's warm (it's warm) inside (inside)
Sometimes when you stare (you stare)
Our hearts (our hearts) entwine (entwine)

And in the morning I'll be here
You might be sleeping without a care
And in the morning I'll be here
You might be dreaming
Play with your hair

When I think about you, boy
My sadness disappears
I could lay around forever
You wipe away my tears

And in the morning I'll be here (I'll be here)
