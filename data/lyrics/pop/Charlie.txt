And I know it's bad
But I just can't wait
Till you feel in love
When you see my face
Well, I go to bed
But I'm still awake
When you go to bed
Do you sleep like a babe?

I just want coffee for breakfast
I just want warm cups of tea
I just might love you forever
I hope you warm up to me
I hope your dreams are amazing
I hope your dreams are amazing

My dad, he worked out west
And he worked so hard
My mum she smells like cigarettes
And they broke each other's hearts
She says that love is like a chess game
And boys gotta do the chasing
But when did I start taking her advice?
I raised myself and that's alright

I want coffee for breakfast
I want warm cups of tea
I'm gonna love you forever
I hope you warm up to me
I hope your dreams are amazing
I hope your dreams are amazing
Hope your dreams are amazing
I hope I maybe sneak my way in, I'd like that

Oh, I was really feeling nothing
But you got me feeling something
And it's heartfelt like ice melts when winter turns to spring
And I keep your pictures like a hoarder
I think about you when I sing
Said you can lead a horse to water but you can't always make it drink

So I drink coffee for breakfast
I want warm cups of tea
I just might love you forever
I hope you warm up to me
I think you might be my angel
Think you might be an angel
I think you might be an angel
I think you might be

All you gotta do is wait for me to get home
Like Charlie in the rain outside
All I wanna do is see you when I get home
Like Charlie in the rain outside
All you gotta do is wait for me to get home
Like Charlie in the rain outside
All I wanna do is see you when I get home
Like Charlie in the rain outside

I want coffee for breakfast
I just want warm cups of tea
I just might love you forever
I hope you warm up to me
I think you might be my angel
I think you might be my angel
I think you might be my angel
