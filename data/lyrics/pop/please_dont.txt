Please don’t give up on me
I know I'm not perfect, but I'm trying
I said, I'm trying
So, please don’t give up on me
I know I'm not perfect, but I'm trying
You’re the only person that I've ever trusted
Never forcing me to talk until I'm adjusted,
so I
Just wanted to thank you
I know I can be difficult,
I know I can be sad,
But for some reason, you’re still here
Standing to my side
So, please don’t give up on me.
I know I'm not perfect, but I'm trying
You’re stuck by my side
And I don’t why
But please don’t go
I don’t want you to go
I don't want you to go
And I know I can difficult and hard to understand
But for reason so far you’ve stuck around,
So please don’t leave me now
Please don't leave me now
It might seem a little selfish
If it is I am so sorry
I just don’t feel safe without you
When you’re gone it just feels so goddamn dreary
So goddamn dreary
And I wanna be there for you too
I mean that’s the least I can do
I'm just working on myself
And I need a little help to make it through
So thank you being here for me
Even if sometimes I disagree
With things you have to say to me
But your honesty is really key
Please don’t give up on me.
I know I'm not perfect, but I’m trying
I'm trying
Please don’t give up on me
I'm still just learning
Taking baby steps as I go
Steps as I go
Please don’t give up on me
I know I'm not perfect, but I'm trying
I'm trying
Please
