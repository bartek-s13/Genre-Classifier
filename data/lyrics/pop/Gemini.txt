No, I'm not trying to complicate it
I just want to feel okay
Because I'm tired of always waking up
In this unfamiliar place
I've been over and under
Coming round in circles
It don't seem to make it easier for me
No it don't, yeah

No I don't think about it
No, I don't drink about it
But you got me in a tangle
And I got myself into the sweetest disposition
