Can’t you hear it
Can’t you hear that
Unlocked talking heavy sounds of fear and fight
You breathe a little deeper than I thought you might
If you wanna wake up, if you wanna wake up
Walk out crystal quiet with your eyes wide shut
Sleep
Sleep
Sleep
Sleep
Can’t you, hear it
Can’t you hear that
Sweaty hands in blanket land on the coldest of nights
You breathe a little deeper than I thought you might
If you wanna wake up, if you wanna wake up
Walk out crystal quiet with your eyes wide shut
Sleep
Can’t you hear it
Can’t you hear that
