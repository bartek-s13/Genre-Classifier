You, you make me feel like me
Oh, the air you breathe takes me in
I, I didn't know that I
Had been in your eyes for a while

So if this is the way to go
The feels we hold are just another road
Taking us to nowhere

Don't hide, don't hide
'Cause I don't wanna do this, I don't wanna do that
Don't hide, don't hide
'Cause I don't wanna do this, I don't wanna do that

Don't hide, don't hide
'Cause I don't wanna, I don't wanna
Don't hide, don't hide
Don't hide, don't hide
'Cause I don't wanna, I don't wanna
Don't hide, don't hide
Don't hide, don't hide
'Cause I don't wanna, I don't wanna
Don't hide, don't hide

This, this could be everything
Not just anything, lets unfold
But we, we need to find it out
How we do without or just turn around

So if this is the way to go
The feels we hold are just another road
Taking us to nowhere

Don't hide, don't hide
'Cause I don't wanna do this, I don't wanna do that
Don't hide, don't hide
'Cause I don't wanna do this, I don't wanna do that

Don't hide, don't hide
'Cause I don't wanna, I don't wanna
Don't hide, don't hide
Don't hide, don't hide
'Cause I don't wanna, I don't wanna
Don't hide, don't hide

Don't hide, don't hide
'Cause I don't wanna do this, I don't wanna do that
