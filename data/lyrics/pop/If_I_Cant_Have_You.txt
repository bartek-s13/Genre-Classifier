Why won't you look at me?
I'm standing at the door
I brought you cookies, your favourite kind
Why won't you look at me?
Am I too much?
Have I crossed a line?

I don't get it
And if we were older, it might be different
And I've since abandoned
The thought of your hand in mine again

I'll take the clothes on the floor
I'll take the glow of the screen
I'll take the nights that we fought about sharing a bed with me
I'll take the notebook you filled with all of my favourite things
I'll even take the faithfulness you never gave to me
If I can't have you

Why don't you talk to me?
Why don't you let me in?
I'll give you patience if you give me time
And I gave you everything
But you wanted less of me

I don't get it
And if we were older, it might be different
And thank God that we don't need lawyers
We couldn't afford it (We couldn't afford it, oh)

I'll take the clothes on the floor
I'll take the glow of the screen
I'll take the nights that we fought about sharing a bed with me
I'll take the notebook you filled with all of my favourite things
I'll even take the faithfulness you never gave to me
If I can't have you

I'll be alright
And I hope you're okay too
I'll be alright
And I hope you're okay too
I'll be alright (I'll be alright, I'll be alright)
And I hope you're okay too (I'll be alright)
I'll be alright (I'll be alright, I'll be alright)
And I hope you're okay too

I'll take the clothes on the floor
I'll take the glow of the screen
I'll take the nights that we fought about sharing a bed with me
I'll take the notebook you filled with all of my favourite things
I'll even take the faithfulness you never gave to me
