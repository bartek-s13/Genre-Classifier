I feel, I feel the ending
Before it even starts
My jacket's under the table
Your sneakers are right where they usually are
We're a touch away from naked
One touch from never changing
Yeah, we know we shouldn't but
We're always letting us down
Drop our two cents on the carpet
In your studio apartment
Yeah, we know we shouldn't 'cause

We go from hot, hot
To slam and shut the doors till they crack
We go from love, love
To saying shit that we can't take back
But every time that we walk out
We just keep coming back
Like we forget to forget
Forget to forget about us
Each time, time
Promise this time will be the last
'Cause we both know
It's a mistake waking up in this bed
But every time that we walk out
We just keep coming back
Like we forget to forget
Forget to forget about us
I know, I know this bedroom
Better than I know mine
Your boyhood still in the wardrobe
You hid it away like you usually do
We're a touch away from naked
One touch from never changing
Yeah, we know we shouldn't but
We're always letting us down
Drop our two cents on the carpet
In your studio apartment
Yeah, we know we shouldn't 'cause

We go from hot, hot
To slam and shut the doors till they crack
We go from love, love
To saying shit that we can't take back
But every time that we walk out
We just keep coming back
Like we forget to forget
Forget to forget about us
Each time, time
Promise this time will be the last
'Cause we both know
It's a mistake waking up in this bed
But every time that we walk out
We just keep coming back
Like we forget to forget
Forget to forget about us
I feel, I feel the ending
Before it even starts
