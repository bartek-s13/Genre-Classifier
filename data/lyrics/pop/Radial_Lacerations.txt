What is left when my dreams are dark?
Shrouded in the emptiness
Of self-disgust
Every distant light consumed
Grasping on to chaos, I fall deeper (Deeper)
Poisoned by the constant droning of the conscious mind
An empty thought
Dragging on
For the sake of living
Stifle the light
Until death I won't feel
Yeah
Every lingered feeling
Every distant cry
Every shallow word
Carved into my skin
Every lingered feeling
Every distant cry
Every shallow word
Carved into my skin
(Every lingered feeling
Every distant cry
Every shallow word)
