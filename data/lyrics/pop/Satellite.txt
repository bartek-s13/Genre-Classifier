There's a wall around your body
You're scared to love somebody
There's a wall around your words
And that's alright with me
Yeah, that's alright with me
I don't mean to cause no harm
As I sit with you in your car
I don't mean to break your heart
If it's not right for you
I won't fight with you

I see you sending out your satellite
But that's not really who you are
You push away just when it feels right
I see you picking it apart
Want it to end before it starts
You're like a rabbit in the headlights
Running straight into the car
I see you sending out your satellite
That's not really who you are

Let's not overthink
'Cause this boat you built's about to sink
Let's not overthink
'Cause I'm alright with this
If you don't have time for this

I see you sending out your satellite
That's not really who you are
You push away just when it feels right
I see you picking it apart
Want it to end before it starts
You're like a rabbit in the headlights
Running straight into the car
I see you sending out your satellite
But that's not really who you are

I'm not here to push you
Push you on a stage
I'm here to tell you
I read the same page
I'm tryna tell you
I see you for you
I'm tryna tell you

I see you sending out your satellite
But that's not really who you are
You push away just when it feels right
I see you picking it apart
Want it to end before it starts
You're like a rabbit in the headlights
Running straight into the car
I see you sending out your satellite
But that's not really who you are
I see you sending out your satellite
But that's not really who you are
You push away just when it feels right
I see you picking it apart
Want it to end before it starts
You're like a rabbit in the headlights
Running straight into the car
I see you sending out your satellite
