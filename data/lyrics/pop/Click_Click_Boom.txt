All those Saturdays when kids go out and play
Yo, I was up in my room – I let the stereo blaze
Wasn't faded, not jaded
Just a kid with a pad and pen and a big imagination
All this, I seek, I find
I push the envelope to the line
Make it, break it, take it
Until I'm overrated

Click, click, boom!
I'm comin' down on the stereo
Hear me on the radio
Click, click, boom!
I'm comin' down with a new style
And you know it's buck wild
Click, click, boom!
I'm on the radio station
Tourin' 'round the nation
Leavin' the scene in devastation

I can see it in my mind
I can see it in their eyes
It's close enough to touch it now
But far away enough to die
What the hell is wrong with me?
My mom and dad weren't perfect
But still you don't hear no cryin' ass-bitchin' from me
Like there seems to be on everybody's CD
So just sit back and relax and let me have your head for a minute
I can show you somethin' in it that has yet to be presented, oh, yeah!

Click, click, boom!
I'm comin' down on the stereo
Hear me on the radio
Click, click, boom!
I'm comin' down with a new style
And you know it's buck wild
Click, click, boom!
I'm on the radio station
Tourin' 'round the nation
Leavin' the scene in devastation

Why have I clouded up my mind?
Why's my mother always right?
And will I make it 'til the end
Or will I crawl away and die?

All those Saturdays when kids go out and play
Yo, I was up in my room – I let the stereo blaze
On Saturdays when kids go out and play
I was up in my room – I let the stereo blaze
It's all inside of me, it's all inside of me
It's all inside of me, it's all inside of my head
It's all inside of me, it's comin' over me
It's all inside of me, it's all inside my head, yeah!
Click, click, boom!
I'm comin' down on the stereo
Hear me on the radio
Click, click, boom!
I'm comin' down with a new style
And you know it's buck wild

Everybody, everybody, come on! Come on, come on!
Everybody, come on! Come on, come on!
Click, click, boom!
Come on, come on!
Everybody, come on! Come on, come on!
Click, click, boom!
Come on, come on!
Everybody, come on! Come on, come on!
Click, click, boom!
Come on, come on!
Everybody, come on! Come on, come on!
