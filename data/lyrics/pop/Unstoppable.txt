Here we are, here are you
A starlit night, moment of truth
I stumble on all my words for you tonight
(tonight)
Don't you worry about a thing
Cause there's no one listening
And we can work through the mystery of our lives
It's me and you forever
Through thick and thin and stormy weather
I didn't plan for this, but I think I'm ready
We're unstoppable (x2)
I find myself drifting off
The ocean view is steady enough
I catch your light
I've been chasing for a thousand days, a thousand nights
Don't you worry about a thing
Cause you'll get that diamond ring
And we can fall in the mystery of our lives
It's me and you forever
Through thick and thin and stormy weather
I didn't plan for this, but I think I'm ready
We're unstoppable (x3)
Now I'm waiting on, waiting on
The answer to me and you
Please forgive me cause I get vulnerable
Sometimes
It's me and you forever
Through thick and thin or stormy weather
I couldn't plan for this, thank god I'm ready
We're unstoppable
