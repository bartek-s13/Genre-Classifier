Home grown alligator, see you later
Gotta hit the road, gotta hit the road
Something changed in the atmosphere
Architecture unfamiliar
I could get used to this

Time flies by in the yellow and green
Stick around and you'll see what I mean
There's a mountain-top that I'm dreamin' of
If you need me you know where I'll be

I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone

South of the Equator, navigator
Gotta hit the road, gotta hit the road
Deep sea divin' 'round the clock
Bikini bottoms, lager tops
I could get used to this

Time flies by in the yellow and green
Stick around and you'll see what I mean
There's a mountain-top that I'm dreamin' of
If you need me you know where I'll be

I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone

We got two in the front
Two in the back
Sailin' along
And we don't look back
(Back, back, back-back-back-back...)

Time flies by in the yellow and green
Stick around and you'll see what I mean
There's a mountain-top that I'm dreamin' of
If you need me you know where I'll be

I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone, a someone, a someone, a someone...
