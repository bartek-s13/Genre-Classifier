Yeah (Yeah)

So, you say you're moving out of state
Soon as you graduate, interesting (Yeah)
Anyway, you're leaving
Need a hug? Okay then
Call me up, no thanks, man (Yeah)

I'm too busy, don't have time for
Things you say that aren't important
Where's the bathroom at?
Leave me alone

I just came here to the party for the drugs (Drugs)
Drugs (Drugs), drugs (Drugs)
I'm not tryna make a friend or fall in love (Love)
Love (Love), love (Love)
So just stop the faking
Not for here for nameless faces
Pointless talking, conversations (Drugs)
Drugs (Drugs), drugs (Drugs)
I just came here for the drugs
Look who's here, pink t-shirt
Oh, you met him last year?
Wish I was as cool as you (Oh, yeah)
Check it out, you got that
Brand new Audi hatchback
But you came here alone
You're too drunk to drive home (Oh, yeah)

I'm too busy, don't have time for
Things you say that aren't important
Where's the bathroom at?
Leave me alone

I just came here to the party for the drugs (Drugs)
Drugs (Drugs), drugs (Drugs)
I'm not tryna make a friend or fall in love (Love)
Love (Love), love (Love)
So just stop the faking
Not for here for nameless faces
Pointless talking, conversations (Drugs)
Drugs (Drugs), drugs (Drugs)
I just came here for the drugs
Everybody's either here for the drugs
Or the sex or the money or the fame
He's on the phone asking someone for the plug
And she's on the couch small talking, dropping names
I'm not for here for nameless faces
Pointless talking, conversations (Drugs)
Drugs (Drugs), drugs
