Chasing fairytales and silver screens
Perfect endings and engagement rings
Time is skating on thin ice
Maybe I need to compromise

My mind weighs heavy I've been on the road
I'm not sure which way to go
Wish your face lit up the sky
Constellation I could find
Will the stars realign

Going through the motions
Drowning in the ocean
Can you come and rescue me
Going through the motions

Fantasy took control of me
Always something wrong with what i see
Oh one check off and i get caught up
Nothing seems to be enough

My mind weighs heavy I've been on the road
I'm not sure which way to go
Wish your face lit up the sky
Constellation I could find
Will the stars realign

Going through the motions
Drowning in the ocean
Can you come and rescue me
Going through the motions
I’m gone
