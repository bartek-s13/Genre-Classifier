You said I could get no one better
You said I am the best you'll be
But then you found she took your place and
She's sitting in my car seat

I’m climbing up your back but if only
You’d turn around and shaking me off
You know that I have always been lonely
But with you it's probably good enough
I’m climbing up your back but if only
You'd turn around and shaking me off
You know that I have always been lonely

And you said that I have always been heartless
You're a compass in every direction in the back of my mind
You're the house at the end of my street
You're the carpet on my wall and you're falling down slowly
And you wake up at the side of the road with a fear in your eye
You're the house at the end of my street
You're the carpet on my wall
Well it's winter in my head but it's summer right in everyone’s heart
And then I wake up and I get out of bed and start again and carry it on

And it doesn't matter
I really like her
She's like a best friend
Without the taste
It doesn't matter
You'll never meet her
You will regret that
We went away

I’m climbing up your back but if only
You’d turn around and shaking me off
You know that I have always been lonely
