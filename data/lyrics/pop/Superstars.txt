It's just a summer night
But baby, drinks are flowing
We're doing what we like
We'll worry in the morning
You've got a killer vibe
And I think you know it
Don't have a nine-to-five
Let's keep this moment going

'Cause I've learnt to enjoy the little things
And right now, I think you'd be good with me
Let's take on the night, just the both of us
No growing up, yeah, no one's in a rush
Don't care where we are, cause you're perfect
And you make me feel like it's worth it
Forever? Tonight? What's the difference?
As long as we feel like we're living

Something about you makes me feel alive
The only one who makes the dark turn to light
And I can't go back after what we had
Forever? Tonight? What's the difference?
As long as we feel like we're living
Something about you, something about you, whoa, whoa
Something about you, something about you, whoa, whoa

We're standing real close
I'm needing you the most
It's like you read my mind
And you know that I
Love those pants that you cuff like you do
With those white no shows and Adidas shoes

'Cause I've learnt to enjoy the little things
And right now, I think you'd be good with me
Let's take on the night, just the both of us
No growing up, yeah, no one's in a rush
Don't care where we are, cause you're perfect
And you make me feel like it's worth it
Forever? Tonight? What's the difference?
As long as we feel like we're living

Something about you makes me feel alive
The only one who makes the dark turn to light
And I can't go back after what we had
Forever? Tonight? What's the difference?
As long as we feel like we're living
Something about you makes me feel alive
The only one who makes the dark turn to light
And I can't go back after what we had
Forever? Tonight? What's the difference?
As long as we feel like we're living

Something about you
Something about you
Something about you makes me feel ali-
The only one who makes the dark turn to light
And I can't go back after what we had
Forever? Tonight? What's the difference?
As long as we feel like we're living
(Just as long as we feel like we're living)
