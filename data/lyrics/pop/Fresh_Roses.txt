Darling, I’ve been trying to hold you down
Though the fear within my heart still lingers round
Darling I am hoping to see your face
Every Sunday morn in my embrace

And though the fear within my heart still drives me over the edge
It is you that I want to hold me in bed
And should the sun shine tomorrow I’ll be holding my head
Cause I’ll be hoping for raindrops instead

Fresh roses in my garden need the rain
I’ve been hoping for clouds, but the sun remains
Fresh roses in my garden need the rain
Heaven sent me your love, but it keeps me chained

Darling I was searching for the light within
When you came on in placed my world in a spin
I was aching when you came around
Funny how things work, how my world was upside down

And though the fear within my heart still drives me over the edge
It is you that I want to hold me in bed
And should the sun shine tomorrow I’ll be holding my head
Cause I’ll be hoping for raindrops instead
Fresh roses in my garden need the rain
I’ve been hoping for clouds, but the stars remains
Fresh roses in my garden need the rain
Heaven sent me your love, but it keeps me chained

I’ll bide my time and i will wait
Patiently for the day
When the clouds are dark and the skies are red
To feel your love over me

Fresh roses in my garden need the rain
I’ve been hoping for clouds, but the sun remains
Fresh roses in my garden need the rain
Heaven sent me your love, but it keeps me chained
