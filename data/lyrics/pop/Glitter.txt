Everyone else has left now
I bet that this got you stressed out
Wonderin', what can we do now?
Maybe let it burn out
Where I can’t feel my face
Mm, minds twisted in weird ways
Wonderin', what can we do now?
Maybe let it burn out

Glitter's sparklin’ on your heart now, darling
Won't you stay?
I'm here wonderin' what to say
You're putting me away now

I know it's getting late now, baby
Maybe you should stay here with me
Let's just make it our own party
Stick together like glitter, glitter, glitter, glitter

Race against the sunlight
Wanna have a long night
Night mysteries, night mysteries
Under spotlight, don't let me out of your sight
Two energies, two energies
Glitter’s sparklin’ on your heart now, darling
Won't you stay? (Ooh)
I’m here wonderin' what to say
You're putting me away now

I know it's getting late now, baby
Maybe you should stay here with me
Let’s just make it our own party
Stick together like glitter, glitter, glitter, glitter
I know it's getting late now, baby (Late now)
Maybe you should stay here with me
Let's just make it our own party (Party)
Stick together like glitter, glitter, glitter, glitter

Everyone else has left now
I bet that this got you stressed out
Wonderin', what can we do now?
Maybe let it burn out
