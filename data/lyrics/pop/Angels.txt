I sit and wait, does an angel contemplate my fate?
And do they know the places where we go when we're grey and old?
Cause I have been told that salvation lets their wings unfold
So when I'm lying in my bed, thoughts running through my head
And I feel that love is dead, I'm loving angels instead

And through it all, she offers me protection
A lot of love and affection, whether I'm right or wrong
And down the waterfall, wherever it may take me
I know that life won't break me
When I come to call, she won't forsake me
I'm loving angels instead

When I'm feeling weak and my pain walks down a one-way street
I look above and I know I'll always be blessed with love
And as the feeling grows, she breathes flesh to my bones
And when love is dead, I'm loving angels instead

And through it all she offers me protection
A lot of love and affection, whether I'm right or wrong
And down the waterfall, wherever it may take me
I know that life won't break me
When I come to call, she won't forsake me

I'm loving angels instead
And through it all, she offers me protection
A lot of love and affection, whether I'm right or wrong
And down the waterfall, wherever it may take me
I know that life won't break me
When I come to call, she won't forsake me
I'm loving angels instead
