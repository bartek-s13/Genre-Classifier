She rides it like a rodeo
It feels like I'm in heaven 24/7, ay

We doing business in the lobby
No nine-to-five's, only hobbies
You get mad, I'm in a hurry (Yeah)
I'm way too busy to feel sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

Don't start to care for me
Don't need your sympathy, sympathy
Just give me your energy, energy, ay
She said she want something more
I said that's not what I'm looking for
But baby, don't leave me, don't leave me though
Keep doing those things that I love

She rides it like a rodeo
It feels like I'm in heaven 24/7, ay
Paris, Milan, or Tokyo
She got me working on vacation 24/7, ay
Ooh, ooh
It feels like I'm in heaven 24/7, yeah
Ooh, aah
She got me working on vacation 24/7
I'm trippin' on insomnia (Can't get no sleep, hey)
Seing things like I'm in Narnia (Fantasy shit)
All this drinking makes it blurry (Wooh)
I'm way too dizzy to be worried, no worries, no worries

Don't start to care for me
Don't need your sympathy, sympathy
Just give me your energy, energy, ay
She said she want something more

It feels like I'm in heaven 24/7, yeah
Ooh, aah
She got me working on vacation 24/7

She rides it like a rodeo
Giving me all kinds of heaven 24/7
L.A., New York, or Mexico
She got me working on vacation 24/7, ay
Ooh, ooh
It feels like I'm in heaven 24/7, yeah
Ooh, aah
