Focus on you in the light, it helps me fill my emotions
Why are we at such a distance? Find ourselves so out of frame
This love stays calm in the night, yeah, help me heal and reopen
Why are we drifting away from everything we wanted to save?

I told you I'd be down forever
Loving you is danger, but it don't feel wrong
It's old news, I should look for better
Falling back to strangers, leave me hanging on

Flare guns go off in my head, saying not to call you this late
Still I dial those numbers every time
Why do I replay those messages that you left at the tone last May?
Slowly wishing you were never mine

Your face became all I know, I'd try to picture another
Why are we frayed at the edge, it's making me feel I’m to blame
I wanna know what's the deal
Where have you been and what do you think of me?
Is there a new girl silently screaming your name?

I told you I'd be down forever
Loving you is danger, but it don't feel wrong
It's old news, I should look for better
Falling back to strangers, leave me hanging on
You leave me hanging on

Flare guns go off in my head, saying not to call you this late
Still I dial those numbers every time
Why do I replay those messages that you left at the tone last May?
Slowly wishing you were never mine

I told you I'd be down forever
Loving you is danger, but it don't feel wrong
It's old news, I should look for better
Falling back to strangers, leave me hanging on

See, I don't know better than to give up on loving
Why am I still holding on? I'm still holding on
And I'm way too honest and you make me want it
Lying alone all night long, alone all night long

When flare guns go off in my head, saying not to call you this late
Still I dial those numbers every time
Why do I replay those messages that you left at the tone last May?
Slowly wishing you were never mine

Flare guns go off in my head, saying not to call you this late
Still I dial those numbers every time
(Still I dial those numbers every time)
Why do I replay those messages that you left at the tone last May?
Slowly wishing you were never mine
(Slowly wishing you were never mine)
