Once you know what I got to say
That'll explain why
And how I feel at the end of the day
It's to do with you
And I

Is that a question on your mind
Or did I read you wrong
I don't know what you feel inside
Sometimes I've tried
But it's gone
It's gone
It's gone
It's gone
It's gone
It's gone
It's gone
It's gone

Don't need me as your friend
I'm thinking that you just stand close
Whilst a different sin
Yeah
Yeah
