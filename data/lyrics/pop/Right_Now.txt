I got my headphones on today
Now get your fake news outta my face
Ain't got no bills I have to pay
There could be a missile headed straight my way
Airbrush, airbrush, my life be like airbrush
Even when the world is the worst
Too much, too much, people complain too much
Hate me but that's not my concern

I'm feeling so alive right now
I feel like I could fly
Like I could touch the sky right now
I guess I got my head in the clouds
(wooo) Right now, right now
(wooo) Right now, right now
I'm not phased by the things you gotta say
I guess I got my head in the clouds

I'm a believer, this ain't no pill in a bottle
I got a fever, that keep that heat on the throttle
Got all the pretty women, I mean whatever you say
I'm not a player, shhh, I run the play
We got em' moving from New York to L.A
Got all the angels tell the devil he ain't welcome today
I know you probably not a saint the way you whip at the waist
You gotta know that this the time and the place

I'm feeling so alive right now
I feel like I could fly
Like I could touch the sky right now
I guess I got my head in the clouds
(wooo) Right now, right now
(wooo) Right now, right now
I'm not phased by the things you gotta say
I guess I got my head in the clouds

(wooo)
(wooo)
(wooo) Right now, right now
(wooo) Right now, right now
I'm not phased by the things you gotta say
I guess I got my head in the clouds
(wooo)
