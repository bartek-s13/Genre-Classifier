Yeah

Soon I'm on a plane
Doing the same, same shit that I always do
You be handsome, but I finna go talk
Now it's just me and you
Me and you

So skip all the screaming and shouting
Let go of the blaming and crying
I don't wanna waste time on fighting
Now, I know that it's probably crazy
But I need you to call me your baby
Even if you have to fake it

Just tell me your sweet lies, sweet lies
And then look at my sad eyes, sad eyes
Let's pretend this one last time
Before we go and kill all the good vibes

2 AM cab rides
Hotels and strobe lights
Falling asleep alone
You have that day job, hey, but it pays off
Can't stand that I'm not home
I'm not home
Sick of the screaming and shouting
Let go of the blaming and crying
I don't wanna waste time on fighting, no
Yeah, I know that it's probably crazy
But I need you to call me your baby
Even if you have to fake it

Just tell me your sweet lies, sweet lies
And then look at my sad eyes, sad eyes
Let's pretend this one last time
Before we go and kill all the good vibes
Just tell me your sweet lies, sweet lies
And I'll play it all like I don't mind
Let's pretend this one last time
Before we go and kill all the good vibes

Give me one last high
Give me one last night
And a kiss goodbye, would you?
Give me one last high
Give me one last night
And a kiss goodbye, would you?
Would you, would you?
Just tell me your sweet lies, sweet lies
And then look at my sad eyes, sad eyes
Let's pretend this one last time
Before we go and kill all the good vibes
Just tell me your sweet lies, sweet lies
And I'll play it all like I don't mind
Let's pretend this one last time
Before we go and kill all the good vibes

Give me one last high
Give me one last night
And a kiss goodbye, would you?
Give me one last high
Give me one last night
And a kiss goodbye, would you?
Would you, would you?
Give me one last high
Give me one last night
And a kiss goodbye, would you?
Give me one last high
Give me one last night
And a kiss goodbye, would you?
