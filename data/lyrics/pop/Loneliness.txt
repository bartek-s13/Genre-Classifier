Loneliness has had its chances
But I know it won't win
And depression is a romantic
But I won't spend my life with him

'Cause I got you baby
And you got me too
Well that's enough for me
Yes I got, you baby
When my world is blue, you're just the thing I need

And tenderness has been my weakness
But I know it's a gift
And the sensitive part of me needs it
Without that I can't live

'Cause I got you baby
And you got me too
Well that's enough for me
Yes I got, you baby
When my world is blue, you're just the thing I need


'Cause I got you baby
And you got me too
Well that's enough for me
Yes I got, you baby
