You know we had our sun
Until we lost the leaves they keep on falling
As winter's just begun
You know I'll do my best to keep the warm in

I thought of you this morning bet you didn't do the same
Keep searching through my presents though I don't ever see your name, oh oh

I  know I'll never be the top of your list
The one you run to for your mistletoe, mistletoe kiss
The arms that hold you when the cold sets in
But I'm glad you found the one that you're happy with
Mhm, whoever he is

I know we lost our love
But maybe in our dreams it's me you're kissing
I'm tired of waking up
Searching through the sheets to find you're missing

I thought of you this morning bet you didn't do the same
Keep searching through my presents though I don't ever see your name (oh oh oh)
I know I'll never be the top of your list
The one you run to for your mistletoe, mistletoe kiss
The arms that hold you when the cold sets in
But I'm glad you found one that you're happy with
Mhm, whoever he is
Whoever he is

I thought of you this morning bet you didn't do the same
Keep searching through my presents though I don't ever see your name

I know I'll never be the top of your list (of your list)
The one you run to for your mistletoe, mistletoe kiss
The arms that hold you when the cold sets in (cold sets in)
But I'm glad you found the one that you're happy with
I know I'll never be the top of your list (of your list)
The one you run to for your mistletoe, mistletoe kiss
The arms that hold you when the cold sets in (cold sets in)
But I'm glad you found the one that you're happy with
Mhm, whoever he is
Oh, whoever he is
