It's a perfect timing, you and I so blinding
You're out of hopes, I'm head over heels
Nothing complicated, it's a cause of nature
Got us back the taste

Open your eyes
Then you know you've got that affection on me, yeah you do
And realize
You will know, you will know that eventually, you'll be mine
