A tornado running wild
It'll be my saviour, hold my hand
And through the darkness it'll rip you from highest land
So do me a favour and take me quietly

So slow down
Feel the fire in your chest
Oh, I know now
You make me feel so good
Make me feel so

Take me to a small death (hate the way we're almost there)
This could be my last breath (why am I supposed to care?)
I'm blind to all the darkness (wanna lie with you and I won't be scared)
I'm trying to be honest, I'm almost, I'm almost

I hear you calling out my name, name
Do I give in or walk straight?

So slow down
Feel the fire in your chest
Oh, I know now
You make me feel so good
Make me feel so
Take me to a small death (hate the way we're almost there)
This could be my last breath (why am I supposed to care?)
I'm blind to all the darkness (wanna lie with you and I won't be scared)
I'm trying to be honest, I'm almost, I'm almost
Take me to a small death (hate the way we're almost there)
This could be my last breath (why am I supposed to care?)
I'm blind to all the darkness (wanna lie with you and I won't be scared)
I'm trying to be honest, I'm almost, I'm almost

Hold me here
Wash away
Take me from day to day
And do I care or will I cave?
Stepping off this paper page
And will I last to the love
I try so hard to give up
And in my lies
To the day
Terrified I'll never change

Take me to a small death (hate the way we're almost there)
This could be my last breath (why am I supposed to care?)
I'm blind to all the darkness (wanna lie with you and I won't be scared)
I'm trying to be honest, I'm almost, I'm almost
We are almost, we're almost there
We are almost, we're almost there
We are almost, we're almost there
We are almost, we're almost there
