Don’t be afraid
We are a society
Built on love
Built on tolerance
Built on love
And each others acceptance
Give em love, give em love
Don’t matter what you look like
Don’t matter what you believe
But just believe in love
I’m talking to Philly
I’m talking to London
I’m talking to D.C
Paris, Berlin
And we gonna always be together
And we always give love
And we want you in
As long as you bring the love
Love love love love..
And we want you in
As long as you bring the love
We are free, we are love
We are big, we are small
We are a society y’all
And we want you in
As long as you bring the love
I’m talking to Philly
I’m talking to London
I’m talking to D.C
Paris, Berlin
And we gonna always be together
And we always give love
And we want you in
As long as you bring the love
Love love love love..
And we want you in
As long as you bring the love
