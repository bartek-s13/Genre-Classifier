Pleasure turns to the pain
Of the lessons learned from the strain
Of the questions burned in my brain about whether love is humane in its touch
These thoughts are like salmon swimming upstream in the tears of your deceit
Fighting a current hurt that kills more than is created by the chaos of our intertwined emotions
Chaotic because the anchor of Eros’ arrow has been plucked from the vessel of my undying infatuation
Separation not as simple as the distance between us
My mind no longer possessed by the demons that had been the overseers of my enslavement to your lies
The seeds of these lies rooted so deeply they’ve cracked the foundation of what we once shared
Allowing the faith in us I had sealed inside to gush out like a river
Ripping the image of our future together from my thoughts as violently and as brutally as if it were a child being taken from its mothers arms
I’m left surrounded in darkness, but I refuse to be swallowed by it
My loneliness like the night air; invisible to the eye, obvious to the touch, in its cold uncomfortableness
Yet If I could do all over again
I’d do it in the same skin I’m in
To lay down and let love die, just stay down and let love lie
No, no, no, no, not I
I’d rather stay 'round and let love fly
Even though I’ve seen its darkest form; deceit
Nothing else could taste this warm or feel this sweet
