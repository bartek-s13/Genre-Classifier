I woke up wondering
Questioning how'd this begin
How'd things get so out of place
Feels like we're keeping score
And every day it's like before
But we're both losing this game

There'll be times we fight
There'll be tears we cry
But it's just you and I on this road

So will you know when to hold me
And not let me be lonely
When I won't let you in
And sometimes when I'm angry
Will you know how to face me
Put me together again
And even when I need space
And don't mean the words that I say
Please don't go too far away
So when it feels like we're breaking
Will you know how to hate me
And love me again

I know there's a part of me
That handles things so stubbornly
When you don't see it my way
But you know we're both to blame
And pointing fingers every day
You know it's never going to change

There'll be times we fight
There'll be tears we cry
But it's just you and I on this road

So will you know when to hold me
And not let me be lonely
When I won't let you in
And sometimes when I'm angry
Will you know how to face me
Put me together again
And even when I need space
And don't mean the words that I say
Please don't go too far away
So when it feels like we're breaking
Will you know how to hate me
And love me again

Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah

So will you know when to hold me
And not let me be lonely
When I won't let you in
And sometimes when I'm angry
Will you know how to face me
Put me together again
And even when I need space
And don't mean the words that I say
Please don't go too far away
So when it feels like we're breaking
Will you know how to hate me
And love me again

So when it feels like we're breaking
Will you know how to hate me
And love me again
