When I met you it was nothing extra
Not from the same town but had all the same game
And I don't fall for it too often
So if you say you want it then you know where I am

Then that summertime in LA
Yeah, ever since you been sending shots my way
But you keep missin'
Don't give up on me yet
You down to risk it all?
You might just get it all

I got a thing for them fellas on the north side
If you wit' it like you telling, come and change my mind
You 100, quit frontin', hop on that 99 (Skrrt-skrrt, skrrt)
If you don't stop tryin', I might make you mine (Skrrt-skrrt, skrrt)
If you don't stop tryin', I might make you mine (Skrrt, skrrt-skrrt, skrrt)
If you don't stop tryin', I might make you mine

I don't know how serious you are
But all I know is if you want me you know where it's at
On the north side
If you're scared then you can go to church
But if you want it, you know where it's at
On the north side, yeah yeah

Then that summertime in LA
Yeah, ever since you been sending shots my way
But you keep missin'
Don't give up on me yet
You down to risk it all?
You might just get it all

I got a thing for them fellas on the north side
