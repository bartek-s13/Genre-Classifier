<<<<<<< HEAD
Hopefully I'll see you tonight
'Cause I made special effort for you
It's always, or maybe, or I might
No definite structure for us
But I decided, I decided

Hold on to your head
'Cause we're moving so far and so fast
Oh, can you hold on to your head?
'Cause we're moving so far and so fast

I used to believe in God
And I used to believe in me
But since I met you it seems
That all I believe in is disbelief

Hold on to your head
'Cause we're moving so far and so fast
Oh, can you hold on to your head?
'Cause we're moving so far and so fast

And I don't know what you want from me
I just thought that love was for free
And they'll say that I am naive
Well maybe I am, maybe I am

Hold on to your head
'Cause we're moving so far and so fast
Hold on to your head
'Cause we're moving so far and so fast

And hopefully I'll see you tonight
