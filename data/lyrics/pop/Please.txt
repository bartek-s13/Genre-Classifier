<<<<<<< HEAD
I think you heard me wrong, I hear your eyes
I think it came out wrong, a pillow of lies
Mmm

Oh, baby please, I'm on my needs
(Oh, my words are painful)
Oh, baby please, I'm on my needs
(Oh, my words seem hateful)
But we're building you and me
Don't cry that way

Ooh, no need to hold your head so low
Don't let that devil get you down
The words I used are way too strong, unstable
Come on, baby

Oh, baby please, I'm on my needs
(Oh, my words are painful)
Oh, baby please, I'm on my needs
(Oh, my words seem hateful)
But we're building you and me
Don't cry that way

I want to see your smile
I want to see your smile

Oh, baby please, I'm on my needs
(Oh, my words are painful)
Oh, baby please, I'm on my needs
(Oh, my words seem hateful)
But we're building you and me
Don't cry that way

Oh, your sighs

Keep me all of your
Keep me all of your
Keep me all of your (my sugarcane), taste of you
Keep me all of your, taste of you
Keep me all of your (all this pain on me), taste of you
Keep me all of your (all this pain on me), taste of you
Keep me all of your, taste of you
Keep me all of your (all this pain on me), taste of you
