Verse 1
We know what to do
When it comes to this
Feels so natural
Such a perfect fit
Don’t even think about it
Don’t even think about it

Verse 2
From across the room
I can feel your stare
And I know that soon
We’ll be leaving here
Don’t even think about it
Don’t even think about it
Pre
What do you want to hear
You’re not making sense
Cos it’s all the same
There’s no difference
Don’t even think about it
Don’t even think about it
Chorus
My my my my my my mouth
Can’t get these words to come out
I have got nothing to say
So why why why why do you stay
I know I know what you need
But this time you gotta believe
I gave you all that I can
Don’t talk about it and you’ll understand
My my my my my my mouth
Can’t get these words to come out
Verse 3
In this heart of mine
That you turned to stone
There’s no blood to find
Life has run it dry
Don’t want to lie to you now
Don’t want to lie to you now
Pre
What do you want from me
You’re not making sense
Cos we’re both the same
There’s no difference
Don’t want to lie to you now
Don’t want to lie to you now
Chorus
My my my my my my mouth
Can’t get these words to come out
I have got nothing to say
Why why why why do you stay
I know I know what you need
This time you gotta believe
I gave you all that I can
Don’t talk about it and you’ll understand
My my my my my my mouth
Can’t get these words to come out
Mid 8
You can hold me
But this loneliness
Binds me still
I’ll be sleeping
While you’re dreaming
Chorus
My my my my my my mouth
Can’t get these words to come out
I have got nothing to say
Why why why why do you stay
I know I know what you need
This time you gotta believe
I given you all that I can
Don’t talk about it and you’ll understand
My my my my my my mouth
Can’t get these words to come out
