I brought a dozen roses, you left a hundred thorns
I'm bleedin' out on the floor
It's kinda funny, ain't it? You always have to break shit
This could have been so much more

I don't need ya, I don't need ya
Ooh, you won't get the best of me
You won't get the best of me
I don't need ya, I don't need ya
Ooh, you won't get the best of me
It might sound crazy, but

Thank you for hurting me
This is the pain that I need
The inspiration to me
I said, I said, I said
Sometimes you gotta bleed
To know how good it can feel
When you finally heal
I said, I said, I said

I said, I said, I said
I said, I said, I said
