We got nothing to lo-o-o-o-ose
I know you're thinking it to-o-o-o-oo

We got everything
Smiles and sweet loving
But it seems like we got one piece missing
Talking through the night
Your eyes locked on mine
But it seems like we got one piece missing

I don't wanna play along
Acting like there's nothing wrong
Can't you see we only love when we got nothing on?
Looking at this photograph
Used to make each other laugh
Say goodbye to what we had

We got nothing to lo-o-o-o-ose
I know you're thinking it to-o-o-o-oo
No, we got nothing to lo-o-o-o-ose
'Cause I've been craving for somebody
We've been craving for somebody new
This show can't go on
Been on tour for too long
Let the curtains fall and say our goodbyes

I don't wanna play along
Acting like there's nothing wrong
Can't you see we only love when we got nothing on?
Looking at this photograph
Used to make each other laugh
Say goodbye to what we had

We got nothing to lo-o-o-o-ose
I know you're thinking it to-o-o-o-oo
No, we got nothing to lo-o-o-o-ose
'Cause I've been craving for somebody
We've been craving for somebody new

I know this is somthing that we need to do
But know that I'm still loving you
You gotta find another man
That can love you better than I can
We got nothing to lo-o-o-o-ose
I know you're thinking it to-o-o-o-oo
No, we got nothing to lo-o-o-o-ose
'Cause I've been craving for somebody
We've been craving for somebody new

We got nothing to lo-o-o-o-ose
I know you're thinking it to-o-o-o-oo
No, we got nothing to lo-o-o-o-ose
'Cause I've been craving for somebody
We've been craving for somebody new

We got nothing to lo-o-o-o-ose
'Cause I've been craving for somebody
