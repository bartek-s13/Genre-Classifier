Love coming at the back tonight
Looking at the window and what do I see
But in times just in case
Don’t fly on Wall Street

And you're on channel 2
Looking so amazing but they're not into you, and I

Second day I'm tired of waiting
I just wish I had more time, honey
I just feel like something different
Give me change I don’t want money
If your heart is spoken for
Zipped should don’t ask for more
If your heart is spoken for

Cause I'm chilling at the gymnasium
And you're on channel 2
Looking so amazing but they're not into you
Well I'm chilling at the gymnasium
And you're on channel 2

And they are looking for you, and I

I see you waiting
I see you waiting
You’re in the back of the car and looking over
I see you waiting
I see you waiting
And I just think that the time it's over

Cause I'm chilling at the gymnasium
And you're on channel 2
Looking so amazing but they're not into you
Well I'm chilling at the gymnasium
And you're on channel 2
Dodging in the distance
And they are looking for you, and I
