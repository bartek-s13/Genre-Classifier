D-D-Daytrip took it to ten (Hey)

Ayy, Panini, don't you be a meanie
Thought you wanted me to go up
Why you tryna keep me teeny? I
It's a dream, he wished it on a genie
I got fans finally, ain't you wanting them to see me? I

I thought you want this for my life, for my life
Said you wanted to see me thrive, you lied

Just say to me what you want from me
Just say to me what you want from me

Ayy, Panini, don't you be a meanie
Thought you wanted me to go up
Why you tryna keep me teeny now?
Now they need me, number one on streaming
Oh yeah, you used to love me
So what happened, what's the meaning? I
I thought you want this for my life, for my life
Said you wanted to see me thrive, you lied

Now when it's all done, I get the upper hand
I need a big Benz, not another fan
But I still want you as a fan
I'ma need to sit down, don't mean to make demands
But I need you to...

Say to me what you want from me
Just say to me what you want from me
