<<<<<<< HEAD
I never want to fight, but we do it all the time
Just know I feel the same
Five thousand miles between, each day feels like a week
And that's all we have to blame

You know I leave a light on for you in the night
I hear your heartbeat so deep every time I cry

But if you need somebody, you just have to say my name
I'll be running back to you
You know I'd walk the ocean just so I could see your face
I'll be running back to you
Running right back to you

I try and stay awake so I can hear you say
Good morning and good night
But lately we're so tired, we're always crossing wires
Don't you forget you're mine

You know I leave a light on for you in the night
I hear your heartbeat so deep every time I cry
But if you need somebody, you just have to say my name
I'll be running back to you
You know I'd walk the ocean just so I could see your face
I'll be running back to you
Running right back to you
Running right back to you
Running back to you (running back to you)
Running right back to you
Running right back to you
Running back to you (running back to you)

You know I leave a light on for you in the night
I hear your heartbeat so deep every time I cry

But if you need somebody, you just have to say my name
I'll be running back to you
You know I'd walk the ocean just so I could see your face
I'll be running back to you
But if you need somebody, you just have to say my name
I'll be running back to you
You know I'd walk the ocean just so I could see your face
I'll be running back to you
Running right back to you (I keep on running)
Running right back to you (I keep on running)
Running back to you (I keep on running back to you)
Running right back to you (I keep on running)
Running right back to you (I keep on running)
Running back to you (I keep on running back to you)
Running right back to you (I keep on running)
Running right back to you (I keep on running)
Running back to you (I keep on running back to you)
Running right back to you (I keep on running)
Running right back to you (I keep on running)
