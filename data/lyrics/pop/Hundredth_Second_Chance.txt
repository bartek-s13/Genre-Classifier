I think I've had enough of you
I don't have time for you
I don't want to see this through
Had it with the things you do
I think I've had enough of you

Thumbs through belt loops
I hardly felt you
We were kissing
Something was missing
And, no room for tears shed
Inside our twin bed
Darling you're a mess;
Goes good with your dress

They should name a hurricane after her
But a dance in the rain's what I prefer
Caught in the eye
Of her eyes
They should name a hurricane after her
But a dance in the rain's what I prefer
Caught in the eye

I think I've had enough of you
I don't have time for you
I don't want to see this through
Had it with the things you do
I think I've had enough of you
I don't have time for you
I don't want to see this through
But maybe, just maybe
One more dance
Little bit of romance
Go ahead and take my hand
A hundredth second chance
One more dance
Little bit of romance
Go ahead and take my hand
A hundredth second chance
I don't have time for you
I don't want to see this through
Had it with the things you do
I think I've had enough of you

Broken in places
One for the ages
Taken hotel room
Vacant without you
And, sleep in the basement
None of this makes sense
All things considered
I couldn't quit her

They should name a hurricane after her
But a dance in the rain's what I prefer
Caught in the eye
Of her eyes
They should name a hurricane after her
But a dance in the rain's what I prefer
Caught in the eye

I think I've had enough of you
I don't have time for you
I don't want to see this through
Had it with the things you do
I think I've had enough of you
I don't have time for you
I don't want to see this through
But maybe, just maybe
One more dance
Little bit of romance
Go ahead and take my hand
A hundredth second chance
One more dance
Little bit of romance
Go ahead and take my hand
A hundredth second chance

But maybe, just maybe
One more dance
Little bit of romance
Go ahead and take my hand
A hundredth second chance
One more dance
Little bit of romance
Go ahead and take my hand
A hundredth second chance
I think I've had enough of you
I don't have time for you
I don't want to see this through
Had it with the things you do
I think I've had enough of you
I don't have time for you
I don't want to see this through

Yeah, I think I've had enough of you
I don't have time for you
I don't want to see this through
Had it with the things you do
I think I've had enough of you
I don't have time for you
I don't want to see this through
But maybe, just maybe
One more dance
Little bit of romance
Go ahead and take my hand
A hundredth second chance
One more dance
Little bit of romance
Go ahead and take my hand
A hundredth second chance
