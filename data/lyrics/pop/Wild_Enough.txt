To your palette
I'm translucent
At least when I am looking at myself
You're that coltsfoot
Breaking pavement
All I seem to do is break these things

I might be a faded polaroid
Tryna be something that I have never been

If I was dancing on the tables
Buying rounds 'til the dawn
Is that wild enough, wild enough, wild enough for you?
Talking dirty in the bedroom
Be the one to start a fight
Would that be wild enough, wild enough for you?
Am I wild enough, wild enough for you?
Am I wild enough, wild enough for you?

To your major
I'm minor
Breaking every single chord you play
I'm sweet wine but you want whiskey
And I just wish I could be strong enough
Still a faded polaroid
But I can't be something that I have never been

If I was dancing on the tables
Buying rounds 'til the dawn
Is that wild enough, wild enough, wild enough for you?
Talking dirty in the bedroom
Be the one to start a fight
Would that be wild enough, wild enough for you?
Am I wild enough, wild enough for you?
Am I wild enough, wild enough for you?

Yeah I bet you fantasize about somebody else
Someone that would fulfil your needs
But I bet it's never been this good with anyone else
There is so much you haven't seen in me

If I was dancing on the tables
Buying rounds 'til the dawn
Is that wild enough, wild enough, wild enough for you?
Talking dirty in the bedroom
Be the one to start a fight
Would that be wild enough, wild enough for you?
Am I wild enough, wild enough for you?
Am I wild enough, wild enough for you?
