Standing on the platform, watching you go
It's like no other pain I've ever known
To love someone so much, to have no control
You said, "I wanna see the world" and I said, "Go"

But I think I'm lost without you
I just feel crushed without you
'Cause I've been strong for so long
I never thought how much I needed you
I think I'm lost without you

Strangers rushing past, just tryna get home
You were the only safe haven that I've known
Hits me at full speed, feel like I can't breathe
And nobody knows this pain inside me
My world is crumbling, I should never have let you go

I think I'm lost without you
I think I'm lost, lost, lost
Ooh-way, ooh-way, ooh-way, ooh-way, ooh, ooh
I think I'm lost without you, you
I just feel crushed without you
And I've been strong for so long
But I never thought how much I love you
Standing on the platform, watching you go
