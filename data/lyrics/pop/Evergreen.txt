I kissed my penny and I threw it in
I prayed I'd keep my soul
Went down to the river where the water bends
The only place I know

Oh, I can't see
The forest
For the trees

So will you wait for me?
Will you wait for me?
Will you wait for me?
My evergreen

Standing at the water's edge
The Mississippi's overflowing
Hold your current in my hands
You bring the meaning to my moments

Oh, I can't see
The forest
For the trees

So will you wait for me?
Will you wait for me?
Will you wait for me?
My evergreen

Oh, I can't see
The forest
For the trees
Oh, I feel so
Hopeless against the stream

So will you wait for me?
My evergreen
I know it's just as hard in Heaven
So will you wait for me?
My evergreen
I know it's just as hard
My evergreen
