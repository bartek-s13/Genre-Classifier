Baby, I've been drifting away
Dreaming all day
Of holding you
Touching you
The only thing I wanna do
Is be with you
As close to you
As I can be

Let's make love
All night long
Until all our strength is gone
Hold on tight
Just let go
I wanna feel you in my soul
Until the sun comes up
Let's make love
Oh, baby

Do you know what you do to me?
Everything inside of me
Is wanting you
And needing you
I'm so in love with you
Look in my eyes
Let's get lost tonight
In each other

Let's make love
All night long
Until all our strength is gone
Hold on tight
Just let go
I wanna feel you in my soul
Until the sun comes up
Let's make love
Oh, baby


Let's make love
All night long
Until all our strength is gone
Hold on tight
Just let go
I wanna feel you in my soul
Until the sun comes up
Oh, until the sun comes up
Let's make love
Oh, baby

Oh baby, let's make love
All night long
All night long
Let's make love
