Can't see the stars, but we're reaching
Trying to get through the dark on a feeling
Lost our gravity, now we’re weightless
But I know in my heart we can take this

We got monsters in our closets
Had a reason but we lost it
No direction, we've been calling through the night
Through the night

If love is a lie, then why do we need it?
We swear we're alive, but we're falling to pieces
We fight like lions
We howl at the moon
We should be flying
Instead we bury the truth
But I know inside we're beautiful creatures (beautiful)

We're beautiful creatures

When your highs are low, keep the faith yeah
Cause you know that a life's never wasted
Standing tall, shaking off the dust
Now we know, now we know what we're made of

We got monsters in our closets
Had a reason but we lost it
No direction, we've been calling through the night
Through the night

If love is a lie, then why do we need it?
We swear we're alive, but we're falling to pieces
We fight like lions
We howl at the moon
We should be flying
Instead we bury the truth
But I know inside we're beautiful creatures

We're beautiful creatures (beautiful)
We're beautiful creatures
