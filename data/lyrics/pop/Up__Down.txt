They just want your head
Moving up &amp; down
Up &amp; down
Up &amp; down
They got inside your head
Flip it upside down
Upside down
Upside down
We can feel an order
Getting in our way
We don't need the rule of yesterday
Breaking down the borders
Tearing down the sides
Hear this one last time
They just want your head
Moving up &amp; down
Up &amp; down
Up &amp; down
They got inside your head
Flip it upside down
Upside down
Upside down
They just want your head
Moving up &amp; down
Up &amp; down
Up &amp; down
They got inside your head
Flip it upside down
Upside down
Upside down
Up, up &amp; down
Up, up &amp; down
Up, up &amp; down
Up, up &amp; down
Up, up &amp; down
Up, up &amp; down
Up, up &amp; down
Up &amp; down
They just want your head
Moving up &amp; down
Up &amp; down
Up &amp; down
They got inside your head
Flip it upside down
Upside down
Upside down
We can feel an order
Getting in our way
We don't need the rule of yesterday
Breaking down the borders
Tearing down the sides
Hear this one last time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time...
They just want your head
Moving up &amp; down
Up &amp; down
Up &amp; down
They got inside your head
Flip it upside down
Upside down
Up &amp; down
They just want your head
Moving up &amp; down

Up &amp; down
They got inside your head
Flip it upside down

We can feel an order
Getting in our way
We don't need the rule of yesterday
