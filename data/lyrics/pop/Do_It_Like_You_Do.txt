You're so old and shine on me darling
Your new skies all turn to dusk

And soon, maybe I'll see them too
Miles apart we share the same moon

And so long, coast to coast
Over the dark ocean, where you're ready to go
When you, just like a ghost
Till the summertime comes and goes

Just do it like you do
Just let me know, oh let me know
And do
Just do it like, oh do it like you do

And this new time may turn on us
But soon enough we'll overcome

And so long, coast to coast
Over the dark ocean, where you're ready to go
When you, just like a ghost
Till the summertime comes and goes
Just do it like you do
Just let me know, oh let me know
And do
Just do it like, oh do it like you do
And do (Do it like you do)
Just let me know, oh let me know (Do it like you do)
And do (Do it like you do)
Just do it like, oh do it like you do

And don't worry, no
You will be magical
But still, you'll feel like you're home
Dear, you will be on your way
Don't worry, no
You will be magical
But still, you'll feel like you're home
Dear, you will be on your way
Don't worry, no
You will be magical
But still, you'll feel like you're home
Dear, you will be on your way

So do it like you do
Just let me know, oh let me know
And do
Just do it like, oh do it like you do
Giving it up for, good to be home soon
(Just do it like you do)
Live with the same sun, sleep with the same moon
(Just do it like you do)
Giving it up for, good to be home soon
(Do it like you do)
Live with the same sun, sleep with the same moon
(Ooh)
