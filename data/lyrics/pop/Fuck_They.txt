I don't give a fuck about they
I don't give a fuck about they

Oh they, put me out, thin me down, tire me slowly
After that, after they, nothing is holy
Play the freak, pray for weeks, smooth out my body
'Cause after all

Deep down in the world, on this rock we got
All these rules that everyone keep makin' up
Who the fuck is they? I wanna meet with them
I wanna be real nice, I wanna be their friend
We gonna get real close, we gonna laugh all night
We gonna have a moment, then we say goodbye

I don't give a fuck about they

I don't give a fuck about they (Who's they?)
Who gives a fuck about they? (Who's they?)
I don't give a fuck (They don't even give a)
They don't even give a fuck (Who's they anyway?)
I don't give a fuck about they (Who's they?)
Who gives a fuck about they? (Who's they?)
I don't give a fuck (They don't even give a)
They don't even give a fuck
Oh my, what a time, what a vibe and we are hardly
Hardly beginning, oh, this party
We got us, we got they, we got an army
Oh, 'cause we know

Deep down in the world, on this rock, we got
All these rules that everyone keep makin' up
Who the fuck is they? I wanna meet with them
I wanna be real nice, I wanna be their friend
We gonna get real close, we gonna laugh all night
We gonna have a moment then we say goodbye...
