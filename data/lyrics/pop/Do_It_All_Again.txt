‘85, something wrong
Mommy crying, daddy gone
Was it me, nose bleeds
Empty fridge, no groceries
Teardrops running down my face
It’s just one of those days
If you and me would meet someday
I think the first thing you would say is something like
I’ve made some mistakes in the past
But something that is cannot change
I've tried to do the best that I can to wish it all away but
I would do it all again
I would do it all again, yeah
I would do it all again
And again, and again
’99, flashing lights, don’t move hands up to the sky
What should I do, Just run away
The pistol is on me, but it’s not mine I say
It’s like it’s all falling out of place
But I see it much clearer now
I see it much clearer now
So much clearer now
I’ve made some mistakes in the past
But something that is cannot change
I've tried to do the best that I can to wish it all away but
I would do it all again
I would do it all again, yeah
I would do it all again
And again, and again
