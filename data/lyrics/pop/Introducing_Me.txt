<<<<<<< HEAD
I'm, I'm good at wasting time
I think lyrics need to rhyme
And you're not asking
But I'm trying to grow a mustache
I eat cheese, but only on pizza please
And sometimes on a homemade quesadilla
Otherwise it smells like feet to me, and I
I really like it when the moon looks like a toenail
And I love you when you say my name

If you wanna know, here it goes:
Gonna tell ya there's a part of me that shows if were close
Gonna let you see everything
But remember that you asked for it
I'm trying to do my best to impress
But it's easier to let ya take a guess at the rest
But you wanna hear what lives in my brain
And my heart, well, you asked for it
For your perusing, at times confusing, slightly amusing
Introducing me

Doo-doo, doo-doo-do-doo-doo
Doo-doo, doo-doo-do-doo-doo
La-da-da-daa
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, da
I never, trust a dog to watch my food
And I like to use the word dude
As a noun, or an adverb, or an adjective, and I
I've never really been into cars
I like really cool guitars and superheroes
And checks with lots of zeros on 'em
I love the sound of violins and making someone smile

If you wanna know, here it goes:
Gonna tell ya there's a part of me that shows if were close
Gonna let you see everything

I'm trying to do my best to impress

But you wanna hear what lives in my brain
And my heart, well, you asked for it
For your perusing, at times confusing, possibly amusing
Introducing me

Well, you probably know more than you ever wanted to
So be careful when you ask next time

So if you wanna know, here it goes:
