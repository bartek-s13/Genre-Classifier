<<<<<<< HEAD
I heard lots of things
You were all that I believe
Promise that you'll take me home
Say your home is next to me

I been tryna hide, I been tryna hide
Find a place that's far away and stay a couple nights
I been getting high, I been getting high
Told myself I wouldn't but I guess I told a lie
I live in the sky, I live in the sky
Everybody's laughing when I tell 'em what it's like
I been getting high, I been getting high
Told myself I wouldn't but I'm talking when I shouldn't and

I heard lots of things
You were all that I believe
Promise that you'll take me home
Say your home is next to me

Born inside a star, shooting at my room
Throwing stones at window panes was just a bit too cool
I've been trying to hide, I've been on the move
UFOs could take me home, I'm missing my old room
I've been trying to find, I've been trying to find
That memory inside my head from back when I was nine
I've been on my grind, I've been on my grind
Et cetera, I'm better-er than I've been in some time
I heard lots of things
You were all that I believe
Promise that you'll take me home
Say your home is next to me
I heard lots of things
You were all that I believe
Promise that you'll take me home
Say your home is next to me

Yeah, I got you if you didn't notice
Always falling for the Insta photos
You think I'm shallow, no swimming over
Later that night, no melanomas, can't really focus
Got lights from the space craft pointed in my face like a ray gun
Or a quasar far away from where we started
I guessed that's what we aimed for
We're making memories this year
These are the important moments
We could be legendary next year, like before we know it
And it felt hopeless back then, but we we were always glowing
In the dark, that's Oreo-in', mulling four leaf clovers
Of course we're smoking until the worm holes all close in

UFOs could take me home, I'm missing my old room
UFOs could take me home, I'm missing my old room
UFOs could take me home, I'm missing my old room
UFOs could take me home, I'm missing my old room
UFOs could take me home, I'm missing my old room
UFOs could take me home, I'm missing my old room
UFOs could take me home, I'm missing my old room
