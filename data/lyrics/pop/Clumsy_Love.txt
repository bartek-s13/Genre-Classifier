If you could ever love me half as much as you could love yourself
We’d have a big house and a big old tree for us and no one else

What’s hiding behind those sad eyes? Don’t start with those lies
I can only love you twice as much before you fuck this up

You're clumsy, oh love, you keep me hanging on
Am I not enough? Don’t keep me hanging on
I’ve got to be strong, tell me I’m the only one
You're clumsy, oh love, is she ever gonna go away
Is she ever gonna go away,  is she ever gonna go away
Never going away, never going away (hey!)
Never going away, never going away (hey!)

Suns in the sky, it’s hard to see when the clouds keep moving in
Sleep through the day, walk through the night
I don’t know where to begin

Where were you when I called, don’t start with those lies
I can only love you twice as much before you fuck this up
You're clumsy, oh love, you keep me hanging on
Am I not enough? Don’t keep me hanging on
I’ve got to be strong, tell me I’m the only one
You're clumsy, oh love, is she ever gonna go away
Never going away, never going away (hey!)
Never going away, never going away (hey!)
You're clumsy, oh love, is she ever gonna go away
Never going away, never going away (hey!)
Never going away, never going away (hey!)

You're clumsy, oh love, you keep me hanging on
Am I not enough? Don’t keep me hanging on
I’ve got to be strong, tell me I’m the only one
You're clumsy, oh love, is she ever gonna go away
Is she ever gonna go away
Never going away, never going away (hey!)
Never going away, never going away (hey!)
Is she ever gonna go away
Never going away, never going away (hey!)
Never going away, never going away (hey!)
Is she ever gonna go away
