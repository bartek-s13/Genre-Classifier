Another night in my new skin
Throw emotion to the wind
And just try to find a face that makes me feel something
And for all the pretty mouths
And pretty words that turn me out
I just end up at your house
20,000 leagues beneath the ocean
I've been trying to keep my distance
(I still need you, I still need you)
So hard to keep my distance
(I still need you, I still need you)
And you make me want to stay
Cause you look so good
But I know you babe, and this can't wait
Not one more touch
One more drink
One more minute
One more night

So I surrender
This is the moment I surrender
Now all the shapes I know are gone
The charts and maps I've drawn just get me lost
And I'm falling off the edge
And you make me want to change
With the look on your face
Cause I miss you babe, but I can't stay
Not one more kiss
Not one more fix
Not one more minute
One more night

So I surrender
This is the moment I surrender
Even now, let it in
Oh Lord I surrender
I been trying to keep my distance
So hard to keep my distance
I still need you
But I, I can’t stay
Heart still beating
Heart still the same
Send me back in time
Break me again
I still need you
I still need you
When I speak will you listen?
So send me back a thousand days
That first night at your old place
And tell me how it ends
I'd do it all again
For one more minute
One more night
If all that I could ever be was the best ex-lover of your life
If all that I could ever be was the best ex-lover of your life
So I surrender
This is the moment I surrender
Even now, let it in
Oh Lord I surrender
And all that I could ever be was the best ex-lover of your life
And all that I could ever be was the best ex-lover of your life
Keep my distance
Still trying to keep my distance
