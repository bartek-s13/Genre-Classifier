How can you tell me "I know this is hard"?
Bringing you out but there barely (?)
Rolling around, conversational thoughts
Present or past, so well where do we start?

And I (I) can't help it all the times
I've felt better, lost to this weather
And I (I) can't shelve it, tell me
I have to feel better, ignore all this weather
And I (I) can't help it all the times
I've felt better, lost to this weather
It's why (I) can't see you all the time
All the time

(?) will call in before it breaks dawn
AM to PM, I don't know what's on
Talked to you for hours, in only six songs
Present or past, wait, it's always this long

And I (I) can't help it all the times
I've felt better, lost to this weather
And I (I) can't shelve it, tell me
I have to feel better, ignore all this weather
And I (I) can't help it all the times
I've felt better, lost to this weather
It's why (I) can't see you all the time, time, time, time

(Aaahhhhhh)
(Aaahhhhhh)
(Aaahhhhhh)

And I (I) can't help it all the times
I've felt better, lost to this weather
And I (I) can't shelve it, tell me
I have to feel better, ignore all this weather
And I (I) can't help it all the times
I've felt better, lost to this weather
It's why (I) can't see you all the time
