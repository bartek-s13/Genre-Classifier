Smoking cigarettes on the roof
You look so pretty and I love this view

We fell in love in October
That's why, I love fall
Looking at the stars
Admiring from afar

My girl, my girl, my girl
You will be my girl
My girl, my girl, my girl
You will be my world
My world, my world, my world
You will be my girl

Smoking cigarettes on the roof
You look so pretty and I love this view
Don't bother looking down
We're not going that way
At least I know, I am here to stay

We fell in love in October
That's why, I love fall
Looking at the stars
Admiring from afar
(My girl, my girl, my girl)

My girl, my girl, my girl
You will be my girl
My girl, my girl, my girl
You will be my girl
My girl, my girl, my girl
You will be my girl
My girl, my girl, my girl
You will be my world
My world, my world, my world
