I saw you this time for real
I know that this is not a dream, no
I can see myself looking like an angel
This can't be true I'm in denial
I've been dead all along
I thought that I was wrong
When I saw you
But now I know it's true
This time, this time it's for real, oh
This time, this time I can feel you
(Feel you, feel you, feel you, feel you...)
