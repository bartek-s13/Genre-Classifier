Wish that I could trust my own eyes
Shouldn't need someone to tell me I'm alright
Everything looks good from outside
Come a little closer, that's when we all find

How many friends do we really have
If they're never there when it all goes down?
They ain't gonna care, they ain't gonna last
I could waste away my whole life

Always looking for the wrong kind of people
To show me the way
Always searching for somebody to tell me
I'm doing okay
Getting wasted on the height of their ego
Think it's time I start to take care of me, though
I was looking for the wrong kind of people
To show me the way

Everybody makes those mistakes
Looking in the mirror can be so cruel these days
That's we have to learn the way
Forget to know the worst thing you and I can all change

How many friends do we really have
If they're never there when it all goes down?
They ain't gonna care, they ain't gonna last
I could waste away my whole life

Always looking for the wrong kind of people
To show me the way
Always searching for somebody to tell me
I'm doing okay
Getting wasted on the height of their ego
Think it's time I start to take care of me, though
I was looking for the wrong kind of people
To show me the way

I lost my mind tryna always, be right but I went the wrong way
I lost my mind 'cause I kept losing sight that we're all just the same

Always looking for the wrong kind of people
To show me the way
Always searching for somebody to tell me
I'm doing okay
Getting wasted on the height of their ego
Think it's time I start to take care of me, though
I was looking for the wrong kind of people
To show me the way
