I gave you ride or die  and you gave me games, love
Figures
I know I'm crying 'cause you just won't change, love
Figures
I gave it all and you gave me shit, love
Figures
I wish I could do exactly what you did

I wish I could hurt you back
Love, what would you do if you couldn't get me back?
You're the one who's gonna lose
Something so special, something so real
Tell me, boy, how in the fuck would you feel?
If you couldn't get me back
That's what I wish that I could do
To you, you, hoo, hoo (Yeah)
To you, you, hoo, hoo (Yeah)

Figures
I'm the bad guy 'cause I can't learn to trust, love
Figures
You say sorry once and you think it's enough
I got a lineup of girls and a lineup of guys
Begging for me just to give 'em a try
Figures
I'm willing to stay 'cause I'm sick for your love
Wish I could hurt you back
Love, what would you do if you couldn't get me back?
You're the one who's gonna lose
Something so special, something so real
Tell me, boy, how in the fuck would you feel?
If you couldn't get me back
That's what I wish that I could do
To you, you, hoo, hoo (Yeah)
To you, you, hoo, hoo (Yeah)
