Hit the ground
Hit the ground running

It's a one way street with an open end
And you never know what lies ahead
But I always knew that this was it
The signs were lit, oh, I always knew

I'm gonna hit the ground running, hit the ground running
Only waited for the marching drums
I'll be ready when the moment comes
I'm gonna hit the ground running, hit the ground running
Only waited for the marching drums
I'll be ready when the moment comes

I'm an overdrive, gonna play offense
And I won't look back, there'll be no regrets
I'll keep my head up, even if I'm fed up
'Cause I'm getting closer, oh, I know, oh, I know

I'm gonna hit the ground running, hit the ground running
Only waited for the marching drums
I'll be ready when the moment comes
I'm gonna hit the ground running, hit the ground running
Only waited for the marching drums
I'll be ready when the moment comes

I'll be ready when the moment comes
Only waited for the marching drums
I'll be ready when the moment comes

It's a one way street with an open end
And you never know what lies ahead
But I always knew that this was it
The signs were lit, oh, I always knew

I'm gonna hit the ground running, hit the ground running
Only waited for the marching drums
I'll be ready when the moment comes
I'm gonna hit the ground running, hit the ground running
Only waited for the marching drums
I'll be ready when the moment comes
I'm gonna hit the ground running, hit the ground running
Only waited for the marching drums
I'll be ready when the moment comes
I'm gonna hit the ground running, hit the ground running
Only waited for the marching drums
I'll be ready when the moment comes
