Oh, no
See you walking 'round like it's a funeral
Not so serious girl, why those feet cold?

Waste time with a masterpiece, don't waste time with a masterpiece (Huh)
You should be rollin' with me, you should be rollin' with me (Ahh)

But you're movin' so carefully, let's start livin' dangerously

Want another taste, I'm begging, yes ma'am
I'm tired of all this candy on the dry land, dry land, ooh

Waste time with a masterpiece
Don't waste time with a masterpiece (Huh)
You should be rollin' me, you should be rollin' me (Ahh)
