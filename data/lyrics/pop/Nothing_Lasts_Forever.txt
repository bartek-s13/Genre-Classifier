Every kiss that I gave in the dark
You and I made so many scars
And I tatoo your name on my arm
Cause you know that I love you hard

You'll open up your eyes one day
All of me will fade away
Open up your eyes I'll fade away, fade away 'cause

Nothing lasts forever with me
Nothing lasts forever with me
And I try, and I thought, we'd be different
And I try, and I thought, we could get it but
Nothing (Nothing)
Oh, nothing lasts forever with me
[Verse 2}
And it's always a shot in the dark
I think I knew it from the start
But you told me the world was ours
And I swear that I loved you hard
Now's the part I walk away
You wonder how I fade away
Now's the part I fade, I fade away, fade away 'cause

Nothing lasts forever with me
Nothing lasts forever with me
And I try, and I thought, we'd be different
And I try, and I thought, we could get it but
Nothing (Nothing)
Oh, nothing lasts forever with me

And I try, and I thought, we'd be different
And I try, and I thought, we could get it
And I try, and I thought, we could get it but

Nothing lasts forever with me
Nothing lasts forever with me
And I try, and I thought, we'd be different
And I try, and I thought, we could get it but
Nothing (Nothing)
Oh, nothing lasts forever with me
