Pain, don't go
You remind me of a winter storm
Faith, don't grow
When they say you've been sore
If I stay, if I stay, don't go
If I stay, if I stay, don't go
Pain, don't go
You remind me of a summer storm
Faith, don't grow
When they say you've been sore
If I stay, if I stay, don't go
If I stay, if I stay, don't go
Don't go, go, go
Oh, don't go, go, go
Pain, don't go

Pain, don't go
You remind me of a winter storm
Faith, don't grow
When they say you've been sore
If I stay, if I stay, don't go
If I stay, if I stay, don't go
Pain, don't go
You remind me of a summer storm
Faith, don't grow
When they say you've been sore
If I stay, if I stay, don't go
If I stay, if I stay, don't go
Don't go, go, go
Oh, don't go, go, go
Pain, don't go
