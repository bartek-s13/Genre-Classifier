Something in the water
I hear people talking
I hear what they say, uh
It's got me caught up
I've been drowning for days

I knew when I saw ya
Heading for trouble
But I like the game, yeah
It's got us tied up
Caught in the rain

I've been losing sleep, over empty sheets
I know you're doing it too
We could talk all night, 'til the morning light
But you always leave too soon

And if we both know what we want
Then why do we wait, why do we wait?
And if we both know where this goes
Then why, why do we hesitate?
Why do we
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
Why, why do we hesitate?
I've been losing sleep, over empty sheets
I know you're doing it too
We could talk all night, 'til the morning light
But you always leave too soon, oh

Why do we wait?
And if we both know where this goes
Then why, why do we hesitate?
Why do we
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
Why, why do we hesitate?
Why do we
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
Why, why do we hesitate?
