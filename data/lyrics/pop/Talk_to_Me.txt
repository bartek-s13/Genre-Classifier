Uptown, don't know my up from down
Haunted by the soft sound of your voice
Watching, stealing glances, falling
Body language calling, out my name

On and on, I can't escape it

When the lights are fading
And he's not coming home
Talk to me, talk to me
Talk to me, talk to me
If you need somebody
And you're feeling all alone
Talk to me, talk to me
Talk to me, talk to me

Classic, touch is so electric
Hooked just like an addict, I can't leave
Tragic, I know we could have it
Baby, just imagine you and me

On and on, I can't escape it
When the lights are fading
And he's not coming home
Talk to me, talk to me
Talk to me, talk to me
If you need somebody
And you're feeling all alone
Talk to me, talk to me
Talk to me, talk to me

On and on
On and on, I can't escape it

When the lights are fading
And he's not coming home
Talk to me, talk to me
Talk to me, talk to me
If you need somebody
And you're feeling all alone
Talk to me, talk to me
Talk to me, talk to me

Talk to me, talk to me
Talk to me, talk to me
Talk to me, talk to me
Talk to me, talk to me
