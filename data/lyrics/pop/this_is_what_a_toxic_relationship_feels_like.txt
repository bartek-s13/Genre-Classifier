Stone cold, where have you been?
On hold, where are my things?

And I’ve been looking for a way out of here
As my soul begins to disappear
And all you ever do is bring out my fears
Oh, I understand why you’re not need so

What I hope for you to be
And what I deserve is more than just your insecurity
That energy is what’ll bring out the worst in me
Me, me

I'm so tired of reminiscing what we used to be
And why do I think I can change you
When all you ever say is
Why can’t things just stay the same?
You’re pulling me under, straight from another part of me
I thought I'd never leave to you
What do I do, now?

And though I really need to get out of here
Because my soul starting to disappear
And all you ever do is bring out my fears
Oh, I understand why you’re not need so

What I hope for you to be
And what I deserve is more than just your insecurity
That energy is what’ll bring out the worst in me
Me, me

So what and I hope for you to be
And what I deserve is more than just your insecurity
That energy is what’ll bring out the worst in me
Me, me
