There's no need to lie to me baby
Tryna get cute and sly with me baby
Spin a web of "yeah, right"s for me baby
As if I care
There's no need to toy with me baby
Tryna play it all coy with me baby
Think you're going all "boy" on me baby
As if I care
Cause I'm just gonna let you down
Yeah I'mma be the one to burn this out
You think you can affect my heart
Oh baby you'd be wishing on a star
Cause I can give as good as I get, you'll see
Boy you ain't got me just yet, guarantee
(Boy you ain't got me just yet, guarantee)

Think you're going all "boy" on me baby
As if I care
As if I care
As if I care
Cause we don't need to jump the gun
It's not as if you think that I'm the one
So what's the point in playing cute
When we'll be on a somebody out soon
Oh don't waste your time tryna figure me out
When all I'm good for is fucking around
(When all I'm good for is fucking around)
