Through the years I have learned
Try to conquering my world
I앐 sitting on a fortune
And falling in love
Love압 the meaning now and you
Are the one who made it true
And my blood seems obviously
E-oh a haunting melody
I try to forget
You know memories
I앐 still on the run
I앐 begging on my knees
Will I ever learn
How to catch control?
Will I ever know?
You go into my soul
OOhuuhOoohuuuOo
Your friends are gotta know
Your fucked up by yourself
OOhuuhOoohuuuOo
They leave you all alone
And now youre on your own
Through the years I have learned
Try to conquering my world
I앐 sitting on a fortune
And falling in love
Love압 the meaning now and you
Are the one who made it true
And my blood seems obviously
E-oh a haunting melody
I try to forget
You know memories
I앐 still on the run
I앐 begging on my knees
Will I ever learn
How to catch control?
Will I ever know?
You go into my soul
OOhuuhOoohuuuOo
Your friends are gotta know
Your fucked up by yourself
OOhuuhOoohuuuOo
They leave you all alone
