Through the years I have learned
Try to conquering my world
I´m sitting on a fortune
And falling in love
Love´s the meaning now and you
Are the one who made it true
And my blood seems obviously
E-oh a haunting melody
I try to forget
You know memories
I´m still on the run
I´m begging on my knees
Will I ever learn
How to catch control?
Will I ever know?
You go into my soul
OOhuuhOoohuuuOo
Your friends are gotta know
Your fucked up by yourself
OOhuuhOoohuuuOo
They leave you all alone
And now you´re on your own
