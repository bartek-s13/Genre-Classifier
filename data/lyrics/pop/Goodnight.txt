I took comfort in her sweetness
Her love yeah that was my weakness
When the fields sleep
When the wind dies
I remember you best
I fed off her flame contagious
They couldn’t hold us down in cages
When the fields sleep
When the wind dies
I remember you best

I don’t know when ill see you babe
But I’m gonna keep my faith
Its been years since i felt your touch
But I’m never gonna give up
See you in the clouds again
Telling myself this ain't the end

Since you left my body went numb
Like I'm swimming in robitussin
In the purple
In the meadow
I remember you best
Maybe this world wasn’t for us
Maybe we didn’t give enough
In the purple
In the meadow
I remember you best
I don’t know when ill see you babe
But I’m gonna keep my faith
Its been years since i felt your touch
But I’m never gonna give up
Will meet again in northern lights
For now we have to say goodnight
