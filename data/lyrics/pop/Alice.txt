Oh Alice, I can't continue this way
Oh Alice, faking smiles since you've been away
Alice, tell me, what is his name?
Oh Alice, breaking hearts 'cause no one's the same

The night we broke, you told me I wasn't enough
I had to throw my memories on the shelf
You told me you didn't need any of me
So I took a plane just to help myself

Oh Alice, I can't continue this way
Oh Alice, faking smiles since you've been away
Alice, tell me, what is his name?
Oh Alice, breaking hearts 'cause no one's the same

I've changed my ways, I'm so different now
A second chance seems like it would work somehow
You told me you didn't need any of me
I'm asking you, please just hear me out

Oh Alice, I can't continue this way
Oh Alice, faking smiles since you've been away
Alice, tell me, what is his name?
Oh Alice, breaking hearts 'cause no one's the same

Trying not to let go
Shadowing my echoes (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Trying not to let go
Why can't this be simple? (Oh-oh-oh-oh)

Oh Alice, I can't continue this way
Oh Alice, faking smiles since you've been away
Alice, tell me, what is his name?
Oh Alice, breaking hearts 'cause no one's the same
