Last time, we were in it, in it
Translating our feelings within
Now we're right back in it, in it
All I, all I can say is

Hold me back, tell me something
Something that will bring me closer to you
Had enough, fall back in
Falling for the thing that brought me

Love, our love, our love can't make it now
Can't we, can't we, can't save it now
Our love, our love, won't make it now
No one really wins this time
No one really wins this time around
No one really wins this time
Nobody

Last time, we were in it, in it
We had, we had nothing in between us
Now we're right down in it, in it
Million different reasons you should hold me
Hold me back, tell me something
Something that will bring me closer to you
Had enough, fall back in
Falling for the thing that brought me

Love, our love, our love can't make it now
Can't we, can't we, can't save it now
Our love, our love won't make it now
No one really wins this time
No one really wins this time around
No one really wins this time
Nobody

No one, no one, no one, no, no
No one, no one, no one, no, no

Love, our love, our love, can't make it now
Can't we, can't we, can't save it now
Our love, our love won't make it now
No one really wins this time
No one really wins this time around
No one really wins this time
Nobody
No one really wins this time
No one really wins this time around
No one really wins this time
Nobody
