You stand with the gun in your hand
Staring at the wall with a look so sad
Thinking about who really cares
And will they even notice if I just disappeared
In one bang, blood rushed to the head
She'd rather fly through the sky than walk with the dead
She stays high while the world goes by
Just another day here waiting to die
But life is beautiful
You share a little love with the whole wide world
Every boy and girl sing along
When we sing why-o
Why-o
And she cries but her man denies
Its funny how love comes with so many lies
He said he'd never do it again
So she puts on a smile and starts to pretend
And she hides all the pain inside
While filling up her arms with pretty little lines
She cuts with no intent to kill
This time she didn't do it
But someday she will
But life is beautiful
You share a little love with the whole wide world
Every boy and girl sing this song
When we sing why-o
Why-o
And hey, you're beautiful
And there's enough love for the whole wide world
Every boy and girl sing along
When we sing why-o
Why-o
And hey
I know that you can find a way
You're beautiful to me
No matter what the people say
Its all gonna be okay
You're beautiful to me
Too weak, too weary to try
Too angry inside, well so am I
I'm all alone with nobody else
I'm so in need of help, I keep reminding myself
That life is beautiful
So share a little love with the whole wide world
Every boy and girl sing this song
When they sing why-o
Why-o
And hey, you're beautiful
And there's enough love for the whole wide world
Every boy and girl sing along
When they sing why-o
Why-o
And hey
I know that you can find a way
You're beautiful to me, you're beautiful, you're beautiful
No matter what the people say
It's all gonna be okay
You're beautiful to me, you're beautiful, you're beautiful
It's all gonna end someday
It's all gonna fade away
You're beautiful to me
You're beautiful to me
You're beautiful to me
You're beautiful to me
You're beautiful to me
