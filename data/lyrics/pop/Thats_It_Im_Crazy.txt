Oh, you're bad enough to me
Bad enough that we
Always have something to get over
Oh, you dress up so happy
Lookin' so fancy
I got that salty chip on my shoulder
Oh, but when the night is deep
You find me in the streets
Asking me to come over

That's it, that's it, that's it
That's it, I'm crazy, that's it I'm crazy
That's it, that's it, that's it
That's it, I'm crazy
That's it, that's it, that's it

Oh, but when the night is deep
You find me in the streets
Asking me to come over
That's it, I'm crazy

That's it, that's it, that's it, yeah, you're crazy
That's it, that's it, that's it, yeah, you're crazy
That's it, that's it, that's it, yeah, you're crazy
That's it, that's it, that's it, yeah, you're crazy
That's it, that's it, that's it, yeah, you're crazy
Oh, you're bad enough to me
Bad enough that we
Always have something to get over
Oh, you dress up so happy
Looking so fancy
I got that salty chip on my shoulder
Oh, but when the night is deep
You find me in the streets
Asking me to come over

That's it, that's it, that's it
That's it, I'm crazy
That's it, that's it, that's it
That's it, I'm crazy
That's it, that's it, that's it
That's it, I'm crazy
That's it, that's it, that's it
That's it, I'm crazy

Oh
