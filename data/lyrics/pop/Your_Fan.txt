Oh, I wish that I could be your fan again

Armour sweet and free mystery
When, man, you were the band
I see you TV, magazine
Everybody says that you’re living the dream

Oh, I wish that I could be your fan again

I remember camping out all night
Waiting for you at the stadium
And before that, front row
Every show at the club where it began
Now, I just sit there at a screen
I don’t wanna love a boy in a machine

Oh, I wish that I could be your fan again

People always up and go
I just wanna listen slow to records on the stereo
Talk to you through TV shows
In a modern town that does not close
Now, I’m up here watchin' the roadies
Strike the stage and pack the van
And a girl comes up to me, smile on her face
And says, "Hey, are you the band?"
I feel the press of something mean
Everybody says that we're livin' the dream
Guess that’s what it’s got to be

But I wish that I could be your fan again
Oh, I wish that I could be your fan again
