Nice to see you
How you doing?
Did you know you're
Really something
You make me feel things
I don't believe in
It's all up in my heart
And all up in my spine those chills

I 'spose someday these roads will reach the sea
It's safe to say they're tailor-made for replaying scenes
But I'm too pensive
To decide what's real
All cause you left me with a heart chock-full of chills

In the morning sun
You and I are one
Fingers through my hair
Feel them everywhere
Don't know what to think
Am I still dreaming
You're so perfect baby were you made for me
Nice to see you
How you doing?
Did you know you're
Really something
You make me feel things
I don't believe in
It's all up in my heart
And all up in my spine those chills
Hope it works out
In the long run
I think about you and
Then the month's gone
I'll raise the issue in
Tangential love songs
It's all up in my heart
And all up in my spine those chills
Those chills
