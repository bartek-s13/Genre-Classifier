I'll have a good, good time when I need ya
Because I know you need me too
And everybody's looking for something
But when I'm lost I'm calling on you

Calling on you, you, you, you, you, you
Calling on you
Calling on you
Calling on you
But when I'm lost I'm calling
I'm lost I'm calling on you
You, you

I'll have a good, good time when I need ya
Because I know you need me too
And everybody's looking for something
But when I'm lost I'm calling on you
I'll have a good, good time when I need ya
Because I know you need me too
And everybody's looking for something
But when I'm lost I'm calling on you

Calling on you, you, you, you, you, you
But when I'm lost I'm calling
I'm lost I'm calling on you
Calling on you
Calling on you
But when I'm lost I'm calling
I'm lost I'm calling on you
You, you
Calling on you, you, you
Calling on you, you
But when I'm lost I'm calling
I'm lost I'm calling on you
