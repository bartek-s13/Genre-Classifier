Feels nice
Driving down the coastline with you by my side
Hand in hand tonight, gripping oh so tight
Ooh, honey

I may have miscalculated
I could have left you out of this mess
I may have miscalculated
I could have left you out of this mess
I may have miscalculated
Could have left you out of this mess
It's so crazy

I’ve been craving your every touch
My eyes can't get enough
Its hard to say were in love
We’ve been miming like animals
No words come from above
Our minds were left in the dust, yeah
So, let me take you home, let me take you home
Let me take you home, let me take you home

I've seen the sights
Rolling on teenage vibes
Reminiscing on our feeble lives
It's so pretty
I may have miscalculated
I may have miscalculated
I may have miscalculated, yeah
It's so crazy

I’ve been craving your every touch
My eyes can't get enough (My eyes can't get enough)
Its hard to say were in love (My eyes can't get enough)
We’ve been miming like animals
No words come from above (No words come from above)
Our minds were left in the dust, yeah (No words come from above)
So, let me take you home, let me take you home
Let me take you home, let me take you home

I’ve been craving your every touch
My eyes can't get enough (My eyes can't get enough)
Its hard to say were in love (My eyes can't get enough)
We’ve been miming like animals
No words come from above (It's so pretty)
Our minds were left in the dust, yeah
So, let me take you home (Let me take you home)
Let me take you home (Let me take you home)
Let me take you home (Let me, let me)
Let me take you home
