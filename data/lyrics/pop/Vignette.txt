I've been walled in for so long
With just enough of the love I lost
Watching from the sidelines
Waiting for signs that it's alright

Cause I will float through the night time
And I get lost in the daylight
But I can't follow to meet you
You're far away out, out on the other side

Images of you, wo-o-o-o-o-o-oah
Images of you, wo-o-o-o-o-o-oah
That I can't let go, o-o-o-o-o-oh

Are you with me?
Are you with me?

I can feel your heart beating soft now
Just telling me that I'll be fine
When you're gone I will never know
So tell me where the love goes
Cause I will float through the night time
And I get lost in the daylight
But I can't follow to meet you
You're far away out, out on the other side

Images of you, wo-o-o-o-o-o-oah
Images of you, wo-o-o-o-o-o-oah
That I can't let go, o-o-o-o-o-oh
Images of you, wo-o-o-o-o-o-oah
That I can't let go, o-o-o-o-o-oh
