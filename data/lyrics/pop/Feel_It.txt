It's hard to explain
We feel it, we feel it
Hands to hands again
When we feel it, we feel it
Little boy, take time
Let your mind not go too fast
'Cause then they'll make you run, run, run
'Til your heart fills up
And you don't want that
You wanna feel it

But you can't stop us now
You're all alone
Whoa!

They say things shatter
But it's the things that matter
So go away, so go away (Ahh)
They say things shatter
But it's the things that matter
So go away, so go away (Ahh)

It's hard to get lost
Don't let them feel it
It's only with you
I'll keep telling myself
That I'll go with my valuable friends
But if we should fall in two different worlds
I know that I'll always be there with you
My eyes to eyes
Our hands to hands
It's hard to explain, but we'll feel it again

But you can't stop us now
You're all alone
Whoa!

They say things shatter
But it's the things that matter
So go away, so go away (Ahh)
They say things shatter
But it's the things that matter
So go away, so go away (Ahh)

But you can't stop us now
You're all alone
Whoa!

They say things shatter
But it's the things that matter
So go away, so go away (Ahh)
They say things shatter
But it's the things that matter
So go away, so go away (Ahh)

They say things—
They say things—
