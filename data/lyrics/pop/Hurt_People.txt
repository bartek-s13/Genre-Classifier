<<<<<<< HEAD
I'm a better man 'cause of you
Thought we had a chance
That's true
But you have weapons
Didn't know you have weapons
Now I'm insecure and stressed out
When someone gets close, I shut down
Always we second-guessin'
Got so many questions

You did it to me, 'cause he did it to you
And now I'm gonna turn around
And do it to my new girl
I do it to her, she do it to him
This cycle won't ever end 'cause

Hurt people hurt people
Hurt people, so lethal
Around and around we go
Guess we're used to the pain
Everybody heart breaking
Hungover, love wasted
It's too much we can't take it
Yeah, we all feel the pain
Hurt people hurt people
Hurt people hurt people

Okay, I'm sick of the games
I'm sick and I feel like I'm wastin' my time
I don't see how you're so good at doin' your make up
But can't seem to make up your mind
You drive me crazy disobeyin' the signs
I know that you took an emotional bullet
But now you're the one with the gun and it's loaded
And pointed right at me, you hurt people
And you don't even know it
Girl you turn me into a poet
Every time you get me in my emotions
Baby the love that we had was explosive
We had to blow it
It's just how it goes when you're young
And you're easily broken
Man, it's pretty easy to notice
Hurt people hurt people

Hurt people hurt people
Hurt people, so lethal
Around and around we go
Guess we're used to the pain
Everybody heart breaking
Hungover, love wasted
It's too much we can't take it
Yeah, we all feel the pain
Hurt people hurt people

I don't wanna hurt you
Baby, I deserve you
I been waitin' for a long, long, long, long time
If we could learn to stab each other in the back a little bit less
Then we could last a long, long
Long, long, long time
If we could learn to stab each other in the back a little bit less
Then we could last a long, long, long, long time
Long, long, long time

Hurt people hurt people
Hurt people, so lethal
Around and around we go
Guess we're used to the pain
Everybody heart breaking
Hungover, love wasted
It's too much we can't take it
Yeah, we all feel the pain
