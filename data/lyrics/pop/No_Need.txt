You're so damn obsessed with the way I dress and talk
With the way I move and walk, when you shouldn't give a.. Ohh
You're so out of line with the way you spend your time
Asking what is yours vs. mine

When you don't know where I been
What I'm doing who I'm with
You don't know anything bout my life
Who are you to pick a fight
I got some words for you

There's no need to be unkind
No need to be unkind
No need to be unkind to me  (oh yeah)
There's no need to be unkind
No need to be unkind
No need to be unkind to me
You got your own life
I got my own life
Get on with your life and I'll get on with mine
There's no need to be unkind
No need to be unkind
No need to be unkind to me

I don't mean to be rude, but you're spoiling the mood
Feelings mutual and nude, hate to call out on this feud but
You're so out of line with the way you spend your time
Asking what is yours vs mine

When you don't know where I been
What I'm doing, who I'm with
You don't know anything about my life
Who are you to pick a fight
I got some words for you

There's no need to be unkind
No need to be unkind
No need to be unkind to me  (oh yeah)
There's no need to be unkind
No need to be unkind
No need to be unkind to me
You got your own life
I got my own life
Get on with your life and I'll get on with mine
There's no need to be unkind
No need to be unkind
No need to be unkind to me

There's no need to be unkind
No need to be unkind
No need to be unkind to me  (oh yeah)
There's no need to be unkind
No need to be unkind
No need to be unkind to me
You got your own life
I got my own life
Get on with your life and I'll get on with mine
There's no need to be unkind
No need to be unkind
No need to be unkind to me
