We can't pretend
That we can be friends
So I'll bite my tongue
While you think that I'm playing dumb
In a couple years, we'll be somewhere else
'Cause the future's got a funny way of proving
Evil and good are both misunderstood
They promise everything
Or they trust it all
The liars and the lovers will think
They can't afford to fall
But when the beds are cold
And there's only pain
The liars and the lovers will know
They gotta' make a change
It's lovely to think
I remind you of all your mistakes
But I just can't shake this feeling that I'm
Lying in this bed that I made
In a couple years, we'll be somewhere else
'Cause the future's got a funny way of proving
Evil and good are both misunderstood
They promise everything
Or they trust it all
The liars and the lovers will think
They can't afford to fall
But when the beds are cold
And there's only pain
The liars and the lovers will know
They gotta' make a change
Should we even work this out?
Could I ever hear you out?
Would you hear me screaming out?
They promise everything
Or they trust it all
The liars and the lovers will think
They can't afford to fall
But when the beds are cold
And there's only pain
The liars and the lovers will know
They gotta' make a change
