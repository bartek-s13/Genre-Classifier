You're like popcorn, tasty
Can't get enough, I want you on the daily
It's so good, it's a habit
I need a refill 'cause I gotta have it

And I know I should stop
But the way that you talk
Makes me spin like a clock
Around, around, around, now
You got me, oh no
So what should I do?

I kinda need to quit ya
I kinda wanna stay
'Cause baby when I'm with ya
You know it feels too good to walk away
Just when I'm learning my lesson
Ready to leave you behind
You do the thing that I'm missing
Making me losing my mind, ooh-oh
So what should I do?

What should I do?
Tell me, what should I do? (oh!)
What should I do?
Tell me, what should I do?

I'm like popcorn (popcorn), tasty
Heat it up, and don't you go and waste it
I can be a little salty, but I'm sweet
Long as you keep it real with me

And I know I should stop (I know, I know)
But the way that you talk
Makes me spin like a clock
Around, around, around, now
You got me, oh no
So what should I do?

I kinda need to quit ya
I kinda wanna stay (oh!)
'Cause baby when I'm with ya
You know it feels too good to walk away
Just when I'm learning my lesson
Ready to leave you behind
You do the thing that I'm missing
Making me losing my mind, ooh-oh
So what should I do?

What should I do?
Tell me what should I do? (oh!)
What should I do?
Tell me what should I do?

And just when I'm learning my lesson
Ready to leave you behind
You do the thing that I'm missing
Yeah, eh, eh

I kinda need to quit ya
I kinda wanna stay (oh!)
'Cause baby when I'm with ya
You know it feels too good to walk away
Just when I'm learning my lesson
Ready to leave you behind
You do the thing that I'm missing
Making me losing my mind, ooh-oh
So what should I do?
