Going overboard
I don't wanna stop now
You just struck a chord
Spinning me around
It's the energy
It's the chemistry
Oh, oh

Give me something that I never had
Give me something and I'll meet you halfway
A little something that's gonna make it last
One for you
One for me

I, I need your loving
Give, give, give me something
All, all, all or nothing
Keep, keep, keep me buzzing
Buzzing
Buzzing
Buzzing
Buzzing
Fire in your eyes
Striking me like lightning
Warming up my soul
Oh, it's hypnotizing
It's the energy
It's the chemistry
Oh, oh

Give me something that I never had
Give me something and I'll meet you halfway
A little something that's gonna make it last
One for you
One for me

I, I need your loving
Give, give, give me something
All, all, all or nothing
Keep, keep, keep me buzzing
Buzzing
