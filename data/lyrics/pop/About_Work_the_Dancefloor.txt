Here we go again, my love
You've got so much time to spend
If I come around again
It may never go anywhere

'Cause I don't have much in terms of money now
I don't have material gifts for you
You want me to stay a while, stay a while
To be in a moment with you

I was just thinking about work the dancefloor
I was just thinking about work the dancefloor
I was just thinking about work the dancefloor
I was just thinking about work the dancefloor

Finally my heart slipped
Finally I found something new
What if the moment didn't stick?
Would I be spending no more time with you?

'Cause I don't have much in terms of money now
I don't have material gifts for you
You want me to stay a while, stay a while
To be in a moment with you, no

I was just thinking about work the dancefloor
I was just thinking about work the dancefloor
I was just thinking about work the dancefloor
I was just thinking about work the dancefloor

Now our hearts have a beat that doesn't stick
No
Now my heart has a moment that we don't share
Oh

I don't have much in terms of money now
And I don't have material gifts for you
You want me to stay a while, stay a while
To be in a moment with you

These moments with you
Moments with you
Moments with you
Moments
To be in a moment with you, no
These moments with you
Moments with you
Moments with you
Moments
These moments with you
I was just thinking about work the dancefloor
