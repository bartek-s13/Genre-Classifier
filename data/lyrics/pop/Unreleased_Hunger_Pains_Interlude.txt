<<<<<<< HEAD
The emptiness of unfulfillment grows
And overflow from the pit of the core of my in disparity man
Can’t worry about embarrassment
So we run from the harassment
Too angry on the average have
Been so hungry for the cabin
So so lonely from the lavish life that I live
Once I’m established
Wife and kids know doin bus is the best way to live
No moving backwards
Game of itches life's snitches if you take
The time to break the tackle
Break the tackles and the chain
Don’t break your back don’t blow your brain
Increase our cash increase our wealth
I’ll hurt your health or go insane
Show the patiences lead the matrix
And may your strength come back in the rain
Let the thunder of your tell the sun to earthly pain
Left from hunger from deep under
Overstand these earthly games
Learn to play as soon as the mood upon
For these fakers take no blame
Bring your A team play to win team
Let those haters say your name
