<<<<<<< HEAD
At my parents in Carolina
Back home for the weekend
And I'm overthinking
I know you sense it, I'm being distant
I've felt this before
But this time can't ignore
I know you're gettin' back home in an airplane
'Bout to leave LA
But there's something I gotta say
I know you know but I don't wanna tell you
It hurts me, it hurts you
But that's what I have to do

Will I still feel this when I see you?
Will we still be us when I see you?
Will I still feel this when I see you?
Will we still be us when I see you?

My friends don't know yet
Haven't told my parents
With nowhere to start
Damn, I'm falling apart
I know you're nervous
I hate the fact that we're up in the air
While you're up in the air
So let me know when your phone's off airplane mode
Just got back into town
Baby, I'm freakin' out
How do we even start this conversation?
I'm crying just thinking about
We haven't talked about
Will I still feel this when I see you?
Will we still be us when I see you?
Will I still feel this when I see you?

Girl, am I losing my mind?
Oh God, I hope I'm not right, yeah
Girl, am I losing my mind?
Oh God, I hope I'm not right
(Oh God, I hope I'm not right)
