Mighty river run, run, run away
And pick up all the fish on your way
Mighty river run, run, run through the day
And save me from the great birds of prey
I'm okay now that I follow you
My heart shines a deep shade of blue
Know that I am closer now
Know that I am closer now to you, oh
Mighty river run, run, run away
And pick up all the fish on your way
Mighty river run, run, run through the day
And save me from the great birds of prey
I'm okay now that I follow you
My heart shines a deep shade of blue
Know that I am closer now
Know that I am closer now to you, oh

And hear me out for now
Even though you've got to go
Even though you capture those who stray
Hear me now
I'm here and all I want to see
Is never let imagination fade
Hear me out for now
Even though you've got to go
Even though you capture those who stray
Hear me now
I'm here and all I want to see
Is never let imagination stray

Mighty river run, run, run away
And pick up all the fish on your way
Mighty river run, run, run through the day
And save me from the great birds of prey
I'm okay now that I follow you
My heart shines a deep shade of blue
Know that I am closer now
