<<<<<<< HEAD
Staring at my city from my high rise view
Smoking this blunt to forget about you
Used to be so easy, now it's all I do
What can I say? You know I got issues
Said you'd never lie to me
You said you would die for me
When I just gave you all of me
So, baby, can we work it out?
Girl, I want your everything
Yeah, you know it's killing me
I want your body on me
So, baby, can we work it out?
Don't put out the flames to our fire
Don't want you to go
I want you to know that
Feeling like we're down to the wire
I'm not giving up
When you're all I got
And I've been feeling so lost
'Cause I've been needing your touch
Don't put out the flames to our fire
I'm missing you when you're gone
I've been going crazy, I just wish you knew
You don't gotta run after all we've been through
You say you don't love me, but I know you do
How can you just leave when you know I need you?
Said you'd never lie to me
You said you would die for me
When I just gave you all of me
So, baby, can we work it out?
Girl, I want your everything
Yeah, you know it's killing me
I want your body on me
So, baby, can we work it out?
Don't put out the flames to our fire
Don't want you to go
I want you to know that
Feeling like we're down to the wire
I'm not giving up
When you're all I got
And I've been feeling so lost
'Cause I've been needing your touch
Don't put out the flames to our fire
I'm missing you when you're gone
Don't put out the flames to our fire
No, I'm not giving up, no
And I'm feeling like we're down to the wire
Don't put out the flames to our fire (Don't put out the flames)
Don't want you to go
I want you to know that (I want you to know)
Feeling like we're down to the wire
I'm not giving up
When you're all I got (You're all I got)
And I've been feeling so lost (I've been feeling so lost)
'Cause I've been needing your touch (I need your touch, need your touch, yeah)
Don't put out the flames to our fire (To our fire)
