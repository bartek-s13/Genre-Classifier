You thought she was yours
You thought you had her for good...
See I thought she was mine
I guess I misunderstood...

Now the clues that she gave me
Were the same that she left for you...
And the hints that she gave me
Weren't hints meant for two...

So tell me what you're feeling
I don't want no problems
Show me how to fix this...
She was out flirtin'
I was here hurtin'...
So show me how to fix this baby...

And she thought I'd leave town
But I'm saying this is not over...
Oh I'll be sticking around
Till you kiss me when your sober...yeah..

Cuz' the looks that she gave me
Were the same that she gave to you...no....
And the pain that she left me
Was different from the pain you felt...

So tell me what you're feeling
I don't want no problems
Show me how to fix this...
She was out flirtin'
I was here hurtin'...
So show me how to fix this baby...

And you got me like, no no no... no no no...
And you got me like, no no no... no no noooo...
You got me like, no no no... no no no...
Well you got me like, no no no... no no no...
