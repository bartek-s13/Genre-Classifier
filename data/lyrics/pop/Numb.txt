When all is said and done
Tell me how to write this, tell me how to fight this war
I'll keep marchin' on
Like a broken robot, money back guarantee

I'm in your custody
But I'm not a criminal, I can be your next big thing
Look at what I've become
Silly little monster, should've just held my tongue

I hate the feeling of this weight upon my shoulders
Pushing the pressure down on me
You think you want the best for me but nothing really matters
If you force it, it won't come, I guess I'm feeling
Numb
I guess I'm feeling
Numb

Sometimes I wish I could fly
Through a secret trap door, into another life (life)
Bury my head in the sand
I don't want to grow up, la la la la la la la
I hate the feeling of this weight upon my shoulders
Pushing the pressure down on me
You think you want the best for me but nothing really matters
If you force it, it won't come, I guess I'm feeling
Numb
I guess I'm feeling
Numb

I'll play the game, I'll do everything you tell me
All the losers win in the end
I'll play the game, I'll do anything you tell me
All the losers win in the end

I hate the feeling of this weight upon my shoulders
Pushing the pressure down on me
You think you want the best for me but nothing really matters
If you force it, it won't come, I guess I'm feeling
Numb
I guess I'm feeling
Numb
I guess I'm feeling numb
I guess I'm feeling
Numb
