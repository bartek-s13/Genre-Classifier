It's funny how they say when you find someone
Heart speeds up, time slows down
Things get heavy, heavy but you know we ain't done yet
It's funny how you wait 'til the moment comes
Moment's here, moment's gone
Kiss you heavy heavy but you know we ain't done yet

Cause it's those lights
Like somebody put that bluey on fire
Do you think there's anybody up high looking down
Watching us, wishing we'd enjoy the ride
'Cause we happen to be feeling alright
Whatever happens got this feeling I like
And it's happening to us
And we're not even on drugs

Why make things complicated
When we could stay like that
Why make things so much harder
We could be gone like that
We'll come across them days that go
Out their way to bring us down to our knees
So for once, baby for once
Baby for once, be here with me
Be here with me
It's funny how we say that it's all 'gon change
No more lies, no more space
When shit comes ready, ready 'cause you know we ain't done yet
I love you and you love me, but our boat is rocking
Storm's right here, let it in
But keep it steady, steady 'cause you know we ain't done yet

'Cause it's those lights
Like somebody put that bluey on fire
Do you think there's anybody up high looking down
Watching us, wishing we'd enjoy the ride
Cause we happen to be feeling alright
Whatever happens got this feeling I like
And it's happening to us
And we're not even on drugs

Why make things complicated
When we could stay like that
Why make things so much harder
We could be gone like that
We'll come across them days that go
Out their way to bring us down to our knees
So for once, baby for once
Baby for once, be here with me
'Cause it's those lights
Like somebody put that bluey on fire
Do you think there's anybody up high looking down
Watching us, wishing we'd enjoy the ride
Cause we happen to be feeling alright
Whatever happens got this feeling I like
