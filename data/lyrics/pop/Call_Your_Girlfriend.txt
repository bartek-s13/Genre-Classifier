Call your girlfriend
It's time you had the talk
Give your reasons
Say it's not her fault
But you just met somebody new

Tell her not to get upset
Second guessing everything you've said and done
And when she get upset
Tell her that you never meant to hurt no one

You just tell her that the only way her heart will mend
Is when she learns to love again
But it won't make sense right now
But you're still her friend
And then you let her down easy

Call your girlfriend
It's time you had the talk
Give your reasons
Say it's not her fault
But you just met somebody new
Don't you tell her that I give you something
That you never even knew you missed
Don't you even try to explain
How it's so different when we kiss

Yeah, you just tell her that the only way her heart will mend
Is when she learns to love again
But it won't make sense right now
But you're still her friend
And then you let her down easy

Call your girlfriend
It's time you had the talk
Give your reasons
Say it's not her fault
But you just met somebody new
