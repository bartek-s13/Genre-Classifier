Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

Hush, my darling, don't you cry no more
We have made it through these nights before
Feels like we're stuck inside a dream
We're slipping away from what is real

So wake up, love
I miss you, I miss you
It's been too long
And I miss you
I miss you

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

Out of sticks and stones we made a bed
And filled it up with broken hopes and words unsaid
Feels like we're stuck somewhere in between
While we say what we mean

So wake up, love
I miss you, I miss you
It's been too long
And I miss you
I miss you

So don't close your eyes
It's safe for lullabies
Wake up, love
I miss you
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
I miss you
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
I miss you
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
I miss you
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

So wake up, love
