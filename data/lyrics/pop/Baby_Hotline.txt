Baby Hotline
Please hold me close to you
Baby flatline
Still time to do it too (Ha-ha-ha!)
Baby snack time
Chow down to earth
But in your head she's a

Hoarder of quarters
No boundary boredom-dom
Boundary boredom!

I contend that your drinking eye has never opened
I insist somebody will die
And I hate hoping
Wishing that the pills let you cry
And I hate coping
Someday I will go back outside
And see her okay
