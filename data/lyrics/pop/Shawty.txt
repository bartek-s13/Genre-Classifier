Shawty know she phony
Shawty feeling lonely
Shawty picking on me
While I’m picking up her laundry
Shawty wanna kiss me
Like she kissing on her daddy
Shawty wanna fuck me
But only when she likes me
What do I do when my baby gets sober?
Take her miles away
I'll let you down right before he you can haunt you
Take you miles away like
Where did you go?
I wish I could find another way to tell you that you’re not alone
I wish I could find another way to tell you...
I’m standing on the porcelain
I’m eating at a Bennigan’s
I’m trynna find a way back in
Like where did you go...where did you go?
Shawty know she phony
Shawty feeling lonely

Shawty wanna fuck me
But only when she likes me
I'm like okay, okay, okay, okay
I want that poké poké
Lowkey lowkey lowkey lowkey
I wanna rim-bim-bow on the sidewalk
To go to fricky-frick town when the lights off
I got plenty thangs
Playing plenty of games
Good at picking your brain
While you getting paid and I’m making bank
And your money stinks
We’re gonna love it away
We’re gonna love it away
Where did you go?
I wish I could find another way to tell you that you’re not alone
I wish I could find another way to tell you...
I’m standing on the porcelain
I’m eating at a Bennigan’s
I’m tryna find a way back in
Like where did you go...where did you go?
