I just wanna be alone tonight
I just wanna take a little breather
Cause lately all we do is fight
And every time it cuts me deeper
Cause somethin’s changed
You been actin’ so strange
And it’s taken its toll on me
It’s safe to say that I’m ready to let you leave

Without you
I live it up a little more every day
Without you
I’m seein’ myself so differently
I didn’t wanna believe it then
But it all worked out in the end
When I watched you walk away
Well I never thought I’d say I’m fine
Without you

Called you up cause it’s been long enough
And you said that you were so much better
We have done a lot of growing up
We were never meant to be together

Cause somethin changed
You were actin’ so strange
And it’s taken its toll on me
It’s safe to say that I’m ready to let you leave

Without you
I live it up a little more every day
Without you
I’m seein’ myself so differently
I didn’t wanna believe it then
But it all worked out in the end
When I watched you walk away
Well I never thought I’d say I’m fine
Without you

Cause somethin changed
You were actin’ so strange
And it’s taken its toll on me
It’s safe to say that I’m ready to let you leave

Without you
I live it up a little more every day
Without you
I’m seein’ myself so differently
I didn’t wanna believe it then
But it all worked out in the end
When I watched you walk away
Well I never thought I’d say I’m fine
Without you

Without you
Without you
Without you
I just wanna be alone tonight
I just wanna take a little breather
