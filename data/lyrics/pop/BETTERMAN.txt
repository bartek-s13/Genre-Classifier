I would save your tears, let's not make a scene
No, I don't wanna hear you don't wanna get older
Older
You are not the same, yeah, we live and learn
But tellin' by your face, it'll never be over
Over, yeah

Go turn your back on it
You could run a mile
Oh, he said, yeah
All you can do is wake up and smile

No I don't really have a plan
Makin' me into a better man
Tried and I've tried
I can't make this up
'Cause time after time I fall back on love
I don't really have a plan
Makin' me into a better man
All that you see
Well, it's all that I've got
And it's all yours even if that's not enough
Something's got me tied up
When I take a seat beside ya
Oh, I know, something's got me tied up
So I should say what's on my mind, oh
Suffocatin', wrapped up, matter fact
I match the way I walk with the way I act, so what
So what, mmm, yeah
I don't want you to see what a state I'm in
Lasso 'round my thoughts trying to reign 'em in closer
Closer, mmm

Go turn your back on it
You could run a mile, babe
Oh, he said, yeah
All you can do is wake up and smile

No I don't really have a plan
Makin' me into a better man
Tried and I've tried
I can't make this up
'Cause time after time I fall back on love
I don't really have a plan
Makin' me into a better man
All that you see
Well, it's all that I've got
And it's all yours even if that's not enough
Something's got me tied up
When I take a seat beside ya
Oh, I know, something's got me tied up
So I should say what's on my mind, oh

No, I don't really have a plan
Makin' me into a better man
Tried and I've tried
I can't make this up
'Cause time after time I fall back on love
I don't really have a plan
Makin' me into a better man
All that you see
Well, it's all that I've got
But, it's all yours even if it's not enough
