I've been held back by the enemy in me
And I've been held up by the memories I keep, somebody save me
Can't build no bridge when it's too far to see
Feeling down when you walk out on me

And I can't remember what's right
You put me down the whole time
So tell me, tell me this time
Tell me, tell me

Am I crazy?
Am I livin' in another life
Am I crazy?
'Cause lately I don't even wanna try
Somebody save me
Feel like I'm about to lose my mind
Am I crazy?
No, no, I'm not giving up the fight

I'm woken up by the enemy in me
And it's enough, stop tryna tell me who to be, don't call me crazy
I'll build a bridge when it's too far to reach
I feel it now, when you fall out on me

And I can't remember what's right
You put me down the whole time
So tell me, tell me this time
Tell me, tell me

Am I crazy?
Am I living in another life
Am I crazy?
'Cause lately I don't even wanna try
Somebody save me
Feel like I'm about to lose my mind
Am I crazy?
No, no I'm not giving up the fight

I, I --
Just tell me if I'm breaking apart
'Cause lately I don't know where to start
You could be the enemy in me
But, this could be my everything
You could be the enemy in me
But, this could be my everything
You could be the enemy in me
But, this could be my everything
