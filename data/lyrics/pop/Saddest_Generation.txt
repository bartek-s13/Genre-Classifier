You told me you didn't love me, I said that you did
You sad motherfucker, you sad motherfucker
You made me a bike and you told me to ride
Then you broke my heart one night
Now I don't want another
No, I don't want another

Your brain is sick and your eyes are blue
Coulda sworn I saw right into you
And I know you cared
From the way you remembered everything I said, ooh

One in four, one in four
We must be the saddest generation
Is there any hope for us all?
One in four, one in four
Where is the emotional education we're all looking for?

You said that I shouldn't want you, I said I still did
You mad motherfucker, you mad motherfucker
You hated the world and you told me you wouldn't work out
'Cause you didn't want kids
But I just wanna love ya
Yeah, I just wanna love ya

Your brain is sick and your eyes are blue
I coulda sworn I saw right into you
And I know you cared
From the way you looked when I told you I was scared, ooh

One in four, one in four
We must be the saddest generation
Is there any hope for us all?
One in four, one in four
Where is the emotional education we're all looking for?

But I should've known better
I could never make you better
Oh, I should've known better
I was never gonna make you better
(I was never gonna make you better, ooh)
(I was never gonna make you better, ooh)

One in four, one in four
We must be the saddest generation
Is there any hope for us all?
One in four, one in four
We must be the loneliest generation
We don't know what we are looking for

We don't know what we are looking for
