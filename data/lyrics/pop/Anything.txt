I will be there
Always waiting
Waiting for you
To let me inside
Where your fire burns
In a city of angels
Just like a river rushing straight into the sea
I'm the one thing meant for you and you for me

Whatever you want
Whatever you need
Whatever it takes, I'll do anything
And as you sleep
Eyes to the window
I'm watching you dream
Well are you dreaming of me?
So why can't you see
You're all that matters
You know if this earth should crack
I'll be your solid ground
I will be there to catch you when you fall down

If I have to crawl
Get down on my knees
Whatever it takes, I'll do anything
I'd take the stars right out of the sky for you
I'd end the world give you the sun, the moon
For all of time, forever loving you
Whatever you need
Whatever it takes, I'll do anything
If I have to crawl
Get down on my knees
