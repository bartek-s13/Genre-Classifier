I'm a fool now
Maybe I'm just trying to work it out
Just getting through now
Lately, I've been thinking upside down

Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh
Tell me where, I'm going wrong
Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh
We don't have to be alone

I can see the brighter days
I can see the sun breaking through those clouds
Heaven knows we’re all afraid
But we just keep holding on
Woah-oh-oh-oh
I can see the brighter days
I can see the sun breaking through those clouds
Heaven knows we’re all afraid
But we just keep holding on
For the brighter days

Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh
But we just keep holding on
For the brighter days
Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh
But we just keep holding on
For the brighter days
Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh
Just keep holding, just keep holding
It's a fine line
Between the light of day and the dead of night
I'm on the outside
Looking for a reason to change my mind

Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh
Tell me where, I'm going wrong
Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh
We don't have to be alone

I can see the brighter days
I can see the sun breaking through those clouds
Heaven knows we’re all afraid
But we just keep holding on
For the brighter days

Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh
But we just keep holding on
For the brighter days
Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh
But we just keep holding on
For the brighter days
Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh
I can see the brighter days
I can see the sun breaking through those clouds
Heaven knows we’re all afraid
But we just keep holding on
For the brighter days

Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh
But we just keep holding on
Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh
But we just keep holding on
To the brightest days
