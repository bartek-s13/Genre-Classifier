I get stuck on every line
Trying to find the words to say to you
Trying to find a way to get through to you, yeah
I just thought we needed time
This time, time ain't gonna heal it
Oh, and you're too proud to even see it, yeah

We're in a mess, this ship is wrecked
I've done my best but I ain't done yet

Are we just gonna throw it all away?
Are we just gonna throw it all away?
All the years and all the f*ck-ups that we made
I'd make them all again 'cause they were made for you
Just gonna throw it all away?
Are we just gonna throw it all away?
All the years and all the f*ck-ups that we made
I'd make them all again 'cause they were made for you
For you, for you, for you, for you
For you, for you, for you, for you
For you, for you, for you, for you
I'd make them all again 'cause they were made for you
Why do we always have to fight?
When all I'm trying to do is reach for ya
I can't remember the last time I held ya, no
And what's left here to hurt us now?
When all our parts have gone to pieces
And we might have lost the ones we needed

We're in a mess, this ship is wrecked
I've done my best but I ain't done yet

Are we just gonna throw it all away?
Are we just gonna throw it all away?
All the years and all the f*ck-ups that we made
I'd make them all again 'cause they were made for you
Just gonna throw it all away?
Are we just gonna throw it all away?
All the years and all the f*ck-ups that we made
I'd make them all again 'cause they were made for you
For you, for you, for you, for you
For you, for you, for you, for you
For you, for you, for you, for you
I'd make them all again 'cause they were made for you
No, don't let it go
No, don't let it go
Oh, I'd make them all, I'd make them all
I'd make them all, I'd make them all again
No, don't let it go
No, don't let it go
I'd make them all again 'cause they were made for you

Just gonna throw it all away?
Are we just gonna throw it all away?
All the years and all the f*ck-ups that we made
I'd make them all again 'cause they were made for you
For you, for you, for you, for you
