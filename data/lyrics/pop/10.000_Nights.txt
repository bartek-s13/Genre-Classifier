<<<<<<< HEAD
I was not looking for arty-farty love
I wanted someone to love completely
And someone more than weekly
I was looking for a decent boy
For a tender glance, woh-oh-oh
For a safety dance, woh-oh-oh

The wuthering heights
And the stormy nights

You give me ten thousand nights of thunder
But I will give them all back to you
'Cause you're so ooh (Du-du-du), you're so ah (Du-du-du)
You're so cool

You came like a thief in the night and stole my heart
Ooh, like a solitude erasure
Like an elevator
And I know we'd do anything for love (Oh yeah)
And it is you and me, woh-oh-oh
For all eternity, woh-oh-oh
The wuthering heights
And the stormy nights

You give me ten thousand nights of thunder
But I will give them all back to you
'Cause you're so ooh (Du-du-du), you're so ah (Du-du-du)
You're so cool (Baby, you're so super-supremely-ba-ba-di-oh)
It feels like ten thousand nights of thunder
When I've spent one with you
'Cause you're so ooh (Du-du-du), you're so ah (Du-du-du)
You're so cool (Baby, you're so super-supremely-ba-ba-di-oh)

And baby, baby, you're irresistible and I'm insatiable (Ooh, ooh-ooh, oh-oh)
Yeah, love is an ocean of sweet emotion (Sweet emotion)

You give me ten thousand nights of thunder
But I will give them all back to you
'Cause you're so ooh (Du-du-du), you're so ah (Du-du-du)
You're so cool (Baby, you're so super-supremely-ba-ba-di-oh)
It feels like ten thousand nights of thunder
When I've spent one with you
'Cause you're so ooh (Du-du-du), you're so ah (Du-du-du)
You're so cool (Baby, you're so super-supremely-ba-ba-di-oh)
Yeah, you give me ten thousand nights of thunder
But I'll give them all back to you
'Cause you're so ooh (Du-du-du), you're so ah (Du-du-du)
You're so cool (Baby, you're so super-supremely-ba-ba-di-oh)
(Du-du-du, du-du-du)
(Du-du-du-du-du)
You're so ooh (You're so), you're so ah (You're so)
You're so cool (Baby, you're so super-supremely-ba-ba-di-oh)
(Du-du-du, du-du-du) Oh yeah
(Du-du-du-du-du)
You're so ooh (You're so), you're so ah (You're so)
You're so cool (Baby, baby, yeah)
(Du-du-du, du-du-du) Oh yeah
(Du-du-du-du-du)
You're so ooh (You're so), you're so ah (You're so)
You're so (Yeah)
(Du-du-du, du-du-du)
(Du-du-du-du-du)
You're so ooh, you're so ah
You're so cool
(Du-du-du, du-du-du)
