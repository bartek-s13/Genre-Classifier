I ain't cutting my hair till the good lord comes
I ain't cutting my hair till the good lord comes
I ain't cutting my hair till the good lord comes
Arrive upon the mountain just to see what we have done
I ain't cutting my hair, cutting till the good lord comes
I ain't open my eyes till we all walk free
I ain't open my eyes till we all walk free
I ain't open my eyes till we all walk free
Till the color of our skin it don't mean a damn thing
I ain't open my eyes, open till we all walk free
I ain't pickin' up a paper till the wild wind blows
I ain't pickin' up a paper till the wild wind blows
I ain't pickin up a paper till the wild wind blows
Till we should say what we should say, till we know what we should know
I ain't pickin up a paper, pickin till the wild wind blows
Cause it's a coal, it's a coal war
It's a coal, coal, it's a coal war
I ain't cuttin' my hair till the good Lord comes
Arrive upon the mountain just to see what we have done
I ain't cuttin' my hair, cuttin' till the good Lord comes
Till the good Lord comes
Cause it's a coal, it's a coal war
It's a coal, coal, coal
If we don't walk free with hand in heart, it's time
If we cannot see all we destroy, we're blind
It's not the hand that cuts, it's the heart we left behind
It's not the hand that cuts, it's the hatred deep inside
It's not the hand that cuts, it's the hatred deep inside
It's not the hand, not the hand
Five dollars and a head to keep
With dull black scissors and some kerosene
You burnt the house but you came to bid him well
Oh
What a thing to tell, put poison in the well
Just to say
Just to say
Just to say
Just to say
I ain't cuttin' my hair till the good Lord comes
Ain't cuttin' my hair till the good Lord comes
I ain't cuttin' my hair till the good Lord comes
Arrive upon the mountain just to see what we have done
I ain't cuttin' my hair, cuttin' till the good Lord comes
=======
I ain't cutting my hair till the good lord comes
I ain't cutting my hair till the good lord comes
I ain't cutting my hair till the good lord comes
Arrive upon the mountain just to see what we have done
I ain't cutting my hair, cutting till the good lord comes
I ain't open my eyes till we all walk free
I ain't open my eyes till we all walk free
I ain't open my eyes till we all walk free
Till the color of our skin it don't mean a damn thing
I ain't open my eyes, open till we all walk free
I ain't pickin' up a paper till the wild wind blows
I ain't pickin' up a paper till the wild wind blows
I ain't pickin up a paper till the wild wind blows
Till we should say what we should say, till we know what we should know
I ain't pickin up a paper, pickin till the wild wind blows
Cause it's a coal, it's a coal war
It's a coal, coal, it's a coal war
I ain't cuttin' my hair till the good Lord comes
Arrive upon the mountain just to see what we have done
I ain't cuttin' my hair, cuttin' till the good Lord comes
Till the good Lord comes
Cause it's a coal, it's a coal war
It's a coal, coal, coal
If we don't walk free with hand in heart, it's time
If we cannot see all we destroy, we're blind
It's not the hand that cuts, it's the heart we left behind
It's not the hand that cuts, it's the hatred deep inside
It's not the hand that cuts, it's the hatred deep inside

Ain't cuttin' my hair till the good Lord comes
I ain't cuttin' my hair till the good Lord comes
Arrive upon the mountain just to see what we have done
I ain't cuttin' my hair, cuttin' till the good Lord comes
