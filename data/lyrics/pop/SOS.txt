I'm an indecisive mess who stays up way too late most nights
I'm the girl who acts so sane, but thinks of you when I cry
And I know I keep on joking 'bout being emotionally unstable
But it's 2AM and I can't get my head out of this table
By the next day, I'll just swipe away the remnants of time
Now I'm ready to laugh at your shitty jokes and pretend to smile

I'm calling SOS, waiting for your rescue
Only problem is I'm good at hiding all my issues
I'm calling SOS, I'm calling SOS

I'm the happy girl that's laughing all damn day when I'm around you
When I'm alone, I'm calling SOS, waiting for your rescue
But it's nothing you can see because I'm so damn good at lying
Just another night I'll be up late, waiting for new lighting

I'm calling SOS, waiting for your rescue
Only problem is I'm good at hiding all my issues
I'm calling SOS, I'm calling SOS

So good at lying, so good at hiding
So good at lying, so good at hiding
I'm calling SOS, I'm calling SOS
The only problem is I'm good at hiding all my issues
I'm calling SOS, waiting for your rescue
Only problem is I'm good at hiding all my issues
I'm calling SOS, I'm calling SOS
