I saw your tear fall from your grace
I fell in love
I saw that fear when you showed me that kiss
We fell in love
I'll play this song for you
I'll play this song for you

Mmm, I make mistakes
Mmm, I know things break
Hear me love you
Let me love you
Ooh, I'll lay you down
I feel you now

All my lives I've seen, I'm thankful for this
'Cause you're my favorite place to bleed
Bleed for me
All these ways I've been, oh, I'm thankful for them
Mmm, you bleed for me, bleed for me
Why don't you tell me what you need?
Oh, what you need, oh, what you need

I feel your heart pain, I feel your pain
I feel your heart, baby, I feel your pain
I feel your heart, baby, I feel your pain
I feel your heart, baby, I feel your pain
I feel your heart, baby, I feel your pain
Why don't you tell me what you need?
I feel your heart, baby, I feel your pain
I feel your heart, baby, I feel your pain
I feel your heart, baby, I feel your pain
