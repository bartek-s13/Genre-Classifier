<<<<<<< HEAD
I remember roses in the garden
And my mother walking with her tray
I was washing our car with my brother
It was a lazy sunny Saturday

From our house, dear Edith sang
And I felt she's singing to me
And at that moment I knew

I was feeling tired
From the silence and the daily trends
Wanted to feel inspired
From the voices I heard in my head
I was whistling to myself
A little mellow and dark melody
And I wished to be heard

Sitting on the shoulders of my father
We were listening to a classic tune
He'd hold me a mirror to his mother
And in the water with the light of the moon

I was looking at that young girl
And I felt she's singing to me
And at that moment I knew

I was feeling tired
From the silence and the daily trends
Wanted to feel inspired
From the voices I heard in my head
I was whistling to myself
A little mellow and dark melody
And I wished to be heard

I was feeling tired
From the silence and the daily trends
Wanted to feel inspired
From the voices I heard in my head

I was feeling tired
From the silence and the daily trends
Wanted to feel inspired
From the voices I heard in my head
I was whistling to myself
A little mellow and dark melody
