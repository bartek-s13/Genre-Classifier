Let-let go, let-let-let go
Let-let go, let-let-let go

I know what you wanna, you wanna have some fun
Burn all this money, always be on the run, run
You know what I wanna, I wanna have some fun
Burn all this money, always be on the run, run

Leave all behind, live and let die
Love is a tough companion
Easy to leave it hanging

You and I could go where no one goes
Let-let go, let-let-let go
Load the LaFerrari, leave the show
Let-let go, run and let go
Start a riot, light a fire
I stand by you if you want it, oh
You and I could go where no one goes
Let-let go, let-let-let go

Let-let go, let-let-let go
Let-let go, let-let-let go
Fuck, fuck, I no longer give a fuck (fuck)
Sick of the drama, everything 'bout this sucks, sucks

Leave all behind, live and die
Love is a tough companion
Easy to leave it hanging

You and I could go where no one goes
Let-let go, let-let-let go
Load the LaFerrari, leave the show
Let-let go, run and let go
Start a riot, light the fire
I stand by you if you want it, oh
You and I could go where no one goes
Let-let go, let-let-let go

Let-let go, let-let-let go
Let-let go, let-let-let go

La-la-la-la-di-da, la-la-la-la-di-da
La-la-la-la-di-da, let go and run away
La-la-la-la-di-da, la-la-di-da-di-da
La-la-la-la-di-da, let go and run away
You and I could go where no one goes
Let-let go, let-let-let go
Load the LaFerrari, leave the show
Let-let go, run and let go
Start a riot, light the fire
I stand by you if you want it, oh
You and I could go where no one goes
Let-let go, let-let-let go
