Your figure's gaze
Reflection's burn
Lips sewn silent
Sewn tightly shut
Your figure's gaze
My shadow's scorn
Rip at the pieces
Feeding the cut
Spreading the wound
Forget the pain
Your figure's gaze
Burning with passion
Reaching the end
Screaming for more
Spreading the wound
Screaming for more
Fixated upon a figure
