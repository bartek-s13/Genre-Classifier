<<<<<<< HEAD
Kiss me on my back
Tell me all your fears
'Cause the rush of love is gone and
I'm tryna' find out why
It disappeared
Why it disappeared

I looked you in the eyes
Don't feel nothing here
'Cause the feeling of the love
That I used to have
Yeah, that shit's disappeared
Yeah, that shit's disappeared

Yeah, that shit's disappeared
Yeah, that shit's disappeared
Yeah, that shit's disappeared

Do you remember?
Our love in November?
That shit was so real
But there's patches on my fingers that won't heal
There's patches on my fingers that won't feel
Why'd you have to fucking disappear?
Why'd you have to fucking disappear?
Why'd you disappear?
Why'd you disappear?
Why'd you disappear?
Why'd you disappear?

Please come back
Please come back
Please come back
