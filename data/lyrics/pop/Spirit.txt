You're the lighthouse in my ocean
It's so far from me
When every time you beam your light
Free me

I believe if we think like a mountain
Our love never dies
If the wave is high enough in the ocean
We never turn to lies

You're the spirit of our love
The spirit of our love
The spirit of our love
The spirit of our love
The spirit of our
Love, love, love, love
The spirit of our
Love, love, love, love
The spirit of our
Love, love, love, love
The spirit of our love...

I was a blind man sarrow shout in the dark
You found me
Like a shadow trapped in another time
You released me
I believe if we think like a mountain
Our love never dies
If the wave is high enough in the ocean
We never turn to lies

We are the spirit of our love
The spirit of our love
The spirit of our love
The spirit of our love
We are the spirit of our love
The spirit of our love
The spirit of our love
The spirit of our love
The spirit of our
Love, love, love, love
The spirit of our
Love, love, love, love
The spirit of our
Love, love, love, love
The spirit of our love...
The spirit of our
Love, love, love, love
The spirit of our
Love, love, love, love
The spirit of our
Love, love, love, love
The spirit of our love
