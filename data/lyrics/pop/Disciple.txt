You flourish in your disciples bringing you pleasure in so many masturbative ways
Until you've simply no use for them anymore, and then they will remain and suffer in your concentrated haze
Devotion you seek from them is the starvation and abolishment of their little souls
But you escape all responsibility in that because of course you were the one (yeah, of course) who was hurt more

All the ones who dared to cross paths seen your rabid dog bait, mm-mm
And it's funny how it's always the same old familiar story

You no longer hold that power
You're letting in a man gone sour
It's too bad you ever let me in

Everyone around you, they're sick, they're on medication or they will finally lose their minds
They will always defend you and justify insanity like I did because you make them blind

Tell me, were you honing in on me or my protection? Oh, ooh
Because you considered I'd make a really good disciple, o-oh

You no longer hold that power
You're renting, how was I for the hour?
It's too bad you're not who you were back then

Tell me, were you honing in on me or my protection? Oh, ooh
Because you considered I'd make a really good disciple

You no longer hold that power
Took me awhile, but I have your number
It's too bad I gave you myself then

You tell them that you're thinking about letting me back in
That I really want you, but you're not sure yet
Are you insane?
I think you'd better get help
