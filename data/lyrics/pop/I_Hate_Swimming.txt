I’m six feet underneath the sea
I'm not upset or annoyed about anything
I’m just feeling a little bit paranoid
I don’t go swimming very often cause I know

The worst things that could happen to me
A shark bite, lose an arm, or forget to breathe
Aren’t you scared that there is something on your feet
Could be a fish with those bright, big, pointy teeth

I’m six feet underneath the sea
It’s no secret that I’m so scared I just peed
From the fish and all the live things underneath
They look like dinosaurs that can swim faster than me

The worst things that could happen to me
Maybe a shark bite, lose an arm, or forget to breathe
Aren’t you scared that there is something on your feet
Could be a fish with those bright, big, pointy teeth

Get me out (ahhh), help me out
Get me out (ahhh), help me out
Get me out (ahhh), help me out
Get me out (ahhh), help me out
Get me out (ahhh), help me out
Get me out (ahhh), help me out
