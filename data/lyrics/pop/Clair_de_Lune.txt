Don't go, tell me that the lights won't change
Tell me that you'll feel the same
And we'll stay here forever
Don't go, tell me that the lights won't change
Tell me that it'll stay the same
Where we're going, where we
Where we're going, where we're going
Where we're going, where we're going
Where we're going

Where we're going, where we
Where we're going, where we
Where we're going, where we
Where we're going, where we're going
Where we're going, where we
Where we're going, where we
Where we're going, where we
Where we're going, where we're going
Where we're going, where we
Where we're going, where we
Where we're going, where we
Where we're going, where we're going
Where we're going, where we
Where we're going, where we
Where we're going, where we
Where we're going, where we're going

Don't go, tell me that the lights won't change
Tell me that you'll feel the same
And we'll stay here forever
Don't go, tell me that the lights won't change
Tell me that it'll stay the same
Where we're going, where we
Where we're going, where we're going
Where we're going, where we're going
Where we're going

If I would know you, would you know me?
If I would know you, would you know me?
If I would know you, would you know me?
If I would know you, would you know me?

Don't go, tell me that the lights won't change
Tell me that we'll stay the same
Where we're going, where we
Where we're going, where we're going
Where we're going, where we're going
Where we go
