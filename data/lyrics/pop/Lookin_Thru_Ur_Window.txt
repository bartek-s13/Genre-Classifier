Who is that, gazing through your window?
It's the boy you're looking for, or maybe he's looking for you
Who is that peeking through your backdoor?
It's the boy you're looking for, or maybe he's looking for you

Oh how you feel so close to me
When I'm looking through your window baby
It's only fantasy in dreams
When I'm looking through your window baby


Who is that, sneaking in your dreams, girl?
It's the boy you're dreaming of, or maybe he's dreaming of you
Who is that, seems to be around you?
It's the boy you're thinking of, or maybe he's thinking of you

Oh how you feel so close to me
When I'm looking through your window baby
It's only fantasy in dreams
