Crash fast, body hijack
Falling like an airplane
Full speed is more than enough
Slow it down or we're done for

You lie awake and I can't sleep there
Storms pass, though we couldn't see that

On the way up, we forgot to slow down
Take it easy, take it easy
Too high, high, if we take it too high
I'll be losing you, I could lose me too

Black sky, keeping it light
All the time you stay away
Cold here, it's never enough
Cooling down till we're done for

You lie awake and I can't sleep there
Cry, laugh, no we couldn't keep that

Tell me you want the same thing, let's make it easy
Go on, give it all you've got (got, got, got, got)
Living on the same time, we need to take it slowly
And go and give it all you've got (got, got, got, got)

On the way up, we forgot to slow down
Take it easy, take it easy
Too high, high, if we take it too high
I'll be losing you, I could lose me too
