We can make it through these hard times
Dance our tears away
We can find our way in to the light
Dance our tears away
When everything just falls apart
We all stumble in the dark
And you feel out of place
Let's dance our tears away
Dance our tears away
Let's dance our tears away
Woa, woa, woa, dance our tears away
Woa, so what do you say?
Woa, let's dance our tears away
We can rise when we are beaten down
Dance our tears away
We can turn it all around
Dance our tears away
When everything just falls apart
We all stumble in the dark
And you feel out of place
Let's dance our tears away
Let's dance our tears away, woa, woa, woa
Dance our tears away, woa, woa, woa
Let's dance our tears away
Let's dance our tears away, woa, woa, woa
Dance our tears away, woa, woa, woa
Let's dance our tears away
Dance our tears away, woa
So what do you say? woa
Let's dance our tears away
