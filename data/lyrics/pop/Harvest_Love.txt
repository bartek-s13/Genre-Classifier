Harvest your love, harvest your love, for me
I'll lay it down, I'll lay it down, slowly
Put your hands on my face
At an orderly pace
I see
Put your love in the sand
As it makes no demands
I believe, I believe

But you keep on rolling
On a rolling stone
And you fight until the finish line
Carries you home
Carries you home

I had a plan, I had a plan you see
It was based on the rules that my mother and father taught me
Press the iron when it's hot
And you jump right in
Because the unfed mind devours itself
Water your garden
Water your garden
Water your garden
But you keep on rolling
On a rolling stone
And you fight until the finish line
Carries you home, home
Carries you home, home

Carry me, carry me
Carry me home
