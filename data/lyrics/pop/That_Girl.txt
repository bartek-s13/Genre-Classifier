There's a girl, but I let her get away
It's all my fault 'cause pride got in the way
And I'd be lying if I said I was okay
About that girl, the one I let get away

I keep saying no
This can't be the way it was supposed to be
I keep saying no
There's gotta be a way to get you close to me

(Now I know you gotta) speak up if you want somebody
Can't let them get away, oh no
You don't wanna end up sorry
The way that I'm feeling everyday
(Don't you know)
No, no, no, no
There's no home for the broken heart
(Don't you know)
No, no, no, no
There's no home for the broken

There's a girl, but I let her get away
It's my fault 'cause I said I needed space
And I've been torturing myself night and day
About that girl, the one I let get away
I keep saying no
This can't be the way it was supposed to be
I keep saying no
There's gotta be a way to get you
There's gotta be a way to get you
Close to me
(You gotta) speak up if you want somebody
Can't let them get away, oh no
You don't wanna end up sorry
The way that I'm feeling everyday
(Don't you know)
No, no, no, no
There's no home for the broken heart
(Don't you know)
No, no, no, no
There's no home for the broken

No home for me (no)
No home cause I'm broken
No room to breathe (no)
And I got no one to blame
No home for me (no)
No home 'cause I'm broken
About that girl
The one I let get away

So you better
Speak up if you want somebody
You can't let them get away, oh no no
You don't wanna end up sorry, oh no
The way that I'm feeling everyday
(Don't you know)
No, no, no, no
There's no home for the broken heart
(Don't you know)
No, no, no, no
There's no home for the broken
Oh
You don't wanna lose that love
It's only gonna hurt too much
(I'm telling you)
You don't wanna lose that love
It's only gonna hurt too much
(I'm telling you)
You don't wanna lose that love
Cause there's no hope for the broken
About that girl
The one I let get away
