Mr Right (Riva taylor/Jonathan Quarmby)
Verse 1
Music is my Mr Right
He’ll always be there by my side
He breaks my heart but treats me kind
We’re in time, we’re in time
Verse 2
Music is my oldest friend
He takes me dancing most weekends
He makes me move and keeps me high
Beating time, beating time
Pre
I never have to say I’m sorry
I never wanna say goodbye
I never gotta hope that he won’t make it home
I never need to fake it with Mr Right no
Chorus
I’ve got that rhythm in me
That monophonic melody
Don’t need no harmony
Cos music brings me back to life music is Mr
V3
Break up songs are playing loud
Cos people always let you down
They become someone like you
Yeh it’s true, yeh it’s true
Pre
He’ll never have say that he’s sorry
He’s never gonna tell me lies
He’s never gonna end up some man that I don’t know
I’ll never have to fake it with Mr Right, no
Chorus
I’ve got that rhythm in me
That monophonic melody
Don’t need no harmony
Cos music brings me back to life music is my Mr Right
I’ve got that song in me
My soul’s humanity
It’s all the love I need
Cos music brings me back to life Music is my Mr Right
Mid
Every sound every sound every sound every sound that we’re making
Every lie every lie every lie every lie will be true
Every note every note every note every note’s gonna play in tune
Music is my Mr Right
I’ve got that rhythm in me
That monophonic melody
Don’t need no harmony
Cos music brings me back to life
Said music is my Mr
Chorus
I’ve got that rhythm in me
That monophonic melody
Don’t need no harmony
