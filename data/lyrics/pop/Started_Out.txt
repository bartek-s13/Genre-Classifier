When we started out, I never believed it
I was so hopeless when it hit, I couldn't keep up with you

I don't wanna lose you
I don't wanna lose you
Wanna lose you
(I don't wanna lose you)

When we started out, I never believed it
I was so hopeless when it hit, I couldn't keep up with you
Then we were trying aimlessly to always achieve it (Achieve it)
Not working out
Back when we started out, I never could conceive it
But I tough up myself now
Kick down the heartache
'Cause when we started
I don't wanna lose you, wanna lose you
Be wicked and bold now
Tough up yourself now
Don't be going off the rails now
Kick down the heartache
'Cause when we started

We are wicked young fools who behave now
Back in the arms of somebody who saved us
We are wicked young fools who behave now
Back in the arms of somebody who saved us
We are wicked young fools who behave now
Back in the arms of somebody who saved us
We are wicked and bold
We are wicked and bold
We are wicked and bold
We are wicked and bold
We are wicked young fools who behave now
Back in the arms of somebody who saved us
We are wicked young fools who behave now
Back in the arms of somebody who saved us
We are wicked young fools who behave now
Back in the arms of somebody who saved us
We are wicked and bold
We are wicked and bold
We are wicked and bold
We are wicked and bold

(I don't wanna lose you, wanna lose you)

When we started out, I never believed it, believed it
I was so hopeless when it hit, I couldn't keep up with you, you (I don't wanna lose you)
Then we were trying aimlessly to always achieve it (Achieve it)
It's not working out
Back when we started out, I never conceived it
But I tough up myself now
Kick down the heartache
'Cause when we started
Back when we started out, I never believed it
Believed it
