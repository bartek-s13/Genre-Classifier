I got something on my mind
But words, they won't do it justice
I could write it on a sign
But words, they won't do it justice

I need a translator at the tip of my tongue
There's a freight train of emotion stuck in my lung
I need to get it out, get it out before it's all gone
So I'll just speak in vowels from now on

A-A
O-O
E-E
Ooh-ooh-ooh
A-A
O-O
E-E
Ooh-ooh-ooh

I could tell you what it's like
But words, they won't do it justice
Spell it out, turn up the mic
But words, they won't do it justice
I need a psychic to read my mind
Get me a Shakespeare to feed me lines
I need to let it out, let it out, I waited too long
I'm only using vowels from now on

A-A
O-O
E-E
Ooh-ooh-ooh
A-A
O-O

Ooh-ooh-ooh

Ahh-ahh-ahh
Ahh-ahh-ahh
