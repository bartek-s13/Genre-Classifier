Inside this fort there is nothing, nothing to do
It's cold outside, it's warm in here
I stare at you
And did you ever really lead me on?
Well I can't read that stuff
Oh, I can't read that stuff
And did I ever really mean to leave you behind?
Well I'm far away right now
So far away by now
I don't mind
But you left me a letter and I don't know why
I don't mind
I almost forgot that I hope you're alright
(You)
(But you've)
Done nothing wrong
I can't blame it all on you
(But you've)
Done nothing wrong
I can't blame it all
Did it ever even cross your mind?
That you might've hurt me too
But I couldn't tell you that back then (yeah)
Did I  ever even leave you behind?
I didn't think you cared
