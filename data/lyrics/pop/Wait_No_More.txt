I'm ready for the journey to your mind
I'm looking for the dreams that could be mine
I'm not surprised whenever I'm looking for a friend
Just like a joke that I can't understand
This time I feel that you will be the passage to the light
Just like the moon that is so bright tonight
I'm dreaming of you standing there and waiting
I hope you are there and you'll be there till the end
I'm not surprised whenever I'm looking for a friend
Just like a joke that I can't understand
This time I feel that you will be the passage to the light
Just like the moon that is so bright tonight
I'm in heaven when you are with me
I found the dream that I was looking for
Your sun shines when you are with me
But you can stand up and wait no more
