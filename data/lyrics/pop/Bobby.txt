Bobby was fourteen when she knew
Nothing would last
Wishing her life wouldn't be this bad
'Cause Bobby always thought like this with her thought of having missed
Every little thing life could bring she dismissed
'Cause Bobby always saw the bad onto the life she had
Who could have blamed the girl
Bobby was fourteen years old, Bobby was fourteen years old
Bobby was fourteen when she knew
Nothing would last
Wishing her mind didn't think so sad
'Cause Bobby always had a stitch on the left side of her wrist
Despite the love she'd get she dismissed
'Cause Bobby always saw the bad onto the life she had
Who could have blamed the girl
Bobby was fourteen years old, Bobby was fourteen years old
And Bobby knew if she'd ended it all it would be better soon
And if she tried, she would've missed out being happy and be a fool
But deep down bobby knew she'd find someone like you
Bobby was fifteen when she knew
Something's would last
Wishing her mind never thought that bad
'Cause bobby still had the stitch on the left side of her wrist
She got all life could give that she'd missed
