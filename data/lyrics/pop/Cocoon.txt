Eh-ah, eh-ah, eh-ah, eh-oh
Eh-ah, eh-ah, oh
Eh-ah, eh-ah, eh-ah, eh-oh
Eh-ah, eh-ah, oh

I know that you must feel like facing
With ruin, facing with ruin
I messed it up as always, I'm afraid of losing, I'm afraid of losing
I made you thinking oh so wrong
I made you feeling the worst
And I don't how to get along
With myself when I'm weakened
When I'm weakened

So let's go back to our cocoon
On the blackened afternoon
I see your heart is bleeding too
Let me bleed instead of you
So let's go back to our cocoon
On the blackened afternoon
I see your heart is bleeding too
Let me bleed instead of you
Let me bleed, let me bleed
Eh-ah, eh-ah
Let me bleed, let me bleed
Eh-ah, eh-ah
Instead of you

I've been always playing
Solid as I'm waving, solid as I'm waving
So I became a liar, I've been underrating
Overestimated
I made it really hard for you
Hard for you to love me
But there's so many things we could do
And all we need is escaping, escaping

So let's go back to our cocoon
On the blackened afternoon
I see your heart is bleeding too
Let me bleed instead of you
So let's go back to our cocoon
On the blackened afternoon
I see your heart is bleeding too
Let me bleed instead of you
Let me bleed, let me bleed
Eh-ah, eh-ah
Let me bleed, let me bleed
Eh-ah, eh-ah
Instead of you

Eh-ah, eh-ah, oh
Eh-ah, eh-ah

So let's go back to our cocoon
On the blackened afternoon
I see your heart is bleeding too
Let me bleed instead of you
So let's go back to our cocoon
On the blackened afternoon
I see your heart is bleeding too
Let me bleed instead of you
Let me bleed, let me bleed
Let me bleed, let me bleed
Let me bleed, now I will bleed
Instead of you
