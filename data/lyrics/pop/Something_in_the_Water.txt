There's something in the water, calling my name
Too deep to hear, no idea
The message you sent, well it ain't clear
Cause I've fallen in love again, yes I've fallen in love again
With you, with you, with you

I'm holding on to the past, my mother says I'm growing up fast
Oh time is gone with a blink
It's time to think and put your worries aside
Today is just today and tomorrow never dies
So never live on a regret
Take every moment you get and actions speak louder than words
So shout to the sky if your words can not be heard

Something in the water, calling my name
Too deep to hear, no idea
The message you sent, well it ain't clear
Cause I've fallen in love again, yes I've fallen in love again
With you, with you, with you

I'm wondering why my thoughts aren't clear
Am I hiding behind a crystal tear
Will the time stop before the dime drops
Will my foot print make the mark
Well I can see the light now as I'm stepping out the dark

There's something in the water, calling my name
Too deep to hear, no idea
The message you sent, well it ain't clear
Cause I've fallen in love again, yes I've fallen in love again
