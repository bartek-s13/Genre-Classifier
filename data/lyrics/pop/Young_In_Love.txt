I used to think it's funny
How you go from black to white
And now I think it's funny
Where are you tonight?
Just a boy with a knife
You were staring right at my heart
So you make a start
Just as i'm making it

(did you forget) that you opened up to her
(did you forget) that you opened up to her

Cause we once were in love
And I once was all yours
We were once young, we were once young
We were once young, we were once young in love
In love, in love, in love

You are a mean boy
Lucky you keep mostly to yourself
You didn't want to be kind or accept any help
Dark is the color of your heart
Is that why you locked it up?
(did you forget) that you opened up to her
(did you forget) that you opened up to her

Cause we once were in love
And I once was all yours
We were once young, we were once young
We were once young, we were once young in love
In love, in love, in love

So bad, so sad
Ain't nobody ever coming back
So bad, so sad
Ain't nobody ever fallin' in love
In love, in love, in love
Cause we once were in love
And I once was all yours
Cause we once were in love
And I once was all yours
