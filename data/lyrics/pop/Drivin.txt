<<<<<<< HEAD
(Chorus)
Driving around the city with my head down low, low
I see trouble up ahead and 2 ways to go, go
One will bring tears to my baby's eyes and do you hear them angels cry singing
You are not alone
You are not alone
Can anybody hear me? Is anybody out there?
Can anybody hear me? Is anybody out there?
(Verse)
Left lane, eyes low cause I'm nauseous
Right now I'm lost, driftin away in the darknes
Echo, Echo
Echo, Echo
I got the devil in my blood stream and I'm so high but it just won't go away (Just won't go away). Too much stress. My hands keep shaking, death knocking on my chest, I can't let it rest. Flashing lights down the road, feel like there's nothing here left that can save my soul. I hope they playing my songs when I'm dead and I'm gone cause I don't know if I'mma make it home (so now I'm just)
(Chorus)
Driving around the city with my head down low, low
See trouble up ahead and 2 ways to go, go
One will bring tears to my baby's eyes and do you hear them angels cry singing
You are not alone
You are not alone
Can anybody hear me? Is anybody out there?
