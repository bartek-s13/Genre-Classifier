<<<<<<< HEAD
{Verse 1}
Is it your heart or my heart
Beating like a bass drum
Don't let our skin be apart
For any other reason
When we're laying in your car
Chewing on the same gum
Still we try and figure it out
Even if it's dumb
{Pre-chorus}
(But) tell me
Why me
Just hold me
And tell me
{Chorus}
Emma, Emma, Emma, am I gonna lose you
Emma, Emma, Emma, am I gonna lose you
Emma, Emma, Emma, am I gonna lose you
Emma, Emma, Emma, am I gonna lose you
{Verse 2}
I get lost when I'm nervous
I swear I'm just trying to please you
But in my head it's a circus
I hope you know that I need you
Am I thinking too much
Locked in my mind
Tell me am I really enough
Cause I don't wanna fall behind
{Pre-chorus}
Just tell me
Why me
Just hold me
And tell me
{Chorus}
Emma, Emma, Emma, am I gonna lose you
Emma, Emma, Emma, am I gonna lose you
Emma, Emma, Emma, am I gonna lose you
Emma, Emma, Emma, am I gonna lose you
{Bridge}
Wait for me
Wait for me
Wait for me
Just wait for me
Wait for me
Wait for me
{Outro}
Emma, Emma, Emma, am I gonna lose you
Emma, Emma, Emma, am I gonna lose you
Emma, Emma, Emma, am I gonna lose you
Emma, Emma, Emma
