What the fuck did you expect me to do all along?
Every time that you were gone I had nothing going on
But I kept waiting, I kept waiting for your love
But I never knew, I never knew when you were coming home
So what you expect me to do without you here?
Without you here to let me love you
You think that I thought that you were alone all the time
But all you did was ever keep me waiting on the line
You never called back once, no you didn't
You never told me love would let you fully in this
I never knew that your love was ever fully in this
So tell me now, or I’m gonna leave this

What am I gonna do without you here?
'Cause I thought my heart was getting stronger
What am I gonna do without you here?
'Cause I thought my heart was getting stronger

I don’t think that I even fit in these little boxes
That you spend your time ticking
Ticking time has taken where you gone
I don't think that you're fully in this
So what you expect me to do all along?
Every time that you were gone I had nothing going on
So tell me, am I wrong, are you in it for the long run?
So tell me, am I wrong, are you in it for the long run?

What am I gonna do without you here?
'Cause I thought my heart was getting stronger, no
What am I gonna do without you here?
'Cause I'm sitting here

You never called back once, no you didn't
You never told me love would let you fully in this
I never knew that your love was ever fully in this
So tell me now, am I wrong, are you in it for the long run?
I don't think that I even fit in these little boxes
That you spend your time ticking
Ticking, ticking time has taken where you gone
I don’t think that you’re fully in this
