Sometimes I hate you
I wanna sleep in separate beds
But when I’m not with you
Can’t get you out of my head
Some days we’re useless
Something’s gotta give
But when you’re gone
I forget how to live

That is what love is
Isn’t it
That is what love is
Oh, isn’t it, isn’t it?
Even when it’s crazy
As crazy as can get
That is what love is
Gotta take what you can get

Sometimes you try to
Make me mad on purpose
Get under my skin
Cause’ you think that I deserve it
And I know my pride
Tends to get in the way
But somehow you forgive
And forget my mistakes

That is what love is
Isn’t it
That is what love is
Oh, isn’t it, isn’t it?
Even when it’s crazy
As crazy as can get
That is what love is
Gotta take what you can get

I hate when I think
It’s all just a mess
I’d keep to myself
If I thought we’d progress
And if it’s too much
I’d get if you’re stressed
But I put myself through too much
Just to suppress
But sometimes, sometimes I hate you
But that is what love is
Isn’t is
That is what love is
Oh, isn’t is, isn’t it?
Even when it’s crazy
As crazy as can get
That is what love is
