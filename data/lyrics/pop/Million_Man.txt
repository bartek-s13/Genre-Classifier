Everyday
Wake up with a hole in my head, I can't stand it
Everyday
Someone's crawling out of my bed, I didn't plan it

But it feels like I'm the only one for love
I pushed until you told me to jump
You don't have the words to talk, how to feel

I'm a million man
I will do when I can to get me on
For that million man
I will do what I can when we get home

Everyday, everyday, everyday
Wake up with a hole in my head, I can't stand it
Everyday, everyday
Someone's crawling out of my bed, I didn't plan it, I didn't plan it

But it feels like I'm the only one for love
I pushed until you told me to jump
You don't have the words to talk, how to feel
I'm a million man
I will do when I can to get me on
For that million man
I will do what I can when we get home

When we get home
In the morning
Clear your schedule
Cut them off and
When we get home
Through the garden
Let your friends know
Do you do this often?

You call me often with an honest question
No, I can't stand it (I can't stand it)
I can't stand it (I can't stand it)
I can't stand it (I can't stand it)
I can't stand, I can't do this again

I'm a million man
I will do when I can to get me on
For that million man
I will do what I can when we get home
When we get home
In the morning
Clear your schedule
Cut them off and
When we get home
Through the garden
Let your friends know
Do you do this often?
