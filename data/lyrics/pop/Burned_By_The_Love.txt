Trying to hold my head above water
But my feet are tired
So I rest to breath, quickly
Slip down away
Caught up in the violence of the waves
I must evade and try to find my space

You don't understand, it's hard to cruise on
Knowing it's right, but it feels so wrong
Still the choir plays on
They ain't singing our song

Sometimes I wish that we never got this far
Would've traded all my diamonds to be where you are
Just to sleep through the day and dance on through the dark
But it's like the air upped and left our lungs
Just like a balloon that's got no helium
Learned how to fly so high but got burned by the sun
And burned by the love

Waiting for the clouds to break in
Would you send down the rains
You know I ain't been patient
The paint is starting to flake and the fire keeps on raging
You still like pie, but my tastes are changing

You don't understand, it's hard to cruise on
Knowing it's right, but it feels so wrong
Still the choir plays on
They ain't singing our song

Sometimes I wish that we never got this far
Would've traded all my diamonds to be where you are
Just to sleep through the day and dance on through the dark
But it's like the air upped and left our lungs
Just like a balloon that's got no helium
Learned how to fly so high but got burned by the sun
And burned by the love
Sometimes I wish that we never got this far
Would've traded all my diamonds to be where you are
Just to sleep through the day and dance on through the dark
But it's like the air upped and left our lungs
Just like a balloon that's got no helium
Learned how to fly so high but got burned by the sun
And burned by the love
