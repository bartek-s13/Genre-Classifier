You so bad baby tell me why don't you
Come my way all I want to do is see your face
We can take it slow this ain't no race
But we can speed up if that's okay
Yeah, If that's okay
Every time you walk by, I just wanna put you on replay
See you walk by again
Baby you a ten
Can I be your man?
And we can just chill

We could take it slow
Baby, you already know it's the wintertime
Out early in the snow

Girl nothing lasts forever
But, baby I swear I can fuck you 'til whenever
Usually, I play, but I ain't playing whatsoever
However, we could do it how you want it
Girl, they don't want to sever
But we could do it better swear
I'ma keep tryin', I won't ever let up
My last girl, she was so damn fed up
Yeah, I swear every day she was telling me whatever
I'm tired of these hoes that be wanting me so perfect

When I get you I'ma rope you in like vanilla
Too fucking bad baby they a fashion killer
