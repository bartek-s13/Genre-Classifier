Verse 1
I just wanna wake, I just wanna wake up now
Get me out of this, get me out of this somehow
I took the pill, now I'm about to black out
I don't make mistakes but I'm in too deep to back out
Kiss me, kiss me quick the poison's burning up now
I can't feel a thing, I can't feel a thing, numbed out
I took the pill, now I'm about to black out
I don't make mistakes, I don't make mistakes
Pre-Chorus
You don't even know me but wanna watch me burn
Light me up, your cigarette
Watch me burn, no regret
All along they told me, 'You got a lot to learn'
Win or lose, I'll take it
Chorus
I don't wanna be your Champagne Supernova
I don't wanna be your Champagne Supernova
I don't wanna be your Champagne Supernova
I don't wanna be your Champagne Supernova
Verse 2
I followed the thrill, I followed the thrill, hooked now
Yeah you stole my heart, yeah you stole my heart, caught out
Holding my crown, 'cos I'm about to black out
I don't know myself, guess I'm far too weak to back out
Pre-Chorus
Kiss me, kiss me quick, the poison's burning up now
I can't feel a thing, I can't feel a thing, numbed out
I took the pill, now I'm about to black out
I don't make mistakes, I don't make mistakes
Chorus
I don't wanna be your Champagne Supernova
I don't wanna be your Champagne Supernova
I don't wanna be your Champagne Supernova
I don't wanna be your Champagne Supernova
Bridge
If I fail, make it glorious
I don't wanna die on my knees
Got me face down, I'm over it
I want out of this fantasy
Chorus
I don't wanna be your Champagne Supernova
I don't wanna be your Champagne Supernova
I don't wanna be your Champagne Supernova
