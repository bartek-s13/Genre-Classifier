<<<<<<< HEAD
Trying to hold my head up
I've been thinking about this mess we've made
'Cause I shouldn't have to blame myself
Took what was taught as gospel
But I don't have a clue where to go from here
'Cause I'm almost breaking, can't you tell?

I don't even understand why I'm still here
I just need a minute to go through with it
I don't even understand why I'm still here

I gave you my all, but you still want more
I thought you were proud, but it's not enough
Tried to sell me a lie that you thought I'd buy
But you don't decide, just thought I'd let you know ( aha, I'm not- aha, aha )
Just thought I'd let you know ( aha, I'm not- aha, aha )
Just thought I'd let you know

Not trying to play the victim
I just needed to get this off my chest
It feels like my senses have kicked in
I don't even understand why I'm still here
I just need a minute to go through with it
I don't even understand why I'm still here

I gave you my all, but you still want more
I thought you were proud, but it's not enough
Tried to sell me a lie that you thought I'd buy
But you don't decide, just thought I'd let you know ( aha, I'm not- aha, aha )
Just thought I'd let you know ( aha, I'm not- aha, aha )
Just thought I'd let you know ( aha, I'm not- aha, aha)
I gave you my all, but you still want more
I thought you were proud, but it's not enough
Tried to sell me a lie that you thought I'd buy
But you don't decide, just thought I'd let you know ( aha, I'm not- aha, aha )
Just thought I'd let you know ( aha, I'm not- aha, aha )
