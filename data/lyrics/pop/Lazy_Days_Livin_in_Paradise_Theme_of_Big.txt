Hey!
O-oh yeah!
Oh
Yeah, whoo!

Oh, it's a windy and sunny day
And I can hear the faint sound of distant waves
The past weeks have been going by so fast
It's all the same: the bright sky and shining sun
I have a feel it's gonna be a fun day
Oh, it's a windy and sunny day
The many summers and many great games
Guess it's another trouble-free day
Our playground's so huge; we don't know where it ends
Feels energetic and groovy—everything's cool; it's excellent

(Everyday's a new beginning, yeah)
We don't know who we're gonna meet today
(The more I want, the less that I can get)
Keep walking for a new tomorrow
(But I guess that I'm so happy now)
Gonna set my heart free
Now I've got nothing to worry me
Come on, let's just get up go, go, go, go!

Hey, big guy (Hey, little guy)
Can you tell me who came first?
(Sorry, but I don't know)
We are simply natural
Okay, all you have to do is sit up, look left, right, up, and down
Hey, big guy (Hey, little guy)
Can you tell me what's inside?
(Sorry, but I don't know)
We are simply natural
We present you with a gift. Welcome to our Paradise

(Hey!) Hey!
Come on!
{Piano Solo}
Oh yeah!
{Guitar Solo}
Whoo!

(What'd you think about the incident?)
You always take me for granted
(I am asking you as a first step)
You answer first 'cause I asked you first
(You and I are friends for all of time)
Tell me how you feel
But you know I can't resist that smiley face
Happy happy, muy amable!
