Here she come, her beauty irresistible
I know she bad news now you need to know
You'll never be nothing else but a stepping stone
I know you want her but if I was you
I wouldn't cuz I know what she can do
She'll eat your heart raw, no barbecue

She's a beast, it's too late, she calling, calling
She's a beast, and you're the bait, she calling, don't fall in love with a monster, cuz she'll chew you up, she'll chew you up, she'll chew you up
She's a beast, she calling, she calling
She's a beast (x3)

That girl so hot it can't be legal
She playing you, prey on you like an eagle
She evil, ff-ing 'round with your ego
Oh, ohh
Now you thinking you're the only one
But you gonna wish you never met her
Daddy told you don't go out with a loaded gun
Bang, bang
She's a beast, it's too late, she calling, calling
She's a beast, and you're the bait, she calling, don't fall in love with the monster, cuz she'll chew you up, she'll chew you up, she'll chew you up
She's a beast, she calling, she calling
She's a beast (x3)

She's a beast, it's too late
She's a beast, and you're the bait
She's a beast
She's a beast, it's too late (She's a beast)
