'Cause I'm tired of all this talking
'Cause everything you hear is empty words
But who am I, oh to say this
'Cause everything you hear is just words, yeah

You have to trust in someone, trust in someone, trust in someone
'Cause the truth is

'Cause all I need, is to see you blossom out, blossom out, blossom out
And all I feel, is that I need you to blossom out, blossom out, blossom out
And all I need, is to see you blossom out, blossom out, blossom out
And all I feel, is that I need you to blossom out, blossom out, blossom out

And I'm tired of constant sorrow
'Cause everything you get, is just worse
So what's the point, of going somewhere
When everyone you see, is just nothing but confused

You have to trust in someone, trust in someone, trust in someone
'Cause the truth is

'Cause all I need, is to see you blossom out, blossom out, blossom out
And all I feel, is that I need you to blossom out, blossom out, blossom out
And all I need, is to see you blossom out, blossom out, blossom out
And all I feel, is that I need you to blossom out, blossom out, blossom out

'Cause all I need, is to see you blossom out blossom out blossom out
And all I feel, is that I need you to blossom out blossom out blossom out
To blossom out, blossom out, blossom out
