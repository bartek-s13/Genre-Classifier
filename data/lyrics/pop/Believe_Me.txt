When he calls to me he calls at the right time
The right time
I never want for much, except for your time
For your time
I've never been alone before
'Til I was without you
And I never really sang before
'Til I sang about you
About you

Do you believe me now
I've written it all out
I'm loving more than I would ever allow
Do you believe me now

When I call for him I call at the wrong time
The wrong time
But he cares for me so he doesn't mind
No, he doesn't mind
I've never felt like this
So close to happiness
And I never thought you'd feel the same
But now I know it was always this way

Do you believe me now
I've written it all out
I'm loving more than I would ever allow
Do you believe me now
