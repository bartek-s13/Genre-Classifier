Of all the battles that I've won
They don't matter now you're gone
Nothing matters now you're gone
Of all the battles that I've won
They don't matter now you're gone
Nothing matters now you're gone

I said I'm done with you
But I can't help it when I lay down, still think of you
Keeps me awake at night and
Why do I let it get so far?
How do we end with broken hearts?
How do we end with broken hearts, broken hearts?

So was it really worth it?
Caught in the moment while we burn it down
No one's perfect
Try to connect and we turn it 'round
Well, I'm over this game
No one's taking the blame
So was it really worth it?
Was it really worth it?
Everything we've been criticizing
Well, I don't wanna live like that
Overthinking and analyzing
Never gonna take it back
I thought I was winning, but I was dying
Everything we never had
Losing you is what I want fighting

Of all the battles that I've won
They don't matter now you're gone
Nothing matters now you're gone
Of all the battles that I've won
They don't matter now you're gone
Nothing matters now you're gone

Well, you said you hated me
Tried to forget, but it stays with me
What scares me is when I'm locked up, got me feeling free
Does it come from the heart?
Words cut deep, cut deeper than scars
Thought that you were perfect, was it really worth it?

Everything we've been criticizing
Well, I don't wanna live like that
Overthinking and analyzing
Never gonna take it back
I thought I was winning, but I was dying
Everything we never had
Losing you is what I want fighting
Of all the battles that I've won
They don't matter now you're gone
Nothing matters now you're gone
Of all the battles that I've won
They don't matter now you're gone
Nothing matters now you're gone

I'm too proud to call you
But I'm still thinking of you
Oh, I think I love you (Ah)
I'm too proud to call you
But I'm still thinking of you
Oh, I think I love you (Ah)
I'm too proud to call you
But I'm still thinking of you
Oh, I think I love you (Ah)
I'm too proud to call you
But I'm still thinking of you
Oh, I think I love you (Ah)

Of all the battles that I've won
