You said Nick Cave was your favourite guy
I listened to his album, it made me cry
He was singing about killing her
I was thinking about killing her
I walked into your favourite bookstore
Pretended I was browsing and nothing more
But I was hoping I'd see you with her
I was hopin' I'd see you with her
And I may be obsessed with puppies and dogs
But it helps me from feeling depressed all the time
'Cause you only call me, at four in the morning
I don't hate her
I hate you
Its not her fault
This ones on you
And if you don't love her
Honestly
Then let her know
So its not on me
It's not on me
It's not on me
A vegan is what I pretended to be
Even got me a job at Mrs Flannery's
Just so I could be the girl of your dreams
And then I went on your facebook
To see if you're single
And accidentally liked something from 400 weeks ago
I'm so embarrassed
I played my first show and I saw you there
I got so nervous I fell off my chair
Why did you bring her
Why did you bring her there
I don't hate her
I hate you
Its not her fault
This ones on you
And if you don't love her
Honestly
Then let her know
So its not on me
Not on me
Not on me
And five years have passed
And we haven't spoken
And I heard that you guys have broken up
Oh well
