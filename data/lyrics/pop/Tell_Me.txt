Two wrongs don't make a right
I know I fucked up a couple times
But never like this no, but never like this no
Call me crying, all by yourself
Saying that you kissed somebody else
But it didn't mean nothing no
No it never means nothing

Tell me it's over
Tell me it's done
Tell me you love me, that I'm the one
Tell me where your heart lies
And I know where your heart lies
Are we together? Are we undone?
Thought we were forever, but maybe we're not
Tell me something I can hold on to
Just tell me!

Tell me tell me now
Tell me tell me now
Tell me tell me now
Just tell me!

Your words hurt like hell
Had to make a joke so you couldn't tell
That I'm dead on the inside
I'm still dead on the inside
I'm trying to move on cuz I said I would
I wrote a couple songs bout' the coulda should
But I'm so in love with you, and I don't know what to do

Tell me it's over
Tell me it's done
Tell me you love me, that I'm the one
Tell me where your heart lies
And I know where your heart lies
Are we together? Are we undone?
Thought we were forever, but maybe we're not
Tell me something I can hold on to
Just tell me!

Tell me tell me now
Tell me tell me now
Tell me tell me now
Just tell me!
Tell me tell me now
Tell me tell me now
Tell me tell me now
Just tell me!

I feel like I'm never getting through
Every little thing I do doesn't fix you messing up
But now it's up to you (Now it's up to you)
I just guess I thought that we'd be better
Have our shit together, tell me we're forever ever ever ever
All I want to do is lay down
Come on let the world weigh down

Tell me it's over
Tell me it's done
Tell me you love me, that I'm the one
Tell me where your heart lies
And I know where your heart lies
Are we together? Are we undone?
Thought we were forever, but maybe we're not (We're not)
Tell me something I can hold on to
Just tell me!

Tell me tell me now
Tell me tell me now
Tell me tell me now
Just tell me!
(Ahhh...!)
Tell me tell me now
Tell me tell me now
Tell me tell me now
Just tell me!
