<<<<<<< HEAD
Keeping her bright eyes focused on the coastline, waiting for you
Isn't she all of us pining for that last kiss
A permanent truth, a means to get through
Maybe we'll cry whilst hopeful when we think about the past being cruel
Got a thought for those who start to think of love
As the pursuit of a fool, it's a palace from ruin
Deep into the night, eyes closing
Heart swollen with my loving for you
A solid embrace, kind face
And then the hurt starts leaving the room, followed by goons
Sometimes it's open wide and lights the road at night
You've got a heart like the moon
Gather courage, if you're doing something, do it
'Cause she got to go soon

If I could now, I'd never tell you not to love her
However, leaving her a long way from her home
And that ain't no promise, cracking over time
A private corner of Roma
Don't shadow the light, wait, good love grown
If I could now, if I could now
If I could now, if I could now
If I had you now

So keeping bright eyes focused on the coastline waiting for you
Don't give me that bye-bye baby when the night moves into black from the blue
The nights you've been through
Just give me that wide smile made for putting songs into the hearts of the doomed
And catch a cold heart staring at the water, babe, remember you flew

If I could now, I'd never tell you not to love her
However, leaving her a long way from her home
And that ain't no promise, cracking over time
A private corner of Roma
Don't shadow the light, wait, good love grown
If I could now, if I could now
If I could now, if I could now

If I could now, I'd never tell you not to love her
However, leaving her a long way from her home
And that ain't no promise, cracking over time
A private corner of Roma
Don't shadow the light, wait, good love grown

So say what you want, dear
But the courage was won
With the way that you spoke here
