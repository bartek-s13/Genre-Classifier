(I need you back, I need you back)
(Mmm, even if you don't love me back)

If life was a movie, I'd be your favourite actor
You'd be my favourite scene, you'd be my favourite chapter
My eyes never left the screen since I saw you, the one that I been after
I could watch you over and over, filled my life with laughter
And if, life was a book, you'd be my favourite author
I'd read your words night and day
And I would never bother to leave
You're the only book I would read, yeah, yeah

And if life was a song, this would be my favourite song
I wrote this when you're gone, wonder when you're coming home
Or if you're coming home, you been gone hella long
And I'd been all alone, yeah, yeah
You used to be my comfort zone
Used to be my one and only one I wanna hold
Remember you would wanna hold me falling in my arms
So I fell for you
Foolish move that I fell for you

'Cause baby, yeah, I need you, I would never leave you
Wonder how you left me, you left me feeling empty
And I can't lie, you're see through, I cannot believe you
Even though you did me wrong for some reason I need you
And I can't lie, I miss you, I forgot them issues
How could you forget me when I couldn't forget you?
And baby, yeah, you're special, I could not forget you
Even when I tried, baby, I could not forget you
I can't lie, I miss you, I forgot them issues
How could you forget me when I couldn't forget you?
And baby, yeah, you're special, I could not forget you
Even when I tried, baby, I could not forget you

Girl, I want you
I need you back, I need you back (Girl)
Girl, I love you
Even if you don't love me back, don't love me back (Girl)
Girl, I want you
I need you back (Girl), I need you back, girl
I'm gon' love you
Even if you don't love me back, don't love me back

If life was a song, this would be my favourite song
I wrote this when you're gone, wonder when you're coming home
Or if you're coming home, you been gone hella long
