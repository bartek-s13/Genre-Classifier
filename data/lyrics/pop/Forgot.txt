Must've slipped your mind
Must've slipped your mind
Must've slipped your mind

I'm fine now that I'm without you
You burned me down, played me for a fool
Now you hit my line like everything is cool

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Baby, I don't got the time to remind you
That you'll never find no one as good as I was
Putting me through hell, you threw me in the fire
Must have slipped your mind, that I said "I'm done with you"

You must have forgot that I don't need you no more
Must have forgot that I caught you creeping on the low
Must have forgot that I'm better since I moved on
You must have forgot that I don't need you no more
Must have forgot that I caught you creeping on the low
Must have forgot that I'm better since I moved on

You must not remember (No)
You threw me in the fire (No)
Just to watch me burn (No)
Still think I should put you first (Must've slipped your mind)
Baby, I don't got the time to remind you
That you'll never find no one as good as I was
Putting me through hell, you threw me in the fire
Must have slipped your mind, that I said "I'm done with you"

(No, no, oh-oh)
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
(No, no, oh-oh)
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
(No, no, oh-oh)
Must've slipped your mind

You must have forgot that I don't need you no more
Must have forgot that I caught you creeping on the low
Must have forgot that I'm better since I moved on
You must have forgot that I don't need you no more
Must have forgot that I caught you creeping on the low
Must have forgot that I'm better since I moved on

(No, no, no, nooo
No, no, no, nooo
No, no, no, nooo)
