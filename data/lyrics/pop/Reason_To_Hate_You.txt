Can you just lie to me
And ruin these memories?
'Cause I've gotta forget somehow
So I'm begging you burn us to the ground

'Cause I know it's over but I don't know what to do
So help me get over, help me get over you

And tell me you love somebody else or something
Or say you've been unfaithful to me
'Cause I need a reason to hate you
A reason to let you go
A reason to move on
'Cause without one, I know I won't
So tell me you love somebody else or something
Or say you've been unfaithful to me

Where do we go from here?
Do you just disappear?
'Cause I don't think I can be your friend
When it feels like the break isn't gonna mend
Well I know it's over but I don't know what to do
So help me get over, help me get over you

And tell me you love somebody else or something
Or say you've been unfaithful to me
'Cause I need a reason to hate you
A reason to let you go
A reason to move on
'Cause without one, I know I won't
So tell me you love somebody else or something
Or say you've been unfaithful to me

'Cause even after all this time
I'm hoping I can change your mind
'Cause hope's the only open door left to choose
So lock me out for good because
I know that I'm not strong enough
To stop myself from feeling things for you
So don't give me the truth

Just tell me you love somebody else or something
Or say you've been unfaithful to me, yeah
'Cause I need a reason to hate you
A reason to let you go
A reason to move on
'Cause without one, I know I won't
So tell me you love somebody else or something
