(I've got Friday on my mind on a Sunday)
I’ve got Friday on my mind, mind, mind, mind, mind
I've got Friday on my mind on a Sunday
I've got Friday on my mind…

I’ve got Friday on my
Mind
I've got Friday on my
Mind
Mind
Mind

Here we are, here we are, here we are
The last ones standing
Here we are, here we are, here we are
The weekend's ended
Here we are, here we are, here we are
We never felt it
Here we are, here we are, here we are

I've got Friday on my mind, mind, mind, mind, mind
I've got Friday on my mind on a Sunday
I've got Friday on my mind, mind, mind, mind, mind
I've got Friday on my mind on a Sunday
I've got Friday on my mind…
I’ve got Friday on my
Mind
I’ve got Friday on my
Mind
Mind
