:
Last I saw you were down on your knees
Praying for some release
Check my bed but you ain't next to me
And I'm wondering where you ease
As dawn telling you one let you know
But I don't understand this game
Bit my lip but I said I would find
Something I didn't know I had
:
Almost winning and now I don't know
But it seems like it's almost away from me
Maybe one day I'll be strong enough
To find it out and I'll know it all
:
And the spring is running far
You got me thinking
Oh I want this to last
You got me thinking
:
Almost winning and now I don't know
But it seems like it's almost away from me
Maybe one day I'll be strong enough
To find it out and I'll know it all
:
Do you think it's easy now
Now alone
Baby is it easy now
Now alone
:
Almost winning and now I don't know
But it seems like it's almost away from me
Maybe one day I'll be strong enough
