<<<<<<< HEAD
Okay, I guess I'll pick it up right after the breakdown
She walks outta the crowd
Her vision's kinda cloudy
The Sudafeds are downs
The crowd cheered when she threw up her beer
Sat down and shook the sand from their shoes
Took of their suits and they started to move
To the light of the crescent moon
To the tune of the 2 Live Crew
We stepped out of the Jersey pines
Headed straight for the neon signs
And they like the way she types
Underneath the florescent lights
And she lives in the Brooklyn Heights
She came down on a Friday night
And they all wanna meet some guys
And we all wanna meet some guys
Friends like the beach patrol
They've got the muscles, you can hold the soul
She said she's waiting on the steady type
Then she disappears with the Eyepatch Guy
He stepped out of the neon signs
Headed straight for the Jersey pines
And she found something she likes
And she's alright but she almost died
And they all woke up at the airport
In the arcade at the western concourse
That's when she said that we should do this all over
She wipes the blood from her mouth with her shoulder
Said, "I just need a little diet cola
Or maybe just a little Lifter Puller
I'm sick and tired of being stranded by the subway trains
I deserve a little fuck up every once in awhile
I'm sick of being scared of falling off the side of my bed"
