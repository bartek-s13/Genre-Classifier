<<<<<<< HEAD
I've been stuck in motion
Moving too fast
Tryna catch a moment but it slips through my hands
All I see are long days and dark nights
I'm lost without you, but I'm on my way, so hold tight

I'm coming home tonight
Meet me in the valley where the kids collide into the morning
Oh my god, my town is coming alive (coming alive)
I'm coming home tonight, I know you're ready for the sparks to fly
Into the morning
Oh my god, my town is coming alive
'Cause I'm coming home tonight
'Cause I'm coming home tonight

Don't wanna spend my whole life catching my breath
'Cause I've been running 'round and 'round and 'round
And I've got nothing left
There's nothing like a sunset skyline
To let you know you're almost home
So breathe in, and hold tight

I'm coming home tonight
Meet me in the valley where the kids collide into the morning
Oh my god, my town is coming alive (coming alive)
I'm coming home tonight, I know you're ready for the sparks to fly
Into the morning
Oh my god, my town is coming alive
'Cause I'm coming home tonight
Yes, I'm coming home tonight

Time has a way of diluting emotions
But I won't let distance get in between us, no

Oh, I'm coming home tonight
Meet me in the valley where the kids collide into the morning
Oh my god, my town is coming alive (coming alive)
I'm coming home tonight, I know you're ready for the sparks to fly
Into the morning
Oh my god, my town is coming alive
Tonight
'Cause I'm coming home tonight

Oh, woah (oh, woah)
Oh, woah (oh, woah)
Oh, woah (oh, woah)
