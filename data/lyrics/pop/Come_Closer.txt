Go, go, go
Go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

Remember when a smile from a stranger
Could make you smile
Fresh breeze and your hands reaching higher
Felt like you touched the sky
We would play wild to the morning
We have stars in our eyes
No worries about the past or the future
Where were queens of the night, kings of the night
And she said

Hold tight don't ever let me go
Come closer
Feel my heart don't ever let me go
All I want is for you to come closer
Hold tight don't ever let me go
All I want is for you to come closer
Take my hand and never let me go
Go, go, go, go, go, go

Go, go, go, go, go, go

Hold tight don't ever let me go
All I want is for you to come closer
Take my hand and never let me go

Secrets yeah, nobody has to know
All the pain all we had to explore
All the things that we said
Things that we did, for us to be more than a fling
Nowadays, they're too busy
Being someone, they can never be
But we're here for the night
Young wild and free
Come fly away with me

Hold tight don't ever let me go
Come closer
Take my hand and never let me go

Wayo, wayo oh
Wayo, wayo oh
Hold tight don't ever let me go
Wayo, wayo oh
Feel my heart don't never letting go no
Oh yeah
Wayo, wayo oh
Wayo, oh yeah
Wayo, wayo oh
Wayo, wayo oh
Wayo, wayo oh
Wayo, wayo oh
Wayo, wayo oh
Wayo, wayo oh
Oh yeah
Wayo, wayo oh

Hold tight don't ever let me go
Come closer
Feel my heart don't ever let me go
All I want is for you to come closer
Hold tight don't ever let me go
All I want is for you to come closer
Take my hand and never let me go
Go, go, go, go, go, go
