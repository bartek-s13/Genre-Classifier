Wide awake, wide awake, it all gets so hard
Wide awake, wide awake, it all gets so hard, oh-oh
Will you take my hand and make a shadow?
Will you take my hand and make a shadow, oh-oh?

Little, I want to be a kid again
Little, don't tell me this is home

I'm only only in the only only in the in the shadows
I'm only only in the only only in the in the shadows
My heart is fire, my heart is young
I'm only only in the only only in the in the shadows

Runaway, runaway, let's sleep tomorrow
Runaway, runaway, let's sleep tomorrow, oh-oh
When the city floods we'll build our castle
When the city floods we'll build our castle, oh-oh

Little, I want to be a kid again
Little, don't tell me this is home
I'm only only in the only only in the in the shadows
I'm only only in the only only in the in the shadows
My heart is fire, my heart is young
I'm only only in the only only in the in the shadows

We (x8)
We gotta wait inside the shadow
Don't get old, don't get old
We gotta wait inside the shadow
Don't get old, don't get old
We gotta wait inside the shadow
Don't get old, don't get old
We gotta wait inside the shadow
Don't get old, don't get old

I'm only only in the only only in the in the shadows
I'm only only in the only only in the in the shadows
My heart is fire, my heart is young
