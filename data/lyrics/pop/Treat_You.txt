Why you gotta go?
You know I want it
Tell me what you know, boy

You know I want it
Tell me what you know but you never let it show

The way you touch my body
I'm so into you
No one does loving the way that we do
Boy I got you waiting, waiting up all night
You know that I treat you right (right, right, hey!)

You know that I treat you right
You know that I treat you
You know that I treat you right
You know that I treat you
