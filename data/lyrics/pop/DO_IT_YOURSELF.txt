You don’t need to get it up for me, I’m fine
Keep your “happy ever after“, it ain’t mine
Bubble gum, I chew you up and run
Bonnie could’ve had a good life without Clyde

Cover my ears like la la la la
Don’t wanna hear that I need a lover

I love myself like nobody else
Hands on, go on
Do it yourself
I touch myself like nobody else
Bigger, better
Do it yourself

Snow White, Beauty and the Beast, a bunch of lies
Girls ain’t gotta be the sweet and helpless type
Prince for sale, forget all fairy tales
I don’t need a man to save me, watch me fight

Cover my ears like la la la la
Don’t wanna hear that I need a lover
I love myself like nobody else
Hands on, go on
Do it yourself
I touch myself like nobody else
Bigger, better
Do it yourself

I love myself like nobody else
Do it yourself
I love myself like nobody else
Do it, do it, do it yourself

I love myself like nobody else
Hands on, go on
Do it yourself
I touch myself like nobody else
Bigger, better
Do it yourself
