Sorry I'm back with a vengeance
They all bow down in my presence
Yeah they know
You don't, you don't, you don't, you don't own me
Save you from your crime cause I'm winning
Try to keep me dead but I'm grinning
Now you know
You can't, you can't, you can't, you can't kill me

I'll be in the corner, sipping on my soda
Waiting for the moment you arrive
I'm your little nightmare, devil in disguise, yeah
Better watch your back, alright

I'm bad, bad, baby, bad, don't get mad
I am not your princess, stay out of my business
Bad, bad, baby, bad, don't get mad
I am not your princess, stay out of my business
Cause I'm ice cold and I don't play nice, no
If you come for me I'll eat you alive
Bad, bad, baby, bad, don't get mad
I am not your princess, stay out of my business

Sitting front row at Moschino
Won't look me in the eye, you're an asshole
That's just rude
You won't, you won't, you won't, you won't shame me
Busy doing lines in the bathroom
Ice sculpture melting in the ballroom
Go to hell
You don't, you don't, you don't deserve me

I'll be in the corner, sipping on my soda
Waiting for the moment you arrive
I'm your little nightmare, devil in disguise, yeah
Better watch your back, alright

I'm bad, bad, baby, bad, don't get mad
I am not your princess, stay out of my business
Bad, bad, baby, bad, don't get mad
I am not your princess, stay out of my business
Cause I'm ice cold and I don't play nice, no
If you come for me I'll eat you alive
Bad, bad, baby, bad, don't get mad
I am not your princess, stay out of my business

Did ya miss me?
If you wanna spill secrets, I got plenty
Screwed me over one too many times
Baying for your blood, I'll make you mine

I'm bad, bad, baby, bad, don't get mad
I am not your princess, stay out of my business
Bad, bad, baby, bad, why so sad?
I am not your princess (stay out of my business)
Cause I'm ice cold and I don't play nice, no
If you come for me I'll eat you alive
Bad, bad, baby, bad, don't get mad
I am not your princess, stay out of my business
