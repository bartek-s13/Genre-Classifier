I can feel it on the back of my tongue
All of the words getting trapped in my lungs
Heavy like a stone, waiting for the river to run

I wanna lash out
I wanna let it out
'Cause I can feel it on the back of my tongue
On the back of my tongue
Oh, oh, oh

Oh, hard to hold this fire inside me
All I know is sometimes it's frightening
Hard to hold this fire inside me
Oh, oh-oh, it's not really like me to lash out (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I gotta let it out (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I wanna lash out (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I wanna lash out

I got something to say, might start a riot
Rip that tape from my mouth, I won't be quiet
'Cause everything is nothing
'Til you realize it's something you want

I wanna lash out
I wanna let it out
'Cause I can feel it on the back of my tongue
On the back of my tongue
Oh, oh, oh

Oh, hard to hold this fire inside me
All I know is sometimes it's frightening
Hard to hold this fire inside me
Oh, oh-oh, it's not really like me to lash out (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I gotta let it out (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I wanna lash out (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I gotta let it out

I can't be the cork, come out of the bottle (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I can't be the cork, come out of the bottle (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I can't be the cork, come out of the bottle (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I can't be the cork, come out of the bottle (Oh, oh, oh, oh)

Lash out
I wanna let it out
'Cause I can feel it on the back of my tongue
On the back of my tongue
Oh, oh, oh

Oh, hard to hold this fire inside me
All I know is sometimes it's frightening
Hard to hold this fire inside me
Oh, oh oh, it's not really like me to lash out (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I gotta let it out (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I wanna lash out (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I wanna let it out (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I gotta lash out
