Come close like before
Do you remember how it feels
To know what you're living for?
Let me tell you what it's like
To dream about you
Every day and night
And I'm looking for you
But you're not by my side
Baby, won't you remember?

I'll see you when the sun sets
'Cause I've got anecdotes from years ago
So you'll remember how hard I loved you, baby
We were like a dream but real to me
Don't you remember how hard I loved you, baby?
Give me some time to remind you what it's like
Won't you remember just how hard I loved you, baby?
I still love you, baby, I still love you, baby
Won't you remember just how hard I loved you, baby?

I'll wait out for you
Right by the place we used to go
My arms were made for two
So let me tell you what it's like
To dream about you
Every day and night
And I'm looking for you
But you're not by my side
Baby, won't you remember?
I'll see you when the sun sets
'Cause I've got anecdotes from years ago
So you'll remember how hard I loved you, baby
We were like a dream but real to me
Don't you remember how hard I loved you, baby?
Give me some time to remind you what it's like
Won't you remember just how hard I loved you, baby?
I still love you, baby, I still love you, baby
Won't you remember just how hard I loved you, baby?
