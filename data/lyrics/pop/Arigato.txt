I'm a big girl, baby
Now why you acting so shady lately?
You don't need to babysit me
Arigato, later dude
Gotta find another you, yeah someone new
I'm about to steal a car
On my way to a random bar
I'm a Columbus, 'cause he went too far
I'm a big girl baby
Don't protect me from the big world, baby

Oh, what you trying to protect me from?
I'm just 'tryna have some fun
But when we wake in the morning, stuck in a corner
Oh, just tell me why I have to stay
I don't really like to play it safe
Arigato motherfucker
So arigato, later

I'm a big shot baby
You can't handle my outbursts, you see
Gotta let me go crazy, baby
Arigato, what's the use
Everything you got to lose, is me and you
All I wanna do is run
Wanna see who I become?
I'm not a housewife, never will be one
I'm a big shot baby
I'm the one who makes the big bucks baby

Oh, what you trying to protect me from?
I'm just 'tryna have some fun
But when we wake in the morning, stuck in a corner
Oh, just tell me why I have to stay
I don't really like to play it safe
Arigato motherfucker
