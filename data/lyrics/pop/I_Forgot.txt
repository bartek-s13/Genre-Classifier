Heard your voice from the balcony
I started looking for the closest way out
To get by without meeting you
Heard my name, someone telling you
I'm standing right outside the door on your right
Got no time for a good excuse

Didn't know you would be here, looking like the best I've ever had
Didn't know that I would feel like every time you move like that
Walk into the room, and I can't refuse ya
Didn't know that we would meet up, feeling like four years never passed

For a minute, you thought you'd fooled me
For a minute, you got me lost
For a second, I thought you loved me
But just when the music stopped
Realized why I left you in a hurry
When I'm close to you, everything is blurry
For a second, I thought you loved me
For a second, I forgot
I forgot
I forgot

I think I might still remember your taste
But if I don't, could you please remind me?
'Cause I miss how I used to feel
Now, you and I, dancing face to face
And the other people fade to grey
If we stop, I'm afraid you'd leave

Didn't know you would be here, looking like the best I'd ever had
Didn't know that we would meet up, feeling like four years never passed

For a minute, you thought you fooled me
For a minute, you got me lost
For a second, I thought you loved me
But just when the music stopped
Realized why I left you in a hurry
When I'm close to you, everything is blurry
For a second, I thought you loved me
For a second, I forgot

I forgot
I forgot
I forgot
I forgot

Forgot why I left in the first place
Forgot why I left without notice
It was easier that way

I forgot (For a minute, for a second)
I forgot (You're thinking that you're something that you're not)
I forgot
I forgot
