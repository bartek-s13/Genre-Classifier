I don't need your money, I don't need a thing
Got you on my right side driving through LA
Cruising to the coast, I ain't been before
You go all the time, show me more
Now we got the sunset, now we got the view
You look at the water, I'm looking at you
Then you look at me, I know you're the one

I been on the run
And I don't even know what's coming
Thinking I was numb
And now you got me feeling something
And if I ever leave
I already know I'll regret it
You had me on the sunrise
Now you got me on a love ride

Now you got me on a love ride
Now you got me on a love ride
Now you got me on a love ride

Don't be worried, we'll take it slow
You're my only, you already know
Falling deeper as we go
It's no wonder you're not alone
Catch this feeling, and take me home
And take me home, yeah, yeah

I been on the run
And I don't even know what's coming
Thinking I was numb
And now you got me feeling something
And if I ever leave
I already know I'll regret it
You had me on the sunrise
Now you got me on a love ride

Now you got me on a love ride

So when this comes together you better believe
We'll make it through the weather and then you'll see
Just how much I need you and just how much you mean to me
Mean to me
'Cause

I been on the run
And I don't even know what's coming
Thinking I was numb
