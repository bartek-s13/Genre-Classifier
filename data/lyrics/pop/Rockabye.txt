Call it love and devotion
Call it a mom's adoration, foundation
A special bond of creation, hah
For all the single moms out there
Going through frustration
Clean Bandit, Sean-da-Paul, Anne-Marie
Sing, make them hear

She works at nights, by the water
She's gone astray, so far away
From her father's daughter
She just wants a life for her baby
All on her own, no one will come
She's got to save him (Daily struggle)

She tells him, "Oh, love, no one's ever gonna hurt you, love."
"I'm gonna give you all of my love."
"Nobody matters like you."
(Stay up there, stay up there!)
She tells him, "Your life ain't gon' be nothing like my life." (Straight!)
"You're gonna grow and have a good life."
"I'm gonna do what I've got to do."
(Stay up there, stay up there!)

So, rockabye, baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye, baby, don't you cry
Somebody's got you
Rockabye, baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye, baby, don't you cry
Ah, rockabye, no

Rockabye, rocka-rocka-rocka-bye
(Rockabye, yeah, yeah)
Rockabye, rocka-rocka-rocka-bye

Single mum, how're you doing out there?
Facing the hard life, without no fear (Yeah!)
Just so you know that you really care
'Cause any obstacle come, you're well prepared (Oh, no!)
And no, mama, you never shed tear
'Cause you have to shed things year after year (Na, na, na, na)
And you give the yout love beyond compare (Yeah!)
You find his school fee and the bus fare (Yeah!)
Mh, all when di pops disappear
Inna rum bar, can't find him nowhere
Steadily your workflow, heavily you know
So your non-stop, no time, no time for ya dear

Now she got a six-year-old
Trying to keep him warm
Trying to keep out the cold
When he looks in her eyes
He don't know he is safe

When she says, "Oh, love, no one's ever gonna hurt you, love."
"I'm gonna give you all of my love."
"Nobody matters like you."

So, rockabye, baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye, baby, don't you cry
Somebody's got you
Rockabye, baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye, baby, don't you cry
(Badda-bang-bang-bang, alright then)
Ah, rockabye, no

Rockabye, rocka-rocka-rocka-bye
(Rockabye, yeah, yeah)
Rockabye, rocka-rocka-rocka-bye
Rockabye, don't bother cry
Lift up your head, lift it up to the sky, yo
Rockabye, don't bother cry
Angels surround you, just dry your eye

Now she got a six-year-old
