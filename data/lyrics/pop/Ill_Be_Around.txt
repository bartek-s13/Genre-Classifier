<<<<<<< HEAD
Just like a sad song
On a rainy day
Just like a heartache
That won't go away
All I've ever known
Is feeling alone
Just like a treasure
That I cannot reach
I bring a cake but
I can't have a piece
Now something has changed
My life rearranged
Sleepless nights
I don't get no time off
Still I can't get enough
You fit my heart like a glove
Sleepy days
My head's no longer hurting
I'm not sure if it's working
I think about you too much
(oh too much)
You can always call me
If you ever need me
The sun might go down
But you know it's not leaving
I'll be around
I'll be around
You can always hold me
If you wanna feel me
Baby don't be scared
You gotta keep believing
I'll be around
I'll be around
I'll be around
I'll be around
Oh I'll be around
You can always hold me
If you wanna feel me
Baby don't be scared
You gotta keep believing
I'll be around
