Let's go!
Nightmare!
Rock!

Dressed head-to-toe
Black on black
Three bunnies in the back
Of my Cadillac
With me it's gonna be
A good story to tell
Cash, grass, and ass
On the highway to hell
Be careful what you wish for
When you dream

I make the good girls bad
And bad girls worse
Nice guys are last
Cause I'm always first
I'm a freak-show sucker
For how it feels
Turn the girl next door
Into hell on heels
I'm red, white, blue, tattooed, and just don't care
I'm your all-american nightmare

If you want to run away
I can give you a ride
I'm a one-way ticket
To your darker side
Come with me
Baby, let's lose some sleep
Don't mistake me for a dream

I make the good girls bad
And bad girls worse
Nice guys are last
Cause I'm always first
I'm a freak-show sucker
For how it feels
Turn the girl next door
Into hell on heels
I'm red, white, blue, tattooed, and just don't care
I'm your all-american nightmare

They try to lock me up
And throw away the key
But they're never gonna hold down
A freak like me
I'm an outcast, smoking grass, living for speed
And I'll be anything you want
But nothing less than that
Stick to me baby

I make the good girls bad
And bad girls worse
Nice guys are last
Cause I'm always first
I'm a freak-show sucker
For how it feels
Turn the girl next door
Into hell on heels
I'm red, white, blue, tattooed, and just don't care
I'm your all-american nightmare
I'm your all-american nightmare
I'm your all-american nightmare

Yeah
And I'll be nothing less than that
Yeah
