<<<<<<< HEAD
Back in the Ronald Reagan days
When we put satellites in space
When boys wore skinny leather ties, uh-woh-oh
Like Don Johnson from Miami Vice
When Eminem was just a snack
And Michael Jackson's skin was black
Back when the coolest thing in store
Was a Commodore 64

Back to the 80's, back to Soap
Back to Rocky and Cherry Coke, yeah
Those were the days
And we go back to the 80's
Say "Hey there, Mister T"
To Twisted Sisters on MTV, yeah
Those were the days
Ah, come back

To Iron Maiden and 7Up (Uh-wow-yeah)
Bananarama and Breakfast Club
Come back (Yeah)
Come back (Yeah)
Ah, come back
When Huey Lewis was the news
When we went flying with Tom Cruise
When shoulder pads and looking tough, uh-woh-oh
Was the dirty David Hasselhoff
Too many men with heavy makeup on (Hey)
Too many poodles with guitars
Thanks for all the joy you’ve given us
You will always be our superstars

Back to the 80's, back to Soap (Back to Soap)
Back to Rocky and Cherry Coke, yeah
Those were the days
And we go
