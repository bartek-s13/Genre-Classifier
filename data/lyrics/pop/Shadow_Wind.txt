In this city of time
With no time to win
We all got caught by the shadow wind
Shadow wind
Through the walls of blinds
Running past our skin
We all got caught by the shadow wind
Shadow wind

Frosting the cold heart
See where it goes
Casting the weak signs
Wrapping it's arms around you
The compound of silence
Catching the souls of neon
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Lost in the distance
Fighting this war
Your heart is a weapon
Catching the glow
The sirens keep calling out
Hunting around for stories
Oh-oh-oh-oh

In this city of time
With no time to win
We all got caught by the shadow wind
Shadow wind
Through the walls of blinds
Running past our skin
We all got caught by the shadow wind
Shadow wind

And we run, we're running out of the cold
And we run, we're running out of the cold
And we run, we're running out of the cold
And we run, we're running out of the cold
And we run, we're running out of the cold
And we run, we're running out of the cold

Face in the water
Bodies are cold
Hitting the bottom
Floating across the ocean
We dive in the waves of hope
Drown as the world is floating
Oh-oh-oh-oh

In this city of time
With no time to win
We all got caught by the shadow wind
Shadow wind
Through the walls of blinds
Running past our skin
We all got caught by the shadow wind
Shadow wind

And we run, we're running out of the cold
And we run, we're running out of the cold
And we run, we're running out of the cold
And we run, we're running out of the cold
And we run, we're running out of the cold
And we run, we're running out of the cold

In this city of time
With no time to win
We all got caught by the shadow wind
Shadow wind
Through the walls of blinds
Running past our skin
We all got caught by the shadow wind
Shadow wind

And we run, we're running out of the cold
And we run, we're running out of the cold
And we run, we're running out of the cold
