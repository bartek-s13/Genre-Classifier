I want a hippopotamus for Christmas
Only a hippopotamus will do
I don't want a dog, no dinky Tinker Toy
I want a hippopotamus to play with and enjoy
I want a hippopotamus for Christmas
I don't think Santa Claus will mind, do you?
He won't have to use a dirty chimney flue
Just bring him through the front door, that's the easy thing to do
I can see me now on Christmas morning
Creeping down the stairs
Oh what a joy and what surprise when I open up my eyes
To see a hippo hero standing there
I want a hippopotamus for Christmas
Only a hippopotamus will do
No crocodiles, no rhinoceroses
I only like hippopotamuses
And hippopotamuses like me too
Mom says the hippo would eat me up, but then
Teacher says a hippo is a vegetarian
I can see me now on Christmas morning
Creeping down the stairs
Oh what a joy and what surprise when I open up my eyes
To see a hippo hero standing there
I want a hippopotamus, I want a hippopotamus
I want it, I want it, I really really really want
A hippopotamus
I want a hippopotamus for Christmas
Only a hippopotamus will do
I don't want a dog, no dinky Tinker Toy
I want a hippopotamus to play with and enjoy
I want a hippopotamus for Christmas
Only a hippopotamus will do
No crocodiles, no rhinoceroses
I only like hippopotamuses
And hippopotamuses like me too
Christmas
