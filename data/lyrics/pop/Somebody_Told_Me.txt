Breaking my back just to know your name
Seventeen tracks and I've had it with this game
I'm breaking my back just to know your name
But Heaven ain't close in a place like this
Anything goes but don't blink, you might miss
'Cause heaven ain't close in a place like this
I said, oh, heaven ain't close in a place like this
Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight
Never thought I'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight

Well, somebody told me you had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend
That I had in February of last year
It's not confidential, I've got potential

Ready? Let's roll onto something new
Taking its toll then I'm leaving without you
'Cause heaven ain't close in a place like this
I said, oh, heaven ain't close in a place like this
Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight
Never thought I'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight

Well, somebody told me you had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend
That I had in February of last year
It's not confidential, I've got potential
A-rushing, rushing around
Pace yourself for me
I said maybe, baby, please
But I just don't know now (Maybe, baby)
When all I want to do is try

Well, somebody told me you had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend
That I had in February of last year
It's not confidential, I've got potential
A-rushing, rushing around
Somebody told me you had a boyfriend
