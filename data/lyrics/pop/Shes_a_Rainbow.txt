Dearest, I'm broken, my body's unspoken
How could I be loved?
Wake up in the morning
Feeling uncertain like a burning old scar

For I remember the courage I had as a child
Various colors I'm hiding inside

She's a rainbow, ah...
She's a rainbow, ah...
And I am a difficult man
And I am a difficult man

Baby, I'm choking, my rhythm is smoking
I'm floating around
Shaking in the frozen Earth that I've chosen
Surfing the clouds

For I remember the joy I have had as child
Various colors I'm hiding inside
She's a rainbow, ah...
She's a rainbow, ah...
And I am a difficult man
And I am a difficult man
Oh, and I am a difficult man


She's a rainbow, ah...
She's a rainbow, ah...
Oh-oh, oh-oh...
Oh-oh, oh-oh...
Oh-oh, oh-oh...
