Stay, I never meant
What I said to you
Please wait, and let me confess

I know I know
I know I know it takes a lot to understand me
My mind don't mind
My mind don't mind it's harder than setting me free

You could make a change but you still don't anyway
How you're gonna give what you take?
You could not get down but I'll pick you up again
Let me be your fix when you break
You could make a change but you still don't anyway
How you're gonna give what you take?
You could not get down but I'll pick you up again
Let me be your fix when you break

Truth, it hurts
But I need to address
All the ways I've messed up
With you, I'm a must
I swear to the surface
So pull back the curtains, I
I know I know
I know I know it takes a lot to understand me (Oh, babe)
My mind don't mind
My mind don't mind it's harder than setting me free

You could make a change but you still don't anyway
How you're gonna give what you take?
You could not get down but I'll pick you up again
Let me be your fix when you break
You could make a change but you still don't anyway
How you're gonna give what you take?
You could not get down but I'll pick you up again
Let me be your fix when you break


You could make a change but you still don't anyway
How you're gonna give what you take?
