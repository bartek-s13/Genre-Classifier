We're all bad bonez
We can see it when we're all alone
It's all in good faith
We all have it but you'll have to wait
But to be honest
I'm quite fine living life so complacent
And to be candid
Sometimes I hate the fact that I'll face it
Bad Bonez
We're just so scared
I don't mean to act like I don't care
But once you have known
You'll be able to live with Bad Bonez
But to be truthful
It's so hard thinking that II'm not special
And to be open
You can't blame anyone for hoping
Bad bonez
