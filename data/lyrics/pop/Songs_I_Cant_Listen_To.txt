There's a song that I love
That you once played for me
It had all the right chords
And a sweet melody
It was back when we started
When there was mystery
Now they've all been erased
On my music machine

And it's all because of you
I've got a list of songs I can't listen to
And it's all because we're through
I've got a list of songs I can't listen to

And do you still sing alone
When you're all by yourself?
Or do you switch to the next one
Sing for somebody else?
And when you're cold, don't forget
How this song kept us warm
You would dance on my bed
I would lay in your arms
And it's all because of you
I've got a list of songs I can't listen to
And it's all because we're through
I've got a list of songs I can't listen to
And it's all because of you
I've got a list of songs I can't listen to
And it's all because we're through
I've got a list of songs I can't listen to

And I wish the music didn't play forever
'Cause I'm feeling like a broken record
And I wish the music didn't play forever
'Cause I'm feeling like a broken record

And it's all because of you
I've got a list of songs I can't listen to
And it's all because we're through
I've got a list of songs I can't listen to
And it's all because of you
I've got a list of songs I can't listen to
And it's all because we're through
I've got a list of songs I can't listen to
