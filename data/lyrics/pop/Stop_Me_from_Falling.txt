Somehow, we've always been together
But never got together
I never felt the pressure 'til now
There's something in the air
I'm here and you're just there
I can't pretend that I don't care

Yeah, one day I might get it right
Am I ready for tonight?
Yeah, caution, caution, amber lights
Still can't get you off my mind

Don't know how, I don't know where
But we're becoming more than friends
Getting closer to the edge
Stop me from falling
Shoulda seen the warning sign
Now I'm running out of time
Kinda wanna cross the line
But stop me from falling

For you, for you
Stop me from falling
For you, for you
Stop me from falling

One risk from lying on your shoulder
When I was feeling colder
And now I can't get over
One kiss, a dangerous situation
I'm lost in hesitation
My heart's a little shaken

Yeah, one day, I might get it right
Am I ready for tonight?
Yeah, caution, caution, amber lights
Still can't get you off my mind

Don't know how, I don't know where
But we're becoming more than friends
Getting closer to the edge
Stop me from falling
Shoulda seen the warning sign
Now I'm running out of time
Kinda wanna cross the line
But stop me from falling

For you, for you
Stop me from falling
For you, for you
Stop me from falling

Don't know how, I don't know where
But we're becoming more than friends
Getting closer to the edge
Stop me from falling
Shoulda seen the warning sign
Now I'm running out of time
Kinda wanna cross the line
But stop me from falling

For you, for you
Stop me from falling
For you, for you
Stop me from falling
