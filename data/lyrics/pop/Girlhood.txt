Nobody moves, it's a movie
How do I look now? Am I a beauty?
Whatever makes me a modern girl
Well, nothing makes me a modern girl

Fantasy rules and it's there in my room
Yeah, I tear myself apart for kicks, for you
Whatever makes me a modern girl
Nothing makes me a modern girl

Hands shaking, breaking mirrors, it keeps me up all night
Give me heroism, give me what is mine
Yeah, that's me you've seen there dancing in denial
And all the boys say
"You alright? You've been in there a while"

Two lines in the pink and I'm back in the clinic
Whatever makes me happy, well, I push it away, yeah
Whatever makes me a modern girl
Well, nothing makes me a modern girl

In my dreams I'm more than vixen or divine
Give me heroism, give me what is mine
Yeah, that's me you've seen there dancing in denial
And all the boys say
"You alright? You've been in there a while"


And I hold my hand out for you, face to face, you lie
C'mon, give me heroism, give me what is mine
Yeah, that's me you've seen there dancing in denial
And all the boys say
"You alright? You've been in there a while"

"You've been in there a while
You've been in there a while
