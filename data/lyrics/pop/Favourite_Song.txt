I have seen your face
A million times before
It's painted in my mind
It's painted on the walls
I'm driving on the road
I'm driving to a party
The ones you never go to
They play my favourite song all night

We dance in the morning
We don't sleep when the cars swing by
We dance in the morning
You look in, you look into my eyes
You look into my eyes
You look into my eyes
You look into my eyes

And when I think about this life with you
It makes me go do do do, do do do
When I think about this life with you
It makes me go do do do, do do do do
When I think I'm going to leave the room
It makes me go do do do, do do do do
When I think about this life with you
It makes me go do do do, do do do do

I used to know your face
But now it's not so clear
It's taken from my mind
It's taken from my walls
And now I'm driving home
I'm driving from the parties
The ones you never went to
They play my favourite song all night

We dance in the morning
We know that the morning turns to night
We danced in the morning
You used to, you looked into my eyes
You looked into my eyes
You looked into my eyes
You looked into my eyes
You looked into my eyes

And when I think about this life with you
It makes me go do do do, do do do
When I think about this life with you
It makes me go do do do, do do do do
When I think I'm going to leave the room
It makes me go do do do, do do do do
When I think about this life with you
It makes me go do do do, do do do do
