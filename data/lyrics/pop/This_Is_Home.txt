Often I am upset that I cannot fall in love but I guess
This avoids the stress of falling out of it
Are you tired of me yet?
I'm a little sick right now but I swear
When I'm ready I will fly us out of here
(Ooh) I'll cut my hair
(Ooh) To make you stare
(Ooh) I'll hide my chest
And I'll figure out a way to get us out of here

Turn off your porcelain face
I can't really think right now and this place
Has too many colors, enough to drive all of us insane
Are you dead?
Sometimes I think I'm dead
'Cause I can feel ghosts and ghouls wrapping my head
But I don't wanna fall asleep just yet
(Ooh) My eyes went dark
(Ooh) I don't know where
(Ooh) My pupils are
But I'll figure out a way to get us out of here
Get a load of this monster
He doesn't know how to communicate
His mind is in a different place
Will everybody please give him a little bit of space?
Get a load of this train wreck
His hair's a mess and he doesn't know who he is yet
But little do we know, the stars
Welcome him with open arms
Oh
(Ooh) Time is
(Ooh) Slowly
(Ooh) Tracing his face
But strangely he feels at home in this place
