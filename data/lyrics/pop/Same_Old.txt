<<<<<<< HEAD
The same old drive-in, nights hanging in the car
Same old burning room without you
The same old pillowtalk, smoking in my yard
Watch the same old stars from my roof

I know that it looked easy for me to let you go
Doing all the things we planned without you
I get how it looks like I kept the best of us
And left the memories with you

I know I'm not allowed to say I’m hurting
'Cause I hurt you and I know that
I know I'm not allowed to say I miss you
’Cause I left you, so I hold back
Know I'm not allowed to feel the feelings I've felt
So I keep it to myself
But I'm still wondering how you're doing
'Cause I'm the same old me without you
Same old with someone new

The same old birthdays, drunken nights with our friends
'Til 4 AM like nothing’s really changed
And now I’m kissing him like I kissed you then
Same old crazy love, but not the same

And I get how it looks like I kept the best of us
And left the memories with you

I know I'm not allowed to say I’m hurting
'Cause I hurt you and I know that
I know I'm not allowed to say I miss you
'Cause I left you, so I hold back
Know I’m not allowed to feel the feelings I've felt
So I keep it to myself
But I'm still wondering how you're doing
'Cause I'm the same old me without you
Same old with someone new

Same old with someone new
The same old drive-in, burning room
Same old love with someone new
Same old with someone new

I know I'm not allowed to say I'm hurting
'Cause I hurt you and I know that
I know I'm not allowed to say I miss you
