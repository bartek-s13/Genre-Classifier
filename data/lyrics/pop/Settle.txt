Oh, I felt a release
And I feel, yellow becoming me

Oh oh, standing on this wire
Makes me realise I am alive
And I won't settle

Move on, and up
Now that, I've found
My way back from you

I keep parts belonging to me
And I steal the better ones I need

Oh oh, standing on this wire
Makes me realise I am alive
And I won't settle

Move on, and up
Now that, I've found
My way back from you
Ooh

Move on, and up
My mind is clear
Remembering all the things I've done
Done
All the things I've done
