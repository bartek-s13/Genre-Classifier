Picking up the phone too late
Thought I'd be at home by eight
Wish I could recall all the things I've told you

Think I'll let it pass away
So in love with yesterday
Think I'll let it pass away
So in love with yesterday

Guess it's all the same to me
Always tend to think of she
In the midst of all it was great to know you

Think I'll let it pass away
So in love with yesterday
Think I'll let it pass away
So in love with yesterday
