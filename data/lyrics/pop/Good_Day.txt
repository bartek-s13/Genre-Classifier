Today is gonna be a good day
Don't care what anybody else say
Oh-oh-oh, I don't need a fortune cookie to tell me the way I'm feelin'
Gonna be a good day
A good day

Woke up, just woke up
My girlfriend warned me that I drink too much
Advil, the good pill
Head pounds like the bass on a party bus
Memories, no memories
The Instagram's tellin' me everythin'
And I regret nothin', oh

Ooh-ooh-ooh, I feel like a million bucks in the toilet
Ooh-ooh-ooh, my head to my toes to my soul has been poisoned
Livin' proof, that even when your whole life has been destroyed, shhh...
You still can enjoy it

Today is gonna be a good day
Don't care what anybody else say
Oh-oh-oh, I don't need a fortune cookie to tell me the way I'm feelin'
Gonna be a good day
A good day
A good day (it's gonna be a what?)
A good day

Last night, 'bout last night
Got in a fight with the karaoke mic
Shots fired, by Fireball
Can't tell what's the ceilin' or what's the wall

Ooh-ooh-ooh, I feel like a million bucks in the toilet
Ooh-ooh-ooh, my head to my toes to my soul has been poisoned
Livin' proof, that even when your whole life has been destroyed, shhh...
You still can enjoy it

Today is gonna be a good day
Don't care what anybody else say
Oh-oh-oh, I don't need a fortune cookie to tell me the way I'm feelin'
Gonna be a good day
A good day

Keep it goin' up, I'll keep it goin', I'll keep it goin', ah-woo
Keep it goin', I'll keep it goin', I'll keep it goin', ah-woo
When the mornin' comes, when the mornin' comes, still we're goin', ah-woo
Keep it goin', I'll keep it goin', I'll keep it goin', ah-woo
Aww yeah, okay, I'm goin' to sit down for a sec
I need a bloody mary

Today is gonna be a good day
Don't care what anybody else say (Aww...ouch)
Today is gonna be a good day (that's right)
Don't care what anybody else say (don't care, don't care what anybody says)
Oh-oh-oh, I don't need a fortune cookie to tell me the way I'm feelin'
Gonna be a good day
A good day
Gonna be a good day (keep it goin', ah-woo)
Don't care what anybody else say (keep it goin', ah-woo)
Oh-oh-oh, I don't need a fortune cookie to tell me the way I'm feelin'
Gonna be a good day (keep it goin', ah-woo)
A good day
