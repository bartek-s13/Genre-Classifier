Stop! Take it slowly, darling
This time I'm feeling a change
Stop thinking too much about it
Love's gonna heal us again and again
Sway! Just move with me, darling
And I'm going to move with you too
Can't stop, now you got me started
On top, such a beautiful view

Stop! Take it slowly, darling
This time I'm feeling a change
Stop thinking too much about it
Love's gonna heal us again and again
Again and again
Again and again
Again and again
Again and again
Again and again
Again and again
Again and again
Again and again
Again and again
Again and again
Again and again
Again and again
Again and again
Again and again
Again and again
Sway! Just move with me, darling
Sway! Just move with me, darling
Sway! Just move with me, darling
Sway! Just move with me, darling
Just move with me, darling
Just move with me, darling
