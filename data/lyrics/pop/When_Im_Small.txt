Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Lucy's underground
She's got a mouth to feed
Am I underground
Or am I in between?
Lucy's underground
She's got a mouth to feed
Am I underground
Or am I in too deep?

Show me love
You've got your hand on the button now
Sure enough
You've got your hand on the button now

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Lucy's underground
She's never coming back
Am I still alive
Or has the light gone black
Take me underground
Take me all the way
Bring me to the fire
Throw me in the flames

Show me love
You've got your hand on the button now
Sure enough
You've got your hand on the button now

I'd rather die
I'd rather die
(in counterpoint)
Than to be with you
Than to be with you
I'd rather die
I'd rather die
I'd rather die
I'd rather die
(in counterpoint)

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
