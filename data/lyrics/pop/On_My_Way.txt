I ain't no millionaire, but I'm on my way
Can't find love, but hell, I'm on the way
When the world gets heavy, you might hear me say
I'm on my way, on my way, way
On my way, on way, way

There's a little devil in us all
Swear everybody in this town just wants to see you fall
Baby, it's no fun, so know it's just a game, yeah
Oh, keep running outta love
And I don't go giving up
When I'm running outta love, love
No, let's say I've had enough
And I don't go giving up
I said it all before

I ain't no millionaire, but I'm on my way
Can't find love, but hell, I'm on the way
When the world gets heavy, you might hear me say
I'm on my way, on my way, way
I ain't no millionaire, but I'm on my way
Can't find love, but hell, I'm on the way
When the world gets heavy, you might hear me say
I'm on my way, on my way, way
I ain't no millionaire, but I'm on my way
Can't find love, but hell, I'm on the way
When the world gets heavy, you might hear me say
I'm on my way, on my way, way
On my way, on way, way
I ain't no millionaire, but I'm on my way
Can't find love, but hell, I'm on the way
When the world gets heavy, you might hear me say
I'm on my way, on my way, way
I ain't no millionaire, but I'm on my way
Can't find love, but hell, I'm on the way
When the world gets heavy, you might hear me say
I'm on my way, on my way, way
