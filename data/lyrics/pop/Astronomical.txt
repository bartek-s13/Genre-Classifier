The endless of darkness is hovering
The sound of the silence is deafening
Ten billion decibels shattering

Forces of gravity taking me, taking me
Weightlessness forsaking me

Ooh this pull is astronomical
Ooh this pull is astronomical

I'm drawn to the unknown, where shadows hide
A slave to the powers that magnetize
There's something inside of me, I can't fight

Forces of gravity taking me, taking me
Weightlessness forsaking me

Ooh this pull is astronomical
Ooh this pull is astronomical
Can anybody, anybody
Anybody, anybody
Anybody, anybody
Anybody, stop me?
Can anybody, anybody
Anybody, anybody
Anybody. Can anybody stop me?
Anybody stop me

Ohh this pull is astronomical
Ohh this pull...
