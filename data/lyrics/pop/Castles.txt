You learn my love, you hit the target
You get that rush and then you walk out the door
You kept me small, it's what you wanted
I never noticed
You held my hand into the darkness
I didn't care, it made me just want you more
My god, your love, it seems so harmless
I never noticed

And I hate that you're gone
And I hate that I don't wanna let go
And I hate that you think that I'm weak
'Cause I don't wanna let you know

I'm gonna build castles
From the rubble of your love
From the rubble of your love
I'm gonna be more than
You ever thought I was
You ever thought I was (Ooh)

Each time you left, there was a hunger
I felt so dead, I couldn't take anymore
Losing your love, it left me stronger
I never noticed

And I hate that you're gone
And I hate that I don't wanna let go
And I hate that you think that I'm weak
'Cause I don't wanna let you know

That I'm gonna build castles
From the rubble of your love
From the rubble of your love
I'm gonna be more than
You ever thought I was
You ever thought I was

Oh, oh
Oh, oh

That I'm gonna build castles
From the rubble of your love
From the rubble of your love
I'm gonna be more than
You ever thought I was
You ever thought I was, oh
Castles
From the rubble of your love
From the rubble of your love
I'm gonna be more than
You ever thought I was
You ever thought I was
That I'm gonna build castles
From the rubble of your love
From the rubble of your love
I'm gonna be more than
You ever thought I was
You ever thought I was

That I'm gonna build castles
From the rubble of your love
From the rubble of your love
I'm gonna be stronger
Than you ever thought I was
