I was so young, I was so dumb when I gave you my heart
Think you池e so mean, think you池e so clean in your old classic car
But honestly looks can be deceiving you look good from afar
But when you池e up close you池e a loser and you lowered the bar

Oooo, finally got back everything I gave to you
Every part of me that I left in your room
Now I really don稚 care what you do, or who you do it with
I really don稚 care, I think I just quit

I was bad now I知 better
I was sad now I知 better
Looking back I knew you were no good (no good)
I知 by myself and that痴 better
For my health you know know you put me through hell
But whatever, I知 good (I'm good)

I知 good, I知 good
I知 good, I知 good

You fooled me once and you fooled me twice, don稚 try me again
You池e comin around, tryna wear me down but I won稚 be your friend
And I dont wanna say it out loud but I still miss you now and then
I値l cover my tracks and I値l never go back cause you池e a dead-end
