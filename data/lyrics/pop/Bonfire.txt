<<<<<<< HEAD
Words, I can hear the whispers about me
Around me
Hurt, it hurts if I let all the poison in
If I let them win

Run your mouth, make it rain
You're trying to put my fire out
You feel better now?
Spill your hate, bring your wisdom
Throw it right into my flames
I want you to know

I am the bonfire
You make me stronger
You make me light up
With the shade you throw on me
Throw on me
I am the bonfire
You make me stronger
I'm going higher
I live off your gasoline, gasoline
I am the bonfire
I live off your gasoline, gasoline
Breathe, now I close my eyes
And I just breathe, I just breathe
Hurt, but shit that doesn't kill you
Makes you strong, so bring it on

Run your mouth, make it rain
You're trying to put my fire out
You feel better now?
Spill your hate, bring your wisdom
Throw it right into my flames
I want you to know

I am the bonfire
You make me stronger
You make me light up
With the shade you throw on me
Throw on me
I am the bonfire
You make me stronger
I'm going higher
I live off your gasoline, gasoline
Run your mouth around my business
So I don't look like them other bitches
Lifting drinks, yeah, that's my fitness
Fuel to the fire, fuel to the fire
Run your mouth, you can run your mouth
Think your rain put my fire out
Spilling hate, you feel better now?
Fuel to the fire, fuel to the fire

I am the bonfire
You make me stronger
You make me light up
With the shade you throw on me
Throw on me
I am the bonfire
You make me stronger
I'm going higher
I live off your gasoline, gasoline
I am the bonfire, I am, I am
I am the bonfire, what up, what up
I am the bonfire
You make me stronger
I'm going higher
