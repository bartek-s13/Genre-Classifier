That's my sweater, my sweater
Why the fuck you got it on?
We're not together, together
Shoulda left that shit at home

Uh, see the girl in the corner of the club? (Yeah)
That's my ex, we were once in love (Uh)
Haven't spoken in about six months (True)
'Til she - two of my friends at once
And that's when things got outta control (Ayy)
Took my shit, she said, "Baby, don't go" (Baby, don't go)
I don't wanna be here no more, shit (No more)

That's my sweater, my sweater
Why the fuck you got it on? Yeah, uh
(Why the fuck you got it on?)
We're not together (Together), together
Shoulda left that shit at home
(Okay, okay, okay, it goes like this)

It happened like one (One), two (Two), three or four times (Yeah)
Thought it was forever, but forever's not right (Not right)
I've been staying busy, I've been doing alright (Yeah)
But I'm only asking for my favorite fabric back
What more can I do? (Yeah)
When I look at you, fuck, I get confused
And I'm tryna, tryna just move on for a minute, like, damn

That's my sweater, my sweater
(That's mine, yeah)
Why the fuck you got it on?
(Why the fuck you got it on?)
We're not together, together
Shoulda left that shit at home
