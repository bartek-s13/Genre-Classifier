Tell me your secrets, I won't repeat them
This tug in my chest makes it hard to get rest
And I think that I’m better off dead
Tell me you mean it, give me your pieces
This hole in my heart makes it hard to restart
And I think that I'm falling apart

God only knows why
It comes and it goes
And gets lost on me
I'm scared that it shows
And I, I’m scared to believe

'Cause I love you, but sometimes, I'd rather die
Than have to feel this way inside

Tell me it's over, at least I'm closer
This weight on my neck makes it hard to connect
And I'm staring at my feet again
I don't think they know it, how bad I'm broken
The colors you see have become lost on me
And I can’t find the root of the bleed
God only knows why
It comes and it goes
And gets lost on me
I’m scared that it shows
And I, I'm scared to believe

’Cause I love you, but sometimes, I'd rather die
Than have to feel this way inside

God only knows why
It comes and it goes
And gets lost on me
I'm scared that it shows
And I, I'm scared to believe

’Cause I love you, but sometimes, I'd rather die
