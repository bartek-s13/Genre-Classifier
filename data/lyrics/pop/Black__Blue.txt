"This isn't gonna work"
You said, with make up running down your face
I can see you're hurt
But a bit of hope is all I'm trying to trace

I hate to see you cry, with the tears I've made
But what's gone wrong since yesterday?

I won't let us go down, down, down
For this love I won't lose
Soon answers will be found, found, found
And our hearts no longer black and blue
Our hearts no longer black and blue
Our hearts no longer bruised

"I won't do this anymore"
You said, whilst packing up your clothes
I'll block your path to the door
And tell you the reasons why you shouldn't go

Let's wait out the storm, take one deep breath
'Cause giving up leads to regret
I won't let us go down, down, down
For this love I won't lose
Soon answers will be found, found, found
And our hearts no longer black and blue
Our hearts no longer black and blue
Our hearts no longer bruised
Oh no no, oh no no, oh no no

I won't let us go down, down, down
For this love I won't lose
Soon answers will be found, found, found
And our hearts no longer black and blue
Our hearts no longer black and blue
Our hearts no longer bruised
