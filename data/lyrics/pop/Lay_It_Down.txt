And I don't mind
'Cause I speak my mind sometimes
And I think it's time for me to try
To lay the blame where blame lies

I've been searching
For whoever made me feel this way
I'm not liking where it's leading
Or who it's leading to

'Cause it's you
'Cause it's you
'Cause it's you
'Cause it's you

Oh, so I said I'd speak the truth
But I didn't think it'd be to you
I guess I'm sorry I had to lay it down
But no one gets to push me around

I've been searching
For whoever made me feel this way
I'm not liking where it's leading
Or who it's leading to
'Cause it's you
'Cause it's you
'Cause it's you
'Cause it's you


'Cause it's you
'Cause it's you
'Cause it's you
'Cause it's you
'Cause it's you
'Cause it's you
'Cause it's you
