And you're always a treat when you're here with me
Like a record on repeat
Something makes you flee
And I don't know where I've got you
Lately, where have you been?
You're like a drop of perfume
That never leaves my skin
Calling out your name like you're my vaccine
And I don't know what's real and what's fantasy

But you take me deep under the surface
Everytime I bring it up
We're trapped in a movie scene that never seems to stop

Are we just an illusion, are we?
Don't wake me up
Are we just an illusion, are we?
Don't wake me up

You're unreachable when you're in your zone
Making me feel like a complete unknown
And I don't know where I've got you
Lately, where have you been?
You're like a drop of perfume
That never leaves my skin
You're calling me up when you're drunk alone
And you know that I'm weak, I'll pick up the phone

But you take me deep under the surface
Everytime I bring it up
We're trapped in a movie scene that never seems to stop

Are we just an illusion, are we?
Don't wake me up
Are we just an illusion, are we?
Don't wake me up

So, are we just stuck in a dead end?
Don't wanna pretend
We can't just hide in here forever
In an illusion

Are we just an illusion, are we?
Don't wake me up
Are we just an illusion, are we?
Don't wake me up
