I'm done, you're overrated
Can't tell you when, can't tell you how
You've been so distant lately
The little things don't matter now
"I want that new Mercedes"
No other words come out your mouth
You've been so distant lately
You've been so distant lately

The fallout was enormous
You played me from four corners
You flanked me like a soldier
Drunk on the moment, but now I'm just hungover
And

I still wear that smile you gave to me
But it's out of fashion, it's fading

I'm done, you're overrated
Can't tell you when, can't tell you how
You've been so distant lately
The little things don't matter now
"I want that new Mercedes"
No other words come out your mouth
You've been so distant lately
You've been so distant lately
Lately, lately
You've been so distant lately
Lately, lately
You've been so distant lately

I'd come over and take a seat
But your clothes took over where it used to be
Now all of my favorite things I have a hard time remembering
Are your eyes blue or green?
I mean

I still wear that smile you gave to me
But it's out of fashion, it's fading

I'm done, you're overrated
Can't tell you when, can't tell you how
You've been so distant lately
The little things don't matter now
"I want that new Mercedes"
No other words come out your mouth
You've been so distant lately
You've been so distant lately
Lately, lately
You've been so distant lately
Lately, lately
You've been so distant lately

And I'll still pour a drink, on our anniversary
But not for us; for me. I'm finally remembering
I'll pour another drink, on our anniversary
But not for us; for me. I'm finally forgetting
It's done, we're over baby
I'll tell you when, I'll tell you how
You got so distant lately
The little things led us to now
Go get that new Mercedes
'Cause it ain't me you care about
Give me distance baby
You've been so distant lately
Lately, lately
You've been so distant lately
Lately, lately
You've been so distant
(scream) Don't matter now!

"I want that new Mercedes"
No other words come out your mouth
You've been so distant lately
You've been so distant lately
"I want that new Mercedes"
No other words come out your mouth
You've been so distant lately
You've been so distant lately
