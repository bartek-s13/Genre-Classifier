Why're we dancing solo, stuck here in a limbo
Sedated, isolated
Everyone's on coco, they buy it by the kilo
I know that you need to hear that I need you
Need to hear that I need you

See the spotlights on the shore
Decorated people in the search of something more
And the moon is a chandelier
Shining from a distance, showing all our fears

I don't know you, you don't know me
Como te llamas? Me IIamo
Smiles on you, dinner's on me
All I'm asking

Why're we dancing solo, stuck here in a limbo
Sedated, isolated
Everyone's on coco, they buy it by the kilo
I know that you need to hear that I need you
Need to hear that I need you

In a limbo, limbo
In a limbo, limbo

Like an endless masquerade
Following the rhythm of a paranoid parade
Where civilizations they collide
In jungle fornication OD-ing on the night

I don't know you, you don't know me
Como te llamas? Me IIamo
Eyes on you, dinner's on me
All I'm asking

Why're we dancing solo, stuck here in a limbo
Sedated, isolated
Everyone's on coco, they buy it by the kilo
I know that you need to hear that I need you
Need to hear that I need you
Why're we dancing solo, stuck here in a limbo
Sedated, isolated
Everyone's on coco, they buy it by the kilo
I know that you need to hear that I need you
Need to hear that I need you

In a limbo, limbo
In a limbo
