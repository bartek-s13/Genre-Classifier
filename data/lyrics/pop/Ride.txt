<<<<<<< HEAD
I'ma go and spend my money today
I've been working day and night and I'm in need of a break
I've been feeling so great
I got a pretty little shorty tryna ride on the wave, woah
I'ma go and spend my money today
I've been working day and night and I'm in need of a break
I've been feeling so great, yeah

So let's take a ride
You can never really get on my mind
At least when I'm drunk and holding out the life
When I'm drunk and holding out the life
And I've been so lost in time
Let's take another drink and fuck all night
Until we get lost in the lights
Until we get lost in the lights, ya
(I've been lost in time, oh
Let me take a ride, let me take a ride)

Yeah, I'ma catch a ride with the cool
Mixing dirty with the spice is just the way that we move
Drink up out our feelings, so loose
Let me take you on a trip
We're mixing Henney with juice
I ain't seen my home in a month
These people playing like the usual and not in a rush
They're thinking that I'm giving a fuck
But now a days I'm choosing carefully who I'm trust

So let's take a ride
You can never really get on my mind
At least when I'm drunk and holding out the life
When I'm drunk and holding out the life
And I've been so lost in time
Let's take another drink and fuck all night
Until we get lost in the lights
Until we get lost in the lights, ya

So tell me, do you fuckin' remember?
I've been lost and tired, I can't hold it together
Wine stain spilling on the snow and the coke
I know the winter gon' be cold
You gotta wait till November
We're gon' meet to fuck it and stay
Let it be farewell and moving away
I've been out here stealing my pay
I've been out here killing my pain, woah

So let's take a ride
You can never really get on my mind
At least when I'm drunk and holding out the life
When I'm drunk and holding out the life
And I've been so lost in time
Let's take another drink and fuck all night
Until we get lost in the lights
