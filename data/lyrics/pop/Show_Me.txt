Show me you love me as it all falls down

I could tell the Monday we met felt just like a weekend
Held me through my stupid problems
Didn't know the feeling was you partly playing pretend
But I loved it anyway, a year goes by and we're here today

We've been moving backwards
Waiting through the bad hurt
Existing in the upside down
We're just tiny little fractures
Dust upon a master
Ain't it time to turn around?

Show me you love me as it all falls down
We can pick up the pieces if I make it out
With you, with you
Show me you love me, don't just make the sounds

See the words are falling off your lips just like they're water
Hard to tell whats in between
Are you really here with me?
'Cause what this is, and what this does
It takes me and my time
So if it's fake, then take this as goodbye
Show me you love me as it all falls down
We can pick up the pieces if I make it out
With you, with you
Show me you love me, don't just make the sounds

We've been moving backwards
Waiting through the bad hurt
Existing in the upside down
We're just tiny little fractures
Dust upon a master
Ain't it time to turn around

Show me you love me as it all falls down
We can pick up the pieces if I make it out
With you, with you
With you, with you
