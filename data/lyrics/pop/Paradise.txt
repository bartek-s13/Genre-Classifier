I could lay me down forever in the smokey afternoon
'Cause, babe, these questions march forever
And I can see no answers coming soon
For they stop still and so have we now
Our hungry words left hanging in the air
Give up this needs forget the hours now
'Cause where we're heading, time no longer cares

Forgetting gets easy where the milk and honey run
(Paradise, paradise)
And our sense grows sharp off the fruits of an island sun
(Paradise, paradise)
So just lay back and wait for it to come
(Paradise, paradise)
'Cause paradise is somewhere where you and I belong
(Paradise, paradise)

The sky's are blazed with colors bursting, the tears collect and tumble down our cheeks
With such perfection, we're taken by the throat and has us on our knees

Forgetting gets easy where the milk and honey run
(Paradise, paradise)
And our sense grows sharp off the fruits of an island sun
(Paradise, paradise)
So just lay back and wait for it to come
(Paradise, paradise)
'Cause paradise is somewhere where you and I belong
(Paradise, paradise)
I've tasted the world, all its flavors
I've tried some lash-snatched moonlight savor
I've had sweet success and sweet failure
But I'm telling you, I'm telling you nothing quite tastes like…
(Paradise, paradise)

Forgetting gets easy where the milk and honey run
(Paradise, paradise)
And our sense grows sharp off the fruits of an island sun
(Paradise, paradise)
So just lay back and wait for it to come
(Paradise, paradise)
'Cause paradise is somewhere where you and I belong
(Paradise, paradise)

'Cause paradise is somewhere where
Paradise is somewhere where
