De-de-de-depression
Teenage suicidal
Why girls?
Emotional
Social anxiety

Pretty face with pretty bad dreams
No one knows I cry in my sleep
Waking up feeling like shit
It’s a normal thing to feel like this

I don’t care
I’m feeling down
I wanna stay home
Never go outside
Summer depression comes every year
I just want to disappear (depression)

Summer depression
There’s so much time to question my life
Summer depression
It’s my
Summer depression
My worst habit
Is my own sadness
So I stay up all night
Wondering why I'm so tired all the time

All my friends are doing things
It’s good for them
But I’m nothing
Summer depression comes every year
I just want to disappear (depression)

Summer depression (why?)
There’s so much time to question my life
Summer depression
It’s my
Summer depression
