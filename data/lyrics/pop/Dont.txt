Everybody and their mother
Say we ain't good for each other
But we ain’t good for anyone else
Now I know that we're through
But you're everything that I knew and
I can’t live without you 'cause I can't live with myself

You're the reason I quit drinking
The reason I get drunk
Everybody's thinking I should give you up

But I don't
You want me to forget you but I won't
And now you left me sitting, skipping stones
I should probably hate you but I don't
Don’t, don’t

I know that we're over
But tonight I hope you’re sober
'Cause you always go dancing when you drink
And it doesn't feel right if I'm not that guy
To be the one to sweep you off your feet
You’re the reason I quit smoking
The reason I get high
Everybody's thinking I should say goodbye

But I don't
You want me to forget you but I won't
And now you left me sitting, skipping stones
I should probably hate you but I don't
Don't, don't

Don't, don't
Don't, don't
(I should probably hate you)
Don't, don't
Don't, don't

But I don't
You want me to forget you but I won't
And now you left me sitting growing old
I should probably hate you but I don't
Don't, don't
But I don't
You want me to forget you but I won't
Now you left me sitting, skipping stones
I should probably hate you but I don't
Don't, don't
