I've been asking myself who I'm trying to be
I've been listening too much now you listen to me
Now you listen to me
Ey Yo, Vidorra is here
Ey Yo do you know what Vidorra means?
I'mma show you what Vidorra means!
I just wanna shake it like Elvis and sing it like Prince
Dance it like Michael so pour me a drink
I only got one life
I'll make it my own
I don't care 'bout Rock 'N' Roll
I just want that Bass you know
I don't care 'bout Rock 'N' Roll
I just want that Bass you know
See me banging my chest like i can't be tamed
Hear the lion roar, I'mma put him to shame
I'mma put him to shame
Ey Yo, Vidorra is here
Ey Yo do you know what Vidorra means?
I'mma show you what Vidorra means!
I just wanna shake it like Elvis and sing it like Prince
Dance it like Michael so pour me a drink
I only got one life
I'll make it my own
I don't care 'bout Rock 'N' Roll
I just want that Bass you know
I don't care 'bout Rock 'N' Roll
I just want that Bass you know
I don't care 'bout Rock 'N' Roll
I just want that Bass you know
I just wanna shake it like Elvis and sing it like Prince
Dance it like Michael so pour me a drink
I only got one life
I'll make it my own
I don't care 'bout Rock 'N' Roll
I just want that Bass you know
I don't care 'bout Rock 'N' Roll
I just want that Bass you know
