I guess I never showed you what you
Mean to me
When you're standing by my side I feel so free
Is this the first time or does everybody know?
Even if we're never more, promise you
Will never go
I can see you don't believe what I say
But I can tell you now I see it everyday
I was thinking maybe I could lay beside you
Each and every morning
I was hoping maybe I could hold your hand
Be the first thing that you see
As you wake up
I remember when I first thought that we could be
You smiled a little more when you looked at me
I could travel for miles and miles up in your eyes
And I won't stop with the dying of the light
I can see you don't believe what I say
But I can tell you now I see it everyday
I was thinking maybe I could lay beside you (lay beside you)
Each and every morning
I was hoping maybe I could hold your hand (hold your hand)
Be the first thing that you see
As you wake up
I was thinking maybe I could lay beside you
Each and every morning
I was hoping maybe I could hold your hand
Be the first thing that you see
As you wake up
I was thinking maybe I could lay beside you (lay beside you)
Each and every morning (every morning now)
I was hoping maybe I could hold your hand (hold your hand)
Be the first thing that you see
