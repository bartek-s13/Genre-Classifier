We go like oil and water, babe
We can’t start fires in pouring rain, yeah

No I can’t understand why I need you
Like I come back to life when I breathe you

I admit it
That I can’t be without you I’m twisted
I don’t know how I got so dependent
And I don’t even mind, mind, mind
I admit it
Every time that we touch I get lifted
When you’re near I get high in an instant
And I don’t even mind, mind, mind

We spark like wires across the dark
Tangled like fibers, electric heart

No I can’t understand why I need you
Like I come back to life when I breathe you
I admit it
That I can’t be without you I’m twisted
I don’t know how I got so dependent
And I don’t even mind, mind, mind
I admit it
Every time that we touch I get lifted
When you’re near I get high in an instant
And I don’t even mind, mind, mind

I don’t even mind
You can take my time, I don’t even mind
I don’t even mind
