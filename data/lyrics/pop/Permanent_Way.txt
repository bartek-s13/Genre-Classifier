One light fades
Let another shine in its place
It's just the moving of colours
My hands don’t play the same
But they'll try anyway
Each accusing the other
You can do what you want
But I'm making my own way in
Either you will or you won’t
You'll only know, if you count yourself in

If daylight breaks
And you're still miles away
You should move into cover
I'll try stay in a more permanent way
Can we keep to each other?
Where you been all this time?

Would you give one more day if you're able, I've wondered
Before they clear one more place at the table, I've wondered
A penny for your thoughts
So many fall before they reach the shore
If daylight breaks
And you're still miles away
You should move into cover
I’ll try stay in a more permanent way
Can we keep to each other?

You can do what you want
But I’m making my own way in
