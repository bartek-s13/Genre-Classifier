Ah, ah, ah
Tell me, is it really true?
This feeling that I feel for you
Your own kind of loving
That makes me think nothing
Could ever take the place of you
And it's so funny, funny what you do honey, honey
What you do, what you mean to me
And you know honey, honey, though it's so funny, funny
That you mean all the world to me
Ah, ah, ah
Ever since you came my way
I knew it was my lucky day
The sun started shining
When you started smiling
And I know it's gonna stay that way
And it's so funny, funny what you do honey, honey
What you do, what you mean to me
And you know honey, honey though it's so funny, funny
That you mean all the world to me
Can't imagine loving anyone but you
(Honey, honey, so funny, funny)
Every minute, loving everything you do
(Honey, honey, so funny, funny)
Couldn't see my way without you
Now I've gotta tell the world about you
Tell me, is it really true?
This feeling that I feel for you
Your own kind of loving
That makes me think nothing
Could ever take the place of you
And it's so funny, funny what you do honey, honey
What you do, what you mean to me
And you know honey, honey though it's so funny, funny
That you mean all the world to me
And it's so funny, funny what you do honey, honey
What you do, what you mean to me
And you know honey, honey 'though it's so funny, funny
That you mean all the world to me
