Arose from the ashes, the remains of a time set aside
The warrior of Eden, found by honor as two words collide

On and on and on, with glory he came, he saw, he conquered

He gathered his armies, true elite squads, the Templars of Steel
They sought out the dragon, made the enemy bleed, made them kneel

On and on and on, a legend unbent, unbowed, unbroken
On and on and on, a story is born, a legacy reborn!

Hammer high
To the sky
Follow the warrior and the king
Call out Hector's Hymn
Hammer high (Hammer high)
Amplify
Hail to the warrior!
Call out Hector's Hymn

Along came the thunder, and the hero was set to return
With hearts fueled by fire, our spirits were now set to burn

On and on and on, the fire and the flame will burn forever

Still guarded by Templars, all the secrets of steel will remain
Cause we are the keepers, and for us this is real, not a game

On and on and on, we follow his lead, we came, we conquered
On and on and on, together we fight, together we will fall

Hammer high
To the sky
Follow the warrior and the king
Call out Hector's Hymn
Hammer high (Hammer high)
Amplify
Hail to the warrior!
Call out Hector's
Call out Hector's Hymn
