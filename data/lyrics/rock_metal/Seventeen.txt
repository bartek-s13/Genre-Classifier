Yeah, I saw sparks fly from the corner of my eye
And when I turned it was love at first sight
I said, "Please excuse me, I didn't catch your name
It'd be a shame not to see you again"
And just when I thought
She was comin' to my door
She whispered sweet
And brought me to the floor
She said, "I'm only seventeen (Seventeen)
I'll show you love like you've never seen", oh
She's only seventeen (Seventeen)
Daddy says she's too young
But she's old enough for me
Mm, come to my place, we can talk it over
Oh, everythin' goin' down in your head
She said take it easy, I need some time
Time to work it out, to make you mine
And just when I thought
She was coming to my door
She whispered sweet
And brought me to the floor
She said,"I'm only seventeen (seventeen)
You ain't seen love
Ain't seen nothin' like me"
She's only seventeen, seventeen, yeah
Yeah, such a bad girl, loves to work me over time
Feels good dancin' close to the borderline
She's a magic mountain, she's a leather glove
Oh, she's my soul, it must be love
She's only seventeen (Seventeen)
The girl she gives me love
Like I've never seen
She's only seventeen (Seventeen)
Daddy says she's too young
But she's old enough for me (Seventeen)
She's everything I need (Seventeen)
Daddy says, she's too young
But she's old enough
Old enough for me, yeah yeah yeah
