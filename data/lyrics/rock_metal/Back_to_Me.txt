No turning back now
I'm moving ahead towards the way out
And don't you hate how
We get left behind in the fallout

Take a breath and take heart instead of pulling apart
When you find yourself back at the start

Every part of me
Catches on fire underneath
And when I ignite, you'll see
Maybe I can light the way, I can light the way back to me
Back to me

I won't stand down
As I feel the ground begin to crack now
So I cry out
The same call to arms but with a new sound

Take a breath and take heart when you are falling apart
And you don't even know where to start
Every part of me
Catches on fire underneath
And when I ignite you'll see
Maybe I can light the way, I can light the way back to me

Let hope be everything that you need
To march to a victory
When you can't feel the difference between
An inch and infinity

Every part of me
Catches on fire underneath
And when I ignite, you'll see
Maybe I can light the way, I can light the way
Every part of me
Catches on fire underneath
And when I ignite, you'll see
Maybe I can light the way, I can light the way back to me
Back to me
