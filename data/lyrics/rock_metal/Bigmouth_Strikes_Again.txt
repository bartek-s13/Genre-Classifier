Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking, when I said
I'd like to smash every tooth in your head
Oh... sweetness, sweetness, I was only joking when I said
By rights you should be bludgeoned in your bed

And now I know how Joan of Arc felt
Now I know how Joan of Arc felt
As the flames rose to her Roman nose
And her Walkman started to melt (oh)

Bigmouth la-da-da-dada, Bigmouth la-da-da-daa
Bigmouth strikes again!
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race (oh oh)
Bigmouth la-da-da-dada, Bigmouth la-da-da-daa
Bigmouth strikes again!
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race

And now I know how Joan of Arc felt
Now I know how Joan of Arc felt
As the flames rose to her roman nose
And her hearing aid started to melt
Bigmouth la-da-da-dada, Bigmouth la-da-da-daa
Bigmouth strikes again!
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race (oh oh)
Bigmouth la-da-da-dada, Bigmouth la-da-da-daa
Bigmouth strikes again!
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race (oh oh)
Bigmouth la-da-da-dada, Bigmouth la-da-da-daa
Bigmouth strikes again!
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race (oh oh)
Bigmouth la-da-da-dada, Bigmouth la-da-da-daa
Bigmouth strikes again!
And I've got no right to take my place
