Go!

Freedom is pain of another day
As I hear a hollow voice I am running away
Like a death grip voice on my scattered brain
I keep falling from grace, gone with no trace

Long for the days of boredom
Long for the days of hope
Take no blame for my past mistakes
I am living with hate, fucking with fate

This is the time (The time) we kill (We kill)
And fight to find a savior
The soul (The soul) we say (We say)
We're reckless and in danger
Ooh, ooh
What's lost is found
This is my vow!
Go!

Speak the shame of eternal rage
I am faking the truth
I'm going insane
Like a bomb that ticks when my heart clicks
I've been left for dead with what I’ve said

Long for the time that passes
Long for my innocence
Say my name as you play the game
If I go another day I'll be just the same!

This is the time (The time) we kill (We kill)
And fight to find a savior
The soul (The soul) we save (We save)
We're reckless and in danger
Ooh, ooh
What's lost is found
This is my vow!


This is the time (The time) we kill (We kill)
And fight to find a savior
The soul (The soul) we say (We say)
We're reckless and in danger
Ooh, ooh
What's lost is found
This is my vow
