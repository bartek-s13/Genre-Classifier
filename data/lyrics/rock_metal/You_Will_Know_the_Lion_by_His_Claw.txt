<<<<<<< HEAD
Purring the sweet tempered soughing
Of lucrative Savannah wind
Stirs the great flotsam of clouds that are vowing
To usher the evening in
Affecting the set of the reckoning sun
From burnished gold to crimson hue
Before this night is quite sorely undone
The Devil is coming for you
Like a ghost haunting the darkness
Stalking the veldt
Where many kings were felled
A savage growling rakes this grassy vastness
Halting you in the tracks you've laid
To rule this fulsome world
Now silent as a wisp of smoke
Terror grips you by the throat
You will know the lion by his claw
Mistaking fake demeanor
Was your first and fatal flaw
Never will the hunter
Ever be the hunted
Here or evermore
Taking my arena
Brought this courted slaughter to your door
I am nature's great restorer
First order Carnivora
Fate and foe, no time to implore
Mercy for she has fled
Tail tucked between her legs
Circled prey, recant and beg
To me alone this powder keg
Of teeth and jaws together
In a riot of adventure
I am Leonine and the ten commandments
Cut deep for your death
Damnation ad bestias
Through limitless whispering seas
Of redolent tropical plains
Whereupon mystery's blistery frieze
A slivering gibbous moon reigns
Aggressive, obsessive to snuff out your lights
I come a cold virulent grue
Blighting your guides and delighting inside
On the pride that is tiding for you
As a beast feasting it's hunger
Under this spell
Rifles and fire shall not repel
Industrious machinations rent asunder
Not miring me in traps well-laid
I'll not pale to unveil my Hell
You will know the lion by his claw
This violence is a plague of flame
Licking the brush to flush out game
A bellow of rage caged in yellow eyes
Sees evil life seized, unleashed reprisal
You will know the lion by his claw
Mistaking fake demeanor
Was your first and fatal flaw
Never will the hunter
Ever be the hunted
Here or evermore
Taking my arena
Brought this courted slaughter to your door
You will know the lion by his claw
Now hear the growing thunder roar
Damnation ad bestias
The walls of brackish thorn have fallen
Batterfang and chaos
Quick to marshal, maul the fools
Who stand by shattered loss
Your shadow scatters westward
Toward the fleeing stars
As a new dawn fees upon the skies
Heraldic, rampant,  battle-scarred
