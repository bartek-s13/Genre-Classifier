Dogs they roam
Remember where their home is
Everyone they meet
Chase away their enemies
Hang out in the shade
Always in the shade
When it's time to mate they're
Not too particular
Dogs they rule the night
They rule the night
Dogs they rule the night
Finish every meal
Settle for a snack
Chasing cars
Like to hang out in the park
Dogs they rule the night
They rule the night
Dogs they rule the night
Dogs they rule the night
They rule the night
Dogs they rule the night, yeah
In the pack they're very brave
They're very brave
And then after dark
Underneath the moon
Know what i mean?
Ever watch 'em go?
Into town when the sun goes down
Dogs they rule the night
They rule the night
Dogs they rule the night!
Yeah, the dogs they rule the night
They rule the night
Dogs they rule the night, yeah
Yeah!
