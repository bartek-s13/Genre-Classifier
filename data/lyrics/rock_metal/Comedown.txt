Love and hate
Get it wrong
She cut me right back down to size
Sleep the day
Let it fade
Who was there to take your place?
No one knows
Never will
Mostly me
But mostly you
What do you say?
Do you do?
When it all comes down?
Cause I don't want to come back down
From this cloud
It's taken me all this time
To find out what I need again
I don't want to come back down
From this cloud
It's taken me all this
All this time
There is no blame
Only shame
When you beg
You just complain
The more I come
The more I try
All police are paranoid
So am I
So's the future
So are you
Be a creature
What do you say?
Do you do?
When it all comes down?
Cause I don't want to come back down
From this cloud
It's taken me all this time
To find out what I need
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't want to come back down
From this cloud
It's taken me all this
All this time
Shoot up
Shoot up
Shoot up
You're high
Love and hate
Get it wrong
She cut me right back down to size
Sleep the day
Let it fade
Who was there to take your place?
No one knows
Never will
Mostly me
But mostly you
What do you say?
Do you do?
When it all comes down?
Cause I don't want to come back down
From this cloud
It's taken me all this time
To find out what I need
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't want to come back down
From this cloud
It's taken me all this
All this time
Why did you?
Why did you?
Why did you?
Why did you?
Why did you?
Why did you?
Why did you?
Why did you?
Why did you?
Come down
I don't want to come back down
From this cloud
