I lose control because of you babe
I lose control when you look at me like this
There's something in your eyes that is saying tonight
I'm not a child anymore, life has opened the door
To a new exciting life

It's all written down in your lifelines
It's written down inside your heart

You and i just have a dream
To find our love a place
Where we can hide away
You and I, we're just made
To love each other now
Forever and a day




Time stands still
When days of innocence are falling for the night
I love you girl I always will
I swear i'm there for you until the day I'll die
