Ay-ay, ay, ay-ay-ay-ay
Ay-ay-ay-ay, ay
Ay-ay, ay, ay-ay-ay-ay
Ay-ay-ay-ay, ay

At the starting line, a never ending race
What I've got inside isn't commonplace
I've been dreaming 'bout hope for better days
Time for dreaming's done, time to face the sun

(Flying high above the world)
It's a new life, it's a new mind
And I will never fall

(The time is now)
I can't contain myself, I've never felt so alive
(The time is now)
I'm past the breaking point, I set my soul on fire
Ay-ay, ay, ay-ay-ay-ay
Ay-ay-ay-ay, ay
(The time is now)
Ay-ay, ay, ay-ay-ay-ay
Ay-ay-ay-ay, ay
(The time is now)

I cannot stop, see another way
Am I looking for another cheap escape?
I've been pushing forward, crushing everything
It's a push and pull, it's a give and take

(Flying high above)
And it's a new life, it's a new mind
And I will never fall

(The time is now)
I can't contain myself, I've never felt so alive
(The time is now)
I'm past the breaking point, I set my soul on fire
Ay-ay, ay, ay-ay-ay-ay
Ay-ay-ay-ay, ay
(The time is now)
Ay-ay, ay, ay-ay-ay-ay
Ay-ay-ay-ay, ay
(The time is now)

Now (Hey, hey)
Now (Hey, hey)
Now (Hey, hey)
Now (Hey, hey)

Ay-ay, ay, ay-ay-ay-ay
Ay-ay-ay-ay, ay
Ay-ay, ay, ay-ay-ay-ay
Ay-ay-ay-ay, ay

(The time is now)
I can't contain myself, I've never felt so alive
(The time is now)
I'm past the breaking point, I set my soul on fire
Ay-ay, ay, ay-ay-ay-ay
Ay-ay-ay-ay, ay
(The time is now)
Ay-ay, ay, ay-ay-ay-ay
Ay-ay-ay-ay, ay
(The time is now)
