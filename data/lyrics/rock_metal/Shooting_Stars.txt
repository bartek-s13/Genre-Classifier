My love is stronger than yours
It's stronger than yours
It’s stronger than yours
My love is stronger than your hate will ever be
And my faith is deeper than yours
It's deeper than yours
It's deeper than yours
My faith is deeper than your doubt will ever be

We move through the world like
Shooting stars across the sky
Splitting through the darkness
Putting a light into their eyes

My laughter is louder than yours
It’s louder than yours
It's louder than yours
My laughter is louder than your shouting will ever be
And my dancing is better than yours
It's better than yours
It's better than yours
My dancing is better than your marching will ever be
We move through the world like
Shooting stars across the sky
Splitting through the darkness
Putting a light into their eyes

We move through the world like
Shooting stars across the sky
Splitting through the darkness
Putting a light into their eyes
We move through the world like
Shooting stars across the sky
Splitting through the darkness
Putting a light into their eyes

My love is stronger than yours
It's stronger than yours
It's stronger than yours
My love is stronger than your hate will ever be
