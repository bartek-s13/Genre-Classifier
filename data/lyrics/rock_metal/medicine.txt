I was done talking, but I still couldn't sleep
I rolled up my medicine, to forget me
Tried not to disappoint you but I didn't achieve
'Cause I have a problem
And I need to get some

But I shouldn't waste my time
Having you around
What was up's gone down
You take your road and I'll take mine

I don't want to talk about it unlike you
Your victimhood's your character, it defines you
And then you rearrange it caress it into view
You invent your problems
And then you sell them

Help me, why can't this be love?
Tell me why can't this be enough?
When is high ever high enough?
It's all I ever hoped for

But I shouldn't waste my time
Having you around
What was up's gone down
You take your road and I'll take mine

So swallow your problems
We belong to a new dawn
So swallow your problems
We belong to a new dawn
(so swallow)
If she asks should I tell her?
(your problems)
If she asks should I let her know?
(we belong)
We'll never be together
(to a new dawn)
We'll never see each other grow

But I shouldn't waste my time
Having you around
What was up's gone down
You take your road and I'll take mine

I was done talking but I still couldn't sleep
