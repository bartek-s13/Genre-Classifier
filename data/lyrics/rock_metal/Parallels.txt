<<<<<<< HEAD
We are all comatose
We are overfed and under, undernourished, yearning for something more
Never starving yet never quite satisfied
Carnal but without useful flesh or mind
I am a walking contradiction that's found consistency
Consuming everything, all without producing sustenance
In the parallels we struggle, struggle to upkeep
There is a better way for us to be set free
From all it is we crave, there must be more to life than to simply stay alive
To simply stay alive
We are not the same as I hope to show
There is a better way if we just let go
We are not, we are not the same
We are not, we are not the same
Let go
In the tension between devouring want or simple need
It's clear the only lines between the ones we preserve
We are not the same as I hope to show
There is a better way if we just let go
We are not, we are not the same
We are not, we are not the same
Let go
We are not the same
And in the parallels we struggle to upkeep
There's a better way for us to be, for us to be set free
And in the parallels we struggle to upkeep
There's a better way for us to be, for us to be set free
We are not the same as I hope to show
There is a better way if we just let go
We are not, we are not the same
We are not, we are not the same
Let go
