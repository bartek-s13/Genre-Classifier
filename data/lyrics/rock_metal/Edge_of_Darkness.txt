Every day's a new day
Every way's a new way
On the edge of darkness
Finding out what it means to love
And to think we've found the time

All my brothers we stand
For the peace of the land
Is there meaning
I've got love in my heart
For an army apart
I am bleeding
All my brothers we stand
For the peace of the land
Is there meaning
I've got love in my heart
For an army apart
I am bleeding

Always searching for love
Always searching for light
What the world is made of
When I'm thinking it's right
And to think we've found the time
All my brothers we stand
For the peace of the land
Is there meaning
I've got love in my heart
For army apart
I'm bleeding
All my brothers we stand
For the peace of the land
Is there meaning
I've got love in my heart
For an army apart
I am bleeding

Yeah, yeah...

I've got love in my heart
For army apart
I am bleeding

All my brothers we stand
For the peace of the land
Is there meaning
I've got love in my heart
For army apart
I am bleeding
