Queen of the Light
She has the keys to under-Earth
Her only wish, a holy rebirth
All dressed in the darkness
But she’ll trade it all for a white dress
Been out of morality too long
She swears our love has been dying
But what do you expect from the king of the damned
Been out of mortality too long
Still singing the same old dead song
But if you need to go…
And she walked out on the night
She lived the darkest life
But all she wants to be is the Queen of the Light
All these words from this brimstone bride
Claim the grass is always burning on the underside
Been down on this gravity too long
Still singing the same old falling song
But if you need to go…
She walked out on the night
She lived the darkest life
But all she wants to be is the Queen…
Yeah, all she wants to be…
Is the Queen of the Light
Yeah, the Queen of the Light
But if you need to go…
She walked out on the night
She lived the darkest life
But all she wants to be is the Queen…
Yeah, all she wants to be…
Is the Queen of the Light
Yeah, the Queen of the Light
Yeah, the Queen of the Light
Oh the Queen of the Light
