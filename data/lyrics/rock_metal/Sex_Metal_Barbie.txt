Excuse me, can you tell me what you've heard about my life?
Maybe a dirty, little fairytale, a girl of the night
I heard that I grew up filthy, a trailer park queen
Drop out, pregnant, statistical teen
I know you've heard about the bloody knife
About my daddy's perfect virgin and my mother's wife
You know I heard, I don't belong in this game
Still you hold your hands in the air, screaming my name, let's go

Baby, go ahead
I’ll be your hatred and your pain
This is killing us all, I don’t care if I fall
We’re the dying, we are the damned

Baby, go ahead
I’ll be the villain you can blame
I'll be the belle of the brawl, be the lust in us all
I’m the diva of the damned
I heard I don’t belong in this scene
Sex Metal Barbie, homicidal queen

Excuse me, can you tell me the worst thing you've heard about me?
Maybe that I'm a little harlot, homicidal queen
You know I heard that I don't belong in this scene
Sex Metal Barbie, whore, attention fiend
You know I heard that I'm a hater's dream
Low class, white trash, I'm so obscene
You know I heard, that I should be ashamed
Still they hold their fists in the air screaming my name
Baby, go ahead
I’ll be your hatred and your pain
This is killing us all, I don’t care if I fall
We’re the dying, we are the damned

Baby, go ahead
I’ll be the villain you can blame
I'll be the belle of the brawl, be the lust in us all
I'm the diva of the damned
I heard I don’t belong in this scene
Sex Metal Barbie, homicidal queen

Sex! Sex!
Sex Metal Barbie, homicidal queen
Sex! Sex!
Sex Metal Barbie, homicidal queen

So go ahead
I’ll be your hatred and your pain
This is killing us all, I don’t care if I fall
We’re the dying, we are the damned
Baby, go ahead
I’ll be the villain you can blame
I'll be the belle of the brawl, be the lust in us all
I’m the diva of the damned

Sex Metal Barbie
I’m a Sex Metal Barbie
Se-Sex Metal Barbie, homicidal queen
(Sex! Sex!) Baby, go ahead
Sex Metal Barbie, homicidal queen
(Sex! Sex!) Baby, go ahead
Sex Metal Barbie, homicidal queen
(Sex! Sex!) Baby, go ahead
Sex Metal Barbie, homicidal queen
(Sex! Sex!) Baby, go ahead
Sex Metal Barbie, homicidal queen
I heard I don't belong in this scene
Sex Metal Barbie, homicidal queen
