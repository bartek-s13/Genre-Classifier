This is hell
This is everything I love
But it's harder
Than it’s ever been before
Let it flow
Like a melody of blood
Look alive
Kid, you're turning skin and bones
Oh, I'm just pleased to know
I’m perfect for the role
Now lookit, I've arrived
Now lookit, I've arrived

Am I out of my mind?
Am I out of my mind?
Am I out of my mind?
Am I out of my mind?
Am I out of my mind, mind, mind?
Am I out of my mind, mind, mind?
Am I out of my mind?
Am I out of my mind?

Feel the faith go and drain out from the tub
Swirling down until there's nothin' but a gulp
Grab a wire and rip it on out the bomb
Oh, baby, this damage is done
Hey, ground swell command
Are you ready for the band?
Now lookit, I've arrived
Now lookit, I've arrived

Am I out of my mind? (Out of my mind)
Am I out of my mind?
Am I out of my mind? (Out of my mind)
Am I out of my mind?
Am I out of my mind, mind, mind?
Am I out of my mind, mind, mind?
Am I out of my mind? (Out of my mind)
Am I out of my mind?

Am I out of my mind? (Yeah)
Am I out of my mind? (Out of my mind)
Am I out of my mind? (Yeah)
Am I out of my mind? (Out of my mind)
Am I out of my mind, mind, mind?
Am I out of my mind, mind, mind?
Am I out of my mind? (Out of my mind)
Am I out of my mind?
