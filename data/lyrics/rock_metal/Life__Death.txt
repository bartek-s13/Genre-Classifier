Life - not that much to say
We start, we struggle we go away but
Death - couldn't be more true
Now everything you're telling me
Is everything I want to say to you
Life - I know, it isn't fair but 
Believe it or not
We're here to stay and
Death - Is for us tomorrow
Bring your thoughts and bring your sorrow

So did you really want to look inside
I know you're not a victim
And whatever you say
Whatever you do
Wherever you are just trick him
And Life is a dangerous thing
You can suddenly die
You are under the wings of
Death - it's just a thing to remember
From the beginning of the year
To snowy Christmas in December
Life - Keeps us under the roof of God
Keeps under the claws of
Death - until the day you die
You will go on searching but you will never know why

So did you really want to look inside
I know you're not a victim
And whatever you say
Whatever you do
Wherever you are just trick him
It's just life
And if a man wanna take you home now
If a man wanna buy you whole
Just say no
Just say no
Just say no
Just say no
And if you hear him ask for mercy
And you feel that he plays a role
Just say no
Just say no
Just say no
Just say no
So did you really want to look inside
I know you're not a victim
And whatever you say, whatever you do
Wherever you are just trick him
