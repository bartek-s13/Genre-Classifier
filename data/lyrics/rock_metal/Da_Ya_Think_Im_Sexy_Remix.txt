Oh, nah, yeah, yeah, yeah

She sits alone, waiting for suggestions
He's so nervous, avoiding all the questions
His lips are dry, his heart is gently pounding
Don't you just know exactly what they're thinking?
His heart's beating like a drum (like a drum)
Is he gonna get this girl home?
Real soon, baby, we'll be all alone
Don't you just know exactly what they're thinking?

If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on, sugar, tell me so
If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
Come on, honey, tell me so (Alright!)

He's acting shy, looking for an answer
Come on, honey, let's spend the night together
Now hold on a minute before we go much further
Give me a dime so I can phone my mother
They catch a cab to his high-rise apartment
At last he can tell exactly what his heart meant

If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on, sugar, tell me so (tell me so)
If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
Come on, honey, tell me so

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh, ooh
I like this, I like this, I like this

Come on, baby, spend the night
I promised to behave myself
Ah yeah! Ah yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

His heart's beating like a drum (like a drum)
Is he gonna get this girl home? (is he)
We'll soon, baby, we'll be alone
Don't you just know exactly what they're thinking?

If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on, sugar, tell me so
If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
Come on, honey, tell me so (uh, tell me so)

If you really, really, really need me
Just let me know, just let me know
If you really need me
If you really, really, really need me
Just let me know, just let me know
Oh, yeah, yeah
