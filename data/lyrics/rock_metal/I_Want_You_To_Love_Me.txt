I want you to love me baby, love your baby slow
I want you to love me baby, love your baby slow
I want you to love me baby 'til I drop dead in front of your door
I want you to love me baby, 'til my lips turn cherry red

I want you to love me baby 'til I fall dead across your bed. Oh yeah

Love me baby, love me baby
