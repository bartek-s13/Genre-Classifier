Broadcasted from a room that's full of it
Pushing weight, white coats are selling shit
You get lost in it
You fall victim to the cause of it
You're the reason they make money from it
Campaign of fear from year to year
But i don't think we're seeing crystal clear
Filled with doubt as you cover your mouth
Stay inside, don't go out
Outbreak! subliminal criminals fuck this system
Pandemonium, a modern dose of phobia
Up in a house medications got a hold of ya
Face your fate, section 8
Out snake the pusher
The elite got you hooked in a chemical state
Cancer causing capital
The people turned to animals
The poison is the antidote
Lab coat killer, hundred dollar biller
Automatically ill, bank roll filler
