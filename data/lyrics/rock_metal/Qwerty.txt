 (Waylon Reavis)
One shot heard around the world
Gonna bring it to a head
We're gonna show the world that it was
Once said
Whatever the cost
We will never surrender
Leave abandoned no loss
When the
When the rich wage war
And the patriotic whores
Dig their own grave
For their own sake
Another casualty
Another travesty
 (J. Mann)
Another motherfucking German shepherd
Growling with his teeth snappin'
Bitch slappin' smack rappin'
Kick you when the bass drop BOOM! BOOM!
Alpha to Zulu
I'm here to say FUCK YOU!!
I had a bad day
With her angel's wings
 (Jeff Hatrix &amp; J. Mann )
I had a bad day
(With her angel's wings)
I had a bad day
(With her angel's wings)
I had a bad day
(With her angel's wings)
 (Jeff Hatrix)
Fall in line glorify
Patriotic parasite
Punishment don't fit the crime of
Being bred to lead to slaughter
