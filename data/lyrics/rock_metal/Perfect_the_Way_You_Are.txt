You have what they don't, your heart is true
So dry your tears and let it shine through
'Cause you're amazing, look at you smiling
And don't change anything, there's no denying

You're beautiful, you're beautiful
And don't ever listen to what they say about you
You're perfect just the way you are
You will never be anything like them
And the strength is in your heart, whoa
You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're perfect just the way you are

You're beautiful, you're beautiful

Don't put yourself down, don't let them win
They don't understand who you are
'Cause you're amazing, look at you smiling
And don't change anything, there's no denying

You're beautiful, you're beautiful
And don't ever listen to what they say about you
You're perfect just the way you are
You will never be anything like them
And the strength is in your heart, whoa
You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're perfect just the way you are

Break down your walls
You can be the person you wanna be
Break down your walls
Become who you are

You're beautiful, you're beautiful
And don't ever listen to what they say about you
You're perfect just the way you are
You will never be anything like them
And the strength is in your heart, whoa, your heart
You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're perfect just the way you are
