My momma drinks scotch whiskey and my daddy drinks Jim Beam
I was conceived just outside of New Orleans
Told my ma I loved her while heaven just a played
Daddy was the worst mistake my momma ever made

I'm a son of the bourbon, I'm a son of a bitch
I'm a dying breed of rock and roll, been passed up in a ditch
Well, I've been up against the law, I served some time in jail
I've been known for getting stoned and raised my share of hell

They went back to Alabama one cold October day
Soon as I was born my daddy up and ran away
We got by on gettin by, we lived from week to week
As long as I got two good hands I'll work to earn my keep

I'm a son of the bourbon, I'm a son of a bitch
I'm a dying breed of rock and roll, been passed up in a ditch
Well, I've been up against the law, I served some time in jail
I've been known for getting stoned and raised my share of hell

My momma drinks scotch whiskey and my daddy drinks Jim Beam
I was conceived just outside of New Orleans
When my life is over and my time has come to pass
Bury me upside down so the world can kiss my ass
I'm a son of the bourbon, I'm a son of a bitch
I'm a dying breed of rock and roll, been passed up in a ditch
Well, I've been up against the law, I served some time in jail
I've been known for getting stoned and raised my share of hell
