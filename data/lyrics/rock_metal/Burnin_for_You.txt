Home in the valley, home in the city
Home isn't pretty, ain't no home for me
Home in the darkness, home on the highway
Home isn't my way, home I'll never be

Burn out the day
Burn out the night
I can't see no reason to put up a fight
I'm livin' for givin' the devil his due

An' I'm burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin' for you
I'm burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin' for you!

Time is the essence, time is the season
Time ain't no reason, got no time to slow
Time everlasting, time to play B-sides
Time ain't on my side, time I'll never know

Burn out the day
Burn out the night
I'm not the one to tell you what's wrong and what's right
I've seen signs of what a prison their lives went through

And I'm burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin' for you
I'm burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin' for you!


Burn out the day
Burn out the night
I can't see no reason to put up a fight
I'm livin' for givin' the devil his due

An' I'm burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin' for you
I'm burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin' for you
I'm burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin' for you
I'm burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin' for you!
