Make the people hold each other's hands
And fill their hearts with truth
You made up your mind
So do as divined
Put on your armour, ragged after fights
Hold up your sword
You're leaving the line
Make yourself ready for the lords of the dark
They watch your way
So be cautious, quiet and hark
You hear them whispering in the crowns of the trees
You're whirling round, but your eyes don't agree
Will-o'-the-wisps misguiding your path
You can't throw a curse
Without taking their wrath
Watch out for the seas of hatred and sin
Or all us people forget what we've been
Our only hope's your victory
Kill that Satan who won't let us be
Our only hope's your victory
Kill that Satan who won't let us begin
You're the keeper of the seven keys
That lock up the seven seas
And the seer of visions said before he went blind
Hide them from Demons and rescue mankind
Or the world we're all in will soon be sold
To the throne of the evil, paid with Lucifer's gold
To the throne of the evil, paid with Lucifer's gold
You can feel cold sweat running down your neck
And the dwarves of falseness throw mud at your back
Guided by spells from the old seer's hand
You're suffering pain only steel can stand
Stay well on your way and follow the sign
Fulfill your own promise and do what's divined
The seven seas are far away
Placed in the valley of dust, heat and sway
The seven seas are far away
Placed in the valley of dust, heat and sway
You're the keeper of the seven keys
That lock up the seven seas
And the seer of visions said before he went blind
Hide them from Demons and rescue mankind
Or the world we're all in will soon be sold
To the throne of the evil, paid with Lucifer's gold
To the throne of the evil, paid with Lucifer's gold
Throw the first key into the sea of hate
Throw the second key into the sea of fear
Throw the third key into the sea of senselessness
And make the people hold each other's hands
The fourth key belonged into the sea of greed
And the fifth into the sea of ignorance
Disease, disease, disease, my friend
For this whole world's in Devil's hand
Disease, disease, disease, my friend
Throw the key or you may die
Disease, disease, disease, my friend
For this whole world's in Devil's hand
Disease, disease, disease, my friend
Throw the key or you may die
On a mound at the shore of the last sea
He's sitting, fixing your sight
With his high iron voice causing sickness
He's playing you on with delight
Man, who do you just think you are?
A silly bum with seven scars
Don't throw the key or you will see
Dimensions cruel as they can be
Don't let him suck off your power
Throw the key, throw the key
Throw the key
An earthquake, squirting fire, bursting ground
Satan's screaming and earth swallowing him away
You're the keeper of the seven keys
You've locked up the seven seas
And the seer of visions can now rest in peace
There ain't no more Demons and no more disease
And mankind live up, you're free again
Yes, the tyrant is dead
He is gone, overthrown
You have given our souls back to light
