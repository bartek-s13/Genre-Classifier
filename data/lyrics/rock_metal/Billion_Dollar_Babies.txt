Billion dollar baby
Rubber little lady, slicker than a weasel
Grimy as an alley, loves me like no other lover

Billion dollar baby
Rubber little monster, baby I adore you
Man or woman living couldn't love you like me baby

We go dancing nightly in the attic
While the moon is rising in the sky
If I'm too rough tell me
I'm so scared your little head
Will come off in my hands

Billion dollar baby
I got you in a dimestore
No other little girl could ever
Hold you any tighter, any tighter than me baby

Billion dollar baby
Reckless like a gambler, million dollar maybe
Fighting like a dog who's been infected by the rabies

We go dancing nightly in the attic
While the moon is rising in the sky
If I'm too rough tell me
I'm so scared your little head
Will come off in my hands

Million dollar babies
Billion dollar babies
Trillion dollar babies
Zillion dollar babies
