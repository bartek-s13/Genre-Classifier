I can't wait to close my eyes
Kiss your lips of rain
When the flowers bloom to wine
I will come alive
I never thought I could love anyone
The way I'm lovin' you
I took a chance on holdin' you
And I fell on through
Hell, I tried to move on
But your love keeps comin' strong
Now every day I die in my heart
In tears I'm hangin'on
I can't wait to close my eyes
Kiss your lips of rain
Feel your love again
When the flowers bloom to wine
I will come alive
If you are my flame
My flame, flame
I never thought I could dream with anyone
The way I dream with you
Dream with you
Take me through the worlds of status
Back through heaven and hell
I'm home
I can't wait to close my eyes
And kiss your lips of rain
Hold my love again
When the flowers bloom into wine
I will come alive
Hold me now and let me breathe
Save me from my soul
You know my worlds are made
Where angels roam
Time we're comin' home to stay
My world
I can't wait to close my eyes
Kiss your lips of rain
Feel your love again
When the flowers bloom to wine
You are my life
