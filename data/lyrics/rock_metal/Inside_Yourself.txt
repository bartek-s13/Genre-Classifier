Falling back into these complications...
Sifting through these ashes from my grave
...Trying to find my way
Staring into an endless situation...
Dragged into these dirty waters again
...These waters you must be in
I cannot believe in myself, when everyone's telling me I'm worthless
And if you think I like it
Well, I'm telling you this time's different...
I'm not broken
You better take a good look inside yourself
Twisting everything, so tight around me...
Like a serpent that wraps around my neck
...And showing me no respect
You won't break me. You won't fake me
You won't rub my nose in shit for one more minute
...I'm swearing to God on this
I cannot believe in myself, when everyone's telling me I'm worthless
And you can think I like it
Well, I'm telling you this time's different...
I'm not broken
You better take a good look inside yourself
Inside yourself
Inside yourself
Inside yourself
I cannot believe in myself, when everyone's telling me I'm worthless
And you can think I like it
Well, I'm telling you this time's different...
I'm not broken
You better take a good look inside yourself
I cannot believe in myself, I cannot believe in myself
When I was telling me, I'm worthless
Well, I'm telling you this time's different...
I'm not broken
You better take a good look inside yourself
Inside yourself
