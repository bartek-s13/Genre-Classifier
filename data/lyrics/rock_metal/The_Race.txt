<<<<<<< HEAD
I heard there was a place where we're all one race
Color, gender, age never could dictate
I saw there was a time when we valued all life
Nobody oppressed, everyone had rights
Suddenly
In an age where the distance between us is binary
All we see
Is an internal war, friendly fire in the sky and respect on the floor

Constricting like a heart attack
A mythomaniac on the loose in the streets
Blood boiling with the burning heat
Of caustic defeat, now there's no turning back

Ha, so we laugh, while the tides all turn
Maiting grey matter, voluntarily slaves
Always searching for the one real truth
So we can misconstrue it to sun our needs

Constricting like a heart attack
A mythomaniac on the loose in the streets
Blood boiling with the burning heat
Of caustic defeat, now there's no turning back
Ingesting, operant conditioning
Divine contamination, like lye on flesh, it stings
Trust your leaders, trust the system, reproduce, repeat
Never question authority, never suspect deceit

Always on the run, can't remember what we're running to
Or what we're running from, but we're picking up speed
All the books and broadcast? Jettison
Without their burden, true ethics are freed
Extract the labels that lobotomize
And you'll realize, we are all one
Fly or swim, fur or skin
We're alive! Abolitionists rise

Constricting like a heart attack
A mythomaniac on the loose in the streets
Blood boiling with the burning heat
