Sitting under a sycamore tree
You turn those beautiful eyes to me
And then whisper so delicately
And you say what will become of us, my dear
And I'll smile at you and clutch your hand real tight
'Cause you're changing my life
I say our future is ours to paint
And I don't have much but I've got a lot to gain
And I wanna share it all with you
And I feel your heart go ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
It goes ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
It goes ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
It goes ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
And darling, you know we've got youth on our side
Let's have no worries or troubles in our minds, tonight
Let's take these moments day by day
And what's in store for us, who can say
And I feel your heart go ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
It goes ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
It goes ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
It goes ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
And I swear I love you till the end of my days
And ooh I swear I love you till the end of my days
And I feel your heart go ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
It goes ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
It goes ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
It goes ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
It goes ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
It goes ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
It goes ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
It goes ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
