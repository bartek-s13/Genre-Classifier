The drugs begin to peak
A smile of joy arrives in me
But sedation changes to panic and nausea
And breath starts to shorten and heartbeats pound softer

You won't try to save me
You just want to hurt me, and leave me desperate

You taught my heart a sense I never knew I had
I can forget the times that I was
Lost and depressed from the awful truth, how do you do it?
You're my heroine

You won't leave me alone
Chisel my heart out of stone, I give in every time

You taught my heart a sense I never knew I had
I can forget the times that I was
Lost and depressed from the awful truth, how do you do it?
You're my heroine
I bet you laugh at the thought of me thinking for myself
I bet you believe that I'm better off with you than someone else

Your face arrives again
A hope I had becomes surreal
But under your cover's more torture than pleasure
And just past your lips there's more anger than laughter
Not now or forever will I ever change you
I know that to go on, I'll break you, my habit

You taught my heart a sense I never knew I had
I can forget the times that I was
Lost and depressed from the awful truth, how do you do it?
You're my heroine

I will save myself!
