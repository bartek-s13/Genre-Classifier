Take My Hand Before I Go
We値l Never Be Alone
Look At All The Lucky Days
And Places We Have Gone
Let Me Say A Single Word
A Million Other Ways
But All I Wanna See Is Now
A Smile Upon Your Face
Like I知 Dancing - Dancing With An Angel
Like I知 Dancing - Never Danced Before
Like I知 Dancing - Dancing With An Angel
Like I知 Dancing - A Dream I知 Dancing On
Gave My Heart Into Your Hands
We Are Evermore
How Can I Repay You Now
For All The Years And More
All I Know So Deep Inside
We Will Never Fade
So Let Me Take You By The Hand
And Lead You To The Dance
Like I知 Dancing - Dancing With An Angel
Like I知 Dancing - Never Danced Before
Like I知 Dancing - Dancing With An Angel
Like I知 Dancing - A Dream I知 Dancing On
Still I知 Dancing Through A Dream With An Angel
I Don稚 Wanna Lose A Part Of Your Heart
Still You Give Me All The Worlds I Believe In
And I Know That We Will Never Part
Like I知 Dancing - Dancing With An Angel
Like I知 Dancing - Never Danced Before
Like I知 Dancing - Dancing With An Angel
Like I知 Dancing - A Dream I知 Dancing On
