Victory, we fought hard and prevailed
Brutally, we were fighting
Stormy seas, rolling thunder, piercing hail
Battlefield, lit by lightning
Eagerly, we filled the waves with enemies
Hungrily, ravens cawing
Home shore calls, we return on bloody seas
Twilight falls, darkness crawling

So pour the beer for thirsty men
A drink that they have earned
And pour a beer for those who fell
For those who did not return

Raise your horns, raise them up to the sky
We will drink to glory tonight
Raise your horns for brave fallen friends
We will meet where the beer never ends

No regrets, we went out to war and strife
To protect, king and country
Victory, honour those who gave their life
Willingly, we will not grieve

So pour the beer for thirsty men
A drink that they have earned
And pour a beer for those who fell
For those who did not return

Raise your horns, raise them up to the sky
We will drink to glory tonight
Raise your horns for brave fallen friends
We will meet where the beer never ends

Raise your horns, raise them up to the sky
We will drink to glory tonight
Raise your horns, raise them up to the sky
We will drink tonight

Raise your horns, raise them up to the sky
We will drink to glory tonight
Raise your horns for brave fallen friends
We will meet in Valhalla again
