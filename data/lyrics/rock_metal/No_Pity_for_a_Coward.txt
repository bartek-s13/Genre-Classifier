<<<<<<< HEAD
Dry your eyes
Hide your face with your hands
One last breath
Hold it in
Fuck your past
The future
Is in your hands
Just sit back and relax
Put your fucking shades on
Put that gun to your head
You're a fucking disgrace
Can your God save you now?
Can your God save you now?
Can your God save you now?
Can your God save you now?
Can your God save you now?
Can your God save you now?
You coward
You coward
You coward
You coward
Drowning yourself
In your tears
No one has
Pity for you
Pity for you
Pity for you
Pity for you
Seconds from the end
What's it gonna be?
Pull the trigger bitch
Seconds from the end
What's it gonna be?
Pull the trigger bitch
Seconds from the end
What's it gonna be?
Pull the trigger bitch
Seconds from the end
What's it gonna be?
