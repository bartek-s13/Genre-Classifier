Foolish love is suicide
Bullets to the heart, I can't break ties
Wanna light it up, say goodbye
But I can't let go, oh it's not right
You pull me in, skin on skin
I try to run, you pull me back again
'Cause there's no end, the circle that we're in
I guess I'm yours to guide

Got me where you want me on this twisted ride
Bite me on the lips, a false paradise
I should walk away, keep running for my life
It's taking a hold this time

Baby, I'm still locked on you
Got a lust, got a touch that I can't seem to lose
Baby, I'm still locked on you
Got a curse, yeah it hurts but I can't seem to leave
You got me where you want me on this twisted ride
Bite me on the lips, a false paradise
Baby, I'm still locked on you
Got a curse and it hurts but I can never break through
Intoxicate me, exhilarate me
Can't help myself but I don't need saving
Now there's no end, the circle that we're in
Around and round we go

Got me where you want me on this twisted ride
Bite me on the lips, a false paradise
I should walk away, keep running for my life
It's taking a hold this time

Baby, I'm still locked on you
Got a lust, got a touch that I can't seem to lose
Baby, I'm still locked on you
Got a curse, yeah it hurts but I can't seem to leave
You got me where you want me on this twisted ride
Bite me on my lips, a false paradise
Baby, I'm still locked on you
Got a curse and it hurts but I can never break through

I can't break free
Good Lord, you got your hold on me
Oh, won't you let me go?
Let me go
Baby, I'm still locked on you
Got a lust, got a touch that I can't seem to lose
Baby, I'm still locked on you
Got a curse, yeah it hurts but I can't seem to leave
You got me where you want me on this twisted ride
Bite me on my lips, a false paradise
Baby, I'm still locked on you
