You are the only reason why
I still believe that I could fly away
Die today
And leave this world in better hands
You are the hope that we will find a way
Finally

You're the reason I'm here
You make everything clear

If I'm not with you I am missing
If I'm not with you I won't go to war all by myself
But you're here and I'm still breathing
But you're here
Now I know what it's like to miss things
Now I know how to fall in love when I can't love myself
But you're here so I'm still breathing
But you're here

Your only limit is the sky
Infinite shots to take, so fire away
Rely on me
I fire it up, you burn it down
I teach, you learn
We will survive today
Defiantly
You're the reason I'm here
You make everything clear

If I'm not with you I am missing
If I'm not with you I won't go to war all by myself
But you're here so I'm still breathing
But you're here
Now I know what it's like to miss things
Now I know how to fall in love when I can't love myself
But you're here and I'm still breathing
But you're here

It's always for you and you too, hmm
