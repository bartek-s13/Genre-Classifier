I really love you, baby
I love what you've got
Let's get together, we can
Get hot
No more tomorrow, baby
Time is today
Girl, I can make you feel
Okay

No place for hiding, baby
No place to run
You pull the trigger of my

Love gun, (Love gun) love gun
Love gun, (Love gun) love gun

You can't forget me, baby
Don't try to lie
You'll never leave me, mama
So don't try
I'll be a gambler, baby
Lay down the bet
We get together, mama
You'll sweat
No place for hiding, baby
No place to run
You pull the trigger of my

Love gun, (Love gun) love gun
Love gun, (Love gun) love gun

(Love gun)
(Love gun)

Love gun, (Love gun) love gun
Love gun, (Love gun) love gun

Love gun, (Love gun) love gun
Love gun, (Love gun) love gun

Love gun (Love gun)
Love gun (Love gun)
Love gun (Love gun)
