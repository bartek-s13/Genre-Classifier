In times of turmoil, in times like these
Beliefs contagious, spreading disease
This wretched mischief is now coursing through your souls
Never to let go, never to let go

Them rats! (Rats–rats–rats–)

Into your sanctum, you let them in
Now, all your loved ones and all your kin
Will suffer punishments beneath the wrath of God
Never to forgive, never to forgive

Them rats! (Rats–rats–rats–)
(Ah whoah)
Rats! (Rats–rats–rats–)
(Ah whoah)
Rats! (Rats–rats–rats–)
(Ah whoah)
Rats! (Rats–rats–rats–)
(Ah whoah)

This devastation left your cities to be burnt
Never to return, never to return

Them filthy rodents are still coming for your souls
Never to let go, never to let go

Them rats! (Rats–rats–rats–)
(Ah whoah)
Rats! (Rats–rats–rats–)
(Ah whoah)
Rats! (Rats–rats–rats–)
(Ah whoah)
Rats! (Rats–rats–rats–)
(Ah whoah)

(Rats!) They're still coming after you
(Ah whoah)
(Rats!) And there's nothing you can do
(Ah whoah)
(Rats!) They're still coming after you
(Ah whoah)
(Rats!) And there's nothing you can do
(Ah whoah)
Rats! (Rats–rats–rats–rats–rats–rats–)
