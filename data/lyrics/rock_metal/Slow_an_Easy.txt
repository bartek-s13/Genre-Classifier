You keep on pushing, babe
Like I've never known before
Know you want it crazy, child
I just wanna see you on the floor
I wanna superstitious woman
She got a superstitious mind
I can't see you, baby
I can't see you anymore, no more
You keep on loving me
Like I've never known before
I wanna superstitious woman with a superstitious
A superstitious mind, an' I don't mind, baby
Oh, lookout
My heart is beating faster, babe
It's beating like a big bass drum
You know you got me speeding, child
Faster than a bullet from a gun
You're a superstitious woman
And got a superstitious mind, one I don't care
So take me down slow an' easy
Make love to me slow an' easy
I know that hard luck an' trouble
Is coming my way
So rock me till I'm burned to the bone
Rock me till I'm burned to the bone
I don't care about
Oh, I don't care about love, no more
The way you keep abusin' me
I never wanna, I can't take no more
I want a woman
She got a superstitious mind
So take me down, slow an' easy
Make love to me, slow an' easy
I know that hard luck an' trouble
Is coming my way
So rock me till I'm burned to the bone
Rock me till I'm burned to the bone
Rock me till I'm burned
So take me down, slow an' easy
Make love to me, slow an' easy
Take me down, slow an' easy
Rock me till I'm burned to the bone
An' take me down, slow an' easy
Make love to me, slow an' easy
I know that hard luck an' trouble
Is coming my way
So rock me till I'm burned to the bone
So take me down, slow an' easy
Make love to me, slow an' easy
I know that hard luck an' trouble
Is coming my way
So rock me till I'm burned to the bone
Rock me till I'm burned to the bone
