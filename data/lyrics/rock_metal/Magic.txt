I took a ride down your street at night
Just to feel like we haven't changed
Never had the chance to change your mind
Now someone else had took my place
Hold the moment while it fades away
And I, I wanna make I wanna make it through the other side
And I, I wanna make I wanna make it through
Oohh
Another time, you pulled me down so hard
I paint your body with my own, colour seeps into my bones again
So where you gonna hide, anymore? Where you gonna hide?
I swear it's only right if we go, if we go again
And I, I wanna make I wanna make it through the other side
And I, I wanna make I wanna make it through the other side
Because I don't believe in magic, usually
But you changed my mind, you changed my heart and
I don't believe in magic, usually, usually (oooh)
Because I don't believe in magic, usually
But you changed my mind, you changed my heart and
I don't believe in magic, usually, usually
