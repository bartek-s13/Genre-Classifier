Freedom, la la la la
Freedom, follow me
Freedom, la la la la
Freedom, cut it
Freedom, la la la la
Freedom, follow me
Freedom, la la la la
Freedom

Let me tell ya, I'm vicious, not pass-aggressive
I got my finger on my pulse, starin' straight into a hole and I'ma get it
And I'm a savage, it's automatic
I got a way of makin' noise, the power to destroy with no static

'Cause victory is all you need
So cultivate and plant the seed
Hold your breath and count to ten, just count to ten

I'm gonna make it rain, so ring the bell
I know it all too well
Switchblade on the edge of your wrist
Can I get a witness? (Witness!)
'Cause agony brings no reward
For one more hit and one last score
Don't be a casualty

Cut the cord
Freedom, la la la la
Freedom, follow me
Cut the cord
Freedom, la la la la
Freedom

You gotta feel courage, embrace possession
If it was easier to shatter everything that ever mattered, but it's not, because it's your obsession
Be a fighter, backbone, desire
Complicated and it stings, but we both know what it means, and it's time to get real and inspired

'Cause victory is all you need
So cultivate and plant the seed
Hold your breath and count to ten, just count to ten
Just count to ten

I'm gonna make it rain, so ring the bell
I know it all too well
Switchblade on the edge of your wrist
Can I get a witness? (Witness!)
'Cause agony brings no reward
For one more hit and one last score
Don't be a casualty

Cut the cord
Cut it
Cut it


'Cause victory is all you need
So cultivate and plant the seed
Hold your breath and count to ten, just count to ten

I'm gonna make it rain, so ring the bell
I know it all too well
Switchblade on the edge of your wrist
Can I get a witness? (Witness!)
'Cause agony brings no reward
For one more hit and one last score
Don't be a casualty, cut the cord
Don't be a casualty, cut the cord

Freedom, la la la la
Freedom, follow me
Cut the cord
Freedom, la la la la
Freedom, follow me, me, me
