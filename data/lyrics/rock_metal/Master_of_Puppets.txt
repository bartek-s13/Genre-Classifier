End of passion play, crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
Leading on your death's construction

Taste me, you will see, more is all you need
Dedicated to how I'm killing you

Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your...

Master! Master!
Master of Puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master! Master!
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master! Master!
Needlework the way, never you betray
Life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly, ritual misery
Chop your breakfast on a mirror

Taste me, you will see, more is all you need
Dedicated to how I'm killing you

Come crawling faster (faster)
Obey your master (master)
Your life burns faster (faster)
Obey your...

Master! Master!
Master of Puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master! Master!
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master! Master!
(Master, master, master, master...)


Master! Master! Where’s the dreams that I’ve been after?
Master! Master! You promised only lies
Laughter! Laughter! All I hear or see is laughter
Laughter! Laughter! Laughing at my cries
Fix me!


Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Never-ending maze, drift on numbered days
Now, your life is out of season

I will occupy, I will help you die
I will run through you, now I rule you too

Come crawling faster (faster)
Obey your master (master)
Your life burns faster (faster)
Obey your...
Master! Master!
Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master! Master!
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master! Master!
