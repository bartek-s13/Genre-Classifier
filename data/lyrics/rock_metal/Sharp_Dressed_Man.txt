<<<<<<< HEAD
Clean shirt, new shoes
And I don't know where I am goin' to
Silk suit, black tie (black tie)
I don't need a reason why

They come runnin' just as fast as they can
Cause every girl's crazy 'bout a sharp dressed man

Gold watch, diamond ring
I ain't missin' not a single thing
And cufflinks, stick pin
When I step out I'm gonna do you in

They come runnin' just as fast as they can
Cause every girl's crazy 'bout a sharp dressed man


Top coat, top hat
I don't worry cause my wallet's fat
Black shades, white gloves
Lookin' sharp and lookin' for love
They come runnin' just as fast as they can
Cause every girl's crazy 'bout a sharp dressed man

You can't lose with the dress I use
