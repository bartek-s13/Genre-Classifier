Well, you told me that I was just not the one
And you left me standing out in the cold
It's been a long time, and I'm so much better now
That I'm looking back and seeing it all
And for the first time, there's no pain in my life
It's been a long, hard road that I've gone
We had a good thing, and it made me a man, and I know
You've got me going
Pardon me my feelings are showing
I'm only saying what's on my mind
Well, I found you, or maybe I found myself
And I think we knew it all the time
We fit together just like a lock and a key
And we open up each other's minds
Yeah, I was laughing, cause there was no room to cry;
There was too much growing to do
We had a good time, and it ain't over yet, cause I know
You've got me going
Will you pardon me my feelings are showing?
I'm only saying...
You came from nowhere, and you just jumped in my life
And I know it never will be the same
You made me love you, now I'm home once again;
No, I never want to leave you no more
Cause I returned to the better half of myself
And there is nowhere else that I'd rather be
You filled an empty; you fixed up my broken heart
Yes, I know you've got me going
Pardon me, my feelings are showing
I'm only saying what's on my mind
(I'm only saying)
What's on my mind
(I'm only saying)
What's on my mind
(I'm only saying)
What's on my mind
(I'm only saying)
