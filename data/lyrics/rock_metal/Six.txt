I wish I was free of this

I see her in my dreams
Wish that she wasn't there
(But she still haunts me and I)
Still feel her breath on me
Still want to taste her skin
(But I know that would kill me)
No!
Damn her; still, I choke on her lies
Still reeling from her last caress, her goodbye

Oh how this sickens me
This wretched fools' affair
(I can't erase this from me)
And now it permeates
And every thought I feel
The anger writhes in my soul

No!
Damn her, still I feel my stomach turn
Choke back, hold my head high, I'm strong!
No!
Damn her, still I choke on her lies
Not reeling, I'm strong



Damn her, still I feel my stomach turn
Choke back, hold my head high, I'm strong!
No!
Damn her, still I choke on her lies
Not reeling, I'm strong!

I wish I was free of this!
