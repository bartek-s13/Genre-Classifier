<<<<<<< HEAD
Same old song on the radio tonight
One about wine and roses and candlelight
But I'm gettin' all from you with every town that I play
Maybe this distance is more than we can take

Somewhere in East Texas you're out alone
But I can't dry tears on the telephone
But I'm comin' back to you I swear I'll make it right
I'm makin' my way back home on a red-eye midnight flight

Ooh baby here I'm comin' home
'Cause I can't love you on the telephone
Ooh darlin I swear I'll make it right
No more lonely East Texas nights
No more lonely East Texas nights

Two, three, four!

Ooh baby here I'm comin' home
'Cause I can't love you on the telephone
Ooh darlin I swear I'll make it right
No more lonely East Texas nights
No more lonely East Texas nights

Ooh baby here I'm comin' home
'Cause I can't love you on the telephone
Ooh darlin I swear I'll make it right
No more lonely East Texas nights
