Hey Predator, what do you say?
Did you land a girl half your age?
Hey Predator, what do you say?
The tables are turned, now you’re the prey

Taking out the trash
Leave it on the front porch step
Thought you were god
Bitch you’re just a lost prophet
And I’ll stop dropping names
When you stop using fame
To prey on pretty little girls like a sick fucking game
What can you pull with the leverage you got?
You’re in the limelight now, but the cameras flashing for your mugshot
Smile, blue ribbon for the P.I.G
Take him out to the slaughter house, it’s time for you to D.I.E

Hey Predator, what do you say?
Did you land a girl half your age?
Hey Predator, what do you say?
The tables are turned, now you’re the prey

Write a rhyme not a pick up line, punk
Give me that pen
I don’t want to hear a verse about you and a girl
And how she is your new best friend
Oh how it’s “Hard to handle” the heat from your scandal
Couldn’t wait for an 18th candle, now I’m gonna make you an example
It’s crazy how sympathetic people are with your ways
You should have been a lawyer, ‘cause you can talk for days
Smile, blue ribbon for the P.I.G
Take him out to the slaughter house, it’s time for you to D.I.E
Can’t hide in your brick house pussy
D.I.E.P.I.G
Can’t hide in your brick house pussy
D.I.E.P.I.G

Hey Predator, what do you say?
Did you land a girl half your age?
Hey Predator, what do you say?
The tables are turned, now you’re the prey

Hey Predator, what do you say?
Can’t hide in your brick house, Pussy
Hey Predator, what do you say?
D.I.E.P.I.G
