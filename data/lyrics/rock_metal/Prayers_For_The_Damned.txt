<<<<<<< HEAD
When I wake up to the sound of demons
They're always telling me that I'm no good
And all the angels keep scratching at my door
I'm doing what I can to fight this anger
I'm just a product of a living hell
And I don't wanna live like this no more
Everything is crumbling in my head
Sometimes I wish I was

But maybe I'm not alone
Maybe if you take my hand
And I reach up to God
Maybe this time he'll say a prayer for the damned
What have I got to lose
When I've already lost it all
Maybe this time he'll say a prayer for
Say a prayer for the damned
For the damned

Have you ever been abused by someone
So blue that it chills your soul?
Have you ever been afraid of your own ghost?
I'm just a creature of a broken past
We're all looking for a second chance
And I don't wanna live like this no more
And all the madness rages in my head
Sometimes I wish I was

But maybe I'm not alone
Maybe if you take my hand
And I reach up to God
Maybe this time he'll say a prayer for the damned
What have I got to lose
When I've already lost it all?
Maybe this time he'll say a prayer for
Say a prayer for the damned

We are not alone
It's darkest before the hope
Well, you and I, we're not alone

Maybe I'm not alone
Maybe if you take my hand
And I reach up to God
Maybe this time he'll say a prayer for the damned
What have we got to lose
When we've already lost it all?
Maybe this time he'll say a prayer for
Say a prayer for the damned
For the damned
(Say a prayer for the damned)
