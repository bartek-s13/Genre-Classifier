When morning breaks
We hide our eyes and our love's aching
Nothing's strange
It was in our hands from 6 to 10
It slipped right out again

There'll be no better time
There'll be no better way
There'll be no better day to save me
Save me
Yeah, save me
I hope you see like I see
I hope you see what I see
I hope you feel like I feel

And the world don't stop
There is no time for cracking up
Believe me friend
Cause when freedom comes
I'll be long gone
You know it has to end

There'll be no better time
There'll be no better way
There'll be no better day to save me
Save me
Yeah, save me

Weeping willow
The pills under my pillow
Weeping willow
The Gun under your pillow
Weeping willow
