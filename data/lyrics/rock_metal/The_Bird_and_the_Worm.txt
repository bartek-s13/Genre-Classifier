He wears his heart safety-pinned to his backpack
His backpack is all that he knows
Shot down by strangers whose glances can cripple
The heart and devour the soul

All alone
He turns to stone while holding his breath half to death
Terrified of what's inside
To save his life, he crawls, like a worm from a bird
(All alone)
Crawls, like a worm from a bird

Out of his mind, the weight pushes him whispering
Must have been out of his mind
Mid-day delusions of pushing this out of his head
Maybe out of his mind (out of his mind)

All alone
He turns to stone while holding his breath half to death
Terrified of what's inside
To save his life, he crawls, like a worm
(Crawls, like a worm)
Crawls, like a worm from a bird
(All alone)
Crawls like a worm from a bird
(All alone)
Crawls like a worm from a bird
(All alone)
Crawls like a worm
Crawls like a worm from a bird

All he knows
If he can't relieve it, it grows
And so it goes
He crawls, like a worm
Crawls, like a worm from a bird

And he crawls like a worm
He crawls like a worm
He crawls like a worm
Crawls like a...

Out of his mind
The weight pushes him, whispering
Must have been out of his mind

All alone
He turns to stone while holding his breath half to death
Terrified of what's inside
To save his life, he crawls, like a worm from a bird
All alone
He turns to stone while holding his breath half to death
Terrified
To save his life, he crawls, like a worm from a bird
(Crawls, like a worm)
Crawls, like a worm from a bird
(All alone)
Crawls like a worm from a bird
(All alone)
Crawls like a worm from a bird
(All alone)
Crawls like a worm
Crawls like a worm
Crawls like a worm from a bird

(All alone)
(All alone)
(All alone)
(All alone)
