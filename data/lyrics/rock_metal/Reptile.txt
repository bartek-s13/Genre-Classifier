In here a tale of a boy who reached the masses
His name was Billy and he liked to get high
A normal guy until the green-skin apocalypse
A do or die

There must be something in the water (Besides fluoride and shit) Where he lie, where he lie
He threw that gaping brain asunder when he realized, when he realized
It's coming down

We've sown thrones and brought the kings down to knees
Hello, here we are, salutations
And every day that you wake is a gift that you take from the gods
That's right
You came from the trees and we altered the genes
Here you are, all you fuck with is wages
You had the day but you pissed it away
I think it's time that we show our ways

Now we shed that violence all over
Let mayhem in the streets
From the mountaintop to oceans, we own your every need
It's coming down
With every breath that we take we can hear that sound
Somebody needs a reaction to stay on the ground
With every breath that we take we can hear that sound
A green-skin apocalypse
A do or die
So Billy heeds the call of fathers
Release high
Through these eyes

Embraces the chi and he praises the weeds
Holding out for the day he can face them
And every day that he trains is a slap in the face to the gods
Goddamn
Shutting out politics
Viewing beings as equals
Ain't it funny how that makes sense?
You had the floor, but you gave it a bore
Now it's equal
Can we clean that slate?

Now shed that violence all over
Let mayhem in the streets
From mountain top to oceans, we own your every need
It's coming down
Somebody needs a reaction to stay on the ground
It's coming down

Follow a trail of the ones who bleed the masses
Follow behind the reptilian eyes
A normal day in the green-skin apocalypse
A do or die
There must be something in the water where he lie, where he lie
He threw that gaping brain asunder
When he realized, when he realized

National alliance and he leads the fight
No class, no race, just fucking violence in their eyes
A plan for human survival takes to flight
The good that's left and all we cherish stands to die

Is this the end of all we know?
They all float
Is this the end of all we know?
Wasted our lives for what?
Float away
Do we feed the reaction?
Do we stay?
Do we all float away?

Do you think you know who you are?
Did you think you had it all worked out well?
And who could believe those dead-eyed soldiers?
Red sky rainfall
The winter beams no beauty
Just cold-eyed monsters and bare branches
You can wail to the moon, but that'll just make things worse
They see you
They see me
They see all
No children in the streets
Where do they play when freedom here has been revoked?
The ground which all their fathers soaked
No medicine
The scarcity of nourishment is evident

And where's our god?
Have we seen that side of heaven yet? No
Rich, poor
Clutching to their sheets in horror
Is there an answer?
Is there somebody who can take away all the present dismay?
Bury the light
Pray through night
Mayhem in the streets
No order
Is there an answer?
Is there somebody who can take away all the present dismay?
Bury the light
Pray through night

You've buried that, buried that light
Now pray through night
What has come down is littered all around in your sight
It's littered in your sight


The claim they stake
A land from us they take
The claim they stake (They stake)
A land from us they take (They take)
The craft he shakes
A race within his wake
Victory alone became his above the soil we know
A grave is laid
A man within its cage
Victory alone became his down in the soil he owns
(Soil we know becomes our own home)
Soil we know becomes our own home
Now we're staring at the ground together
This is not the first time or the last time
(Soil we know becomes our own home
Now we're staring at the ground together)
Now we're staring at the ground together

Soil we own becomes ours
Order back in what we know
Soil we own becomes ours
Now one with the soil we own
Soil we own becomes ours
Order back in what we know
Soil we own becomes ours
