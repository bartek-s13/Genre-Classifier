Well it's Saturday night and I just got paid
Fool about my money, don't try to save
My heart say "Go go, have a time"
'Cause Saturday night, I feel fine

I'm gonna rock it up
I'm gonna rip it up
I'm gonna shake it up
Gonna ball it up
I'm gonna rock it up
And ball tonight

Well along about ten I'll be flying high
Rock on out unto the sky
'Cause I don't care if I spend my dough
Tonight I'm gonna be one happy soul

I'm gonna rock it up
I'm gonna rip it up
I'm gonna shake it up
Gonna ball it up
I'm gonna rock it up
And ball tonight

Well it got me a date and I won't be late
Picked her up in my 88
Shag on down by the Union hall
When the joint starts jumping I'll have a ball

I'm gonna rock it up
I'm gonna rip it up
I'm gonna shake it up
Gonna ball it up
I'm gonna rock it up
And ball tonight
