If you think like a whore then you're a fucking whore
Plagiarism is the highest form of flattery
Why would you ever want to be like me?
We are all someone else's terrible idea
If you catch the evil twin then why would you keep it alive?
If you feel the fucking daggers then why not just step aside?
You are all bastard children and you've taken it all the wrong way
Keep fooling yourself with your unappreciation
Look into my eyes and know that I can see right through you
I'll erase you from the thoughts and tongues of everyone you know
Even if you apologized to me right now it would mean nothing
Cry to me and beg for mercy all you want, you're fucking dead
I don't care when or why you cry
I just want to be there when you die
I'll be collecting soon
I'll be coming for my payment soon
You're nothing but a fucking pig
And you owe me your life
Vanflip times a thousand
Don't believe the hype
No care ever
