Taking your life meant nothing to you
But it meant everything to me
What if someone heard what you had to say?
You complain about life because you’re scared of living
You need to see both sides of the story before you pass judgment
A cry for help swiftly turns into a release of pain, the suicide option
Nothing left, not even an end note
The seed of damnation was planted at youth
I can’t get your thoughts out of my head, taking your life will never fucking end
Ultimate reaction I have been left with questions suicide of a loved one
Ultimate rejection, I have Been left with questions and guilt to bury
Maybe then you wouldn’t have taken your life that day
There is no care we are all too worried about ourselves
To the ones that were never involved you will never know despair beyond despair
The intoxicating depression has come to consume us all
I can’t get your thoughts out of my head, taking your life will never fucking end
The rush of agony and regret, unlike anything you’ve felt before
To feel so hopeless but you’re not alone
The act of sin is in the eye of the beholder
To feel as if you’re in hell alive but in heaven when you die
The act of sin is in the eye of the beholder
To feel as if you’re in hell alive but in heaven when you die
