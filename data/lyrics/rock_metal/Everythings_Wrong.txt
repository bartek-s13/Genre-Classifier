I don't want to write this 'cause if I do it might be true
No, I can't fight this, I'm never able to get through
I can't deny this and I'll be damned if it's not you who told me
"I want you to need me"
And you left so none of it was true

How many times did you lie?
You'd tell me anything
To hide this 'til you said goodbye

And now everything's wrong
It's been so long
Am I the man that I promised to be?
Did I let you down, tarnish your crown?
'Cause everything is wrong, everything is wrong

So please believe me, when I say this was in vain
I trusted naively, let you go on with your charade
You'll just deceive me, I didn't try to make you stay, you told me
You're planning to leave me, then you left but none of that was

How many times did you lie?
You'd tell me anything
To hide this 'til you said goodbye
And now everything's wrong
It's been so long
Am I the man that I promised to be?
Did I let you down, tarnish your crown?
'Cause everything is wrong, everything is wrong

Am I the man that I promised to be?
Did I let you down, tarnish your crown?
'Cause everything is wrong, everything is wrong
Everything is wrong
