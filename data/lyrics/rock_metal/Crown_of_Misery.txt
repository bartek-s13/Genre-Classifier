<<<<<<< HEAD
This crown of misery
No remorse, no sympathy
In my absence, I am reborn
As good as fucking dead
We are down but not done yet
The hope I see for what I seek is never lost in me
Let these words be known to you:
I will not rest until we're through
Time and time again you deny
So now we defy
There will be hell to pay
This crown of misery
No remorse, no sympathy
I see you as the enemy
But I've learned to control my aggression
This void in me you'll never see
It's as dead as you are to me
Not all that's lost is never found
The fear will leave you crippled on the ground
Clawing at the wounds you thought would never heal
I will not rest until you feel what I feel
Take your last breath and set me free
I will not rest until you feel what I feel
Take your last breath, before us you will kneel
There will be hell to pay
This crown of misery
No remorse, no sympathy
I see you as the enemy
But I've learned to control my aggression
This void in me you'll never see
It's as dead as you are to me
It's our mistake
We let you in again
Staring through blistered eyes
Nothing you say will change the way I feel
Make no mistake
This void in me you'll never see
Staring through blistered eyes
