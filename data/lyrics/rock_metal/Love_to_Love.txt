Oh it's been too many times, and I can't go back
Night bars, guitars, rundown motels like shacks
What it mounts up to, I don't want it at all
Lost you, and I want you today

Misty green and blue
Love to, love to, love you
Misty green and blue
Love to, love to, love you

To be somethin', to be near you
Don't say that you'll never know
Love to, love to, love you


Half the time it could seem funny
The other half is just too sad
This west bound moon's only rise and fall
Lost you and I want you today

Misty green and blue
Love to, love to, love you
Misty green and blue
Love to, love to, love you

To be something, to be near you
I don't know where I'm goin' to
