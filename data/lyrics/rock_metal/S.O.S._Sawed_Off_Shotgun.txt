Mother, I don't wanna take my medicine
24 years in the gutter again, I'm losing it
I'm losing it

Everybody's acting like they're all alright
I can barely get myself to sleep at night, I'm sick of it
Yeah, I'm sick of it

Yeah, they sent the taxman
I lost my job, and
You got hooked on oxycodone
They shut the lights off
They took the car, and
I bought a sawed-off shotgun
Yeah, they sent the taxman
I lost my job, and
You got hooked on oxycodone
They shut the lights off
They took the car, and
I bought a sawed-off shotgun

I'd rather be crazy than to take these pills
I'm sick of being okay against my will
I'm losing it, I'm losing it

Ain't a thing in this world that I'm gonna miss
It's all fake smiles and leather jackets
We're full of it, yeah, we're full of shit

I don't know who to trust, ooh

Yeah, they sent the taxman
I lost my job, and
You got hooked on oxycodone

I don't know who to trust
Mainly people like us
