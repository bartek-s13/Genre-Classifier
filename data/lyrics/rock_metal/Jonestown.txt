No love, no peace
Spend your days, counting sheep
When you're dead you're done when you're dead you die
And life goes on
Born low, no lives
Waisting your days, waiting to die
I wouldn't mind if you never woke up again
Goodbye my friend
No hopes, no dreams
Breaking away from reality
Today is the day you see the consequence
Where you never wake up again
I will walk even after I'm dead
I will bring the dead to life
When they put a price on your head
Say goodbye to your wonderful life
I have seen the lying face of God
I have seen the edge of the Earth
We have already lived too fucking long
May we regret our birth
I was born a monster
We will die the same
No one can live forever
I will become a household name
Born low, no lives
Wasting your days, waiting to die
I wouldn't mind if you never woke up again
Goodbye my friend
No hopes, no dreams
Breaking away from reality
Today is the day you see the consequence
Where you never wake up again
We will choke the ones we love
We will choke the ones we love
Your administration means nothing to us
When push comes to fucking shove
We never what's expected of us
We all want to be apart of something
But I'm sure you want none of this
We lived our lives afraid to die
But these dreams are selfish
I hate everything you love
(x4)
Born low, no lives
Wasting your days, waiting to die
I wouldn't mind if you never woke up again
Goodbye my friend
No hopes, no dreams
Breaking away from reality
Today is the day you see the consequence
