<<<<<<< HEAD
Here I lay (Still and breathless)
Just like always (Still, I want some more)
Mirrors sideways (Who cares what's behind?)
Just like always (Still your passenger)
(Chrome buttons, buckles, and leather surfaces
These and other lucky witnesses)
Now to calm me (This time, won't you, please?)
Drive faster

Roll the windows down
This cool night air is curious
Let the whole world look in
Who cares who sees anything?
I'm your passenger
I'm your passenger

Drop these down, then put them on me
Nice, cool seats there to cushion your knees
Now to calm me (Take me around again)
Just don't pull over (This time, would you, please?)
Drive faster

Roll the windows down
This cool night air is curious
Let the whole world look in
Who cares who sees what tonight?
Roll these misty windows down
To catch my breath again
And then go and go and go just drive me
Home then back again
Here I lay just like always
Don't let me go
