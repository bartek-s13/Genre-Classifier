In waves, we were born into the reckoning
In death, you will hear it when the tide sings
Red sails, set until the very end
Blood stains, this is my revenge
Will I find the answer, or will I fall at their feet?
This time I’m unable, to rest the anger within me
They gave their lives for a debt that's mine, so I’ll give them a life remembered
No surrender, no survivors
This won’t make it right but it will end their lives
No surrender, no survivors
This won’t make it right but it will end their lives
So hold tight, make way, our final fight is today
In waves, we were born into the reckoning
In death, you will hear it when the tide sings
Red sails, set until the very end
Blood stains, this is my revenge
Blood spilled upon these waves
Will bring us closer to the sun
No surrender, no survivors
This won’t make it right but it will end their lives
No surrender, no survivors
This won’t make it right but it will end their lives
So hold tight, make way, our final fight is today
In waves, we were born into the reckoning
In death, you will hear it when the tide sings
Red sails, set until the very end
Blood stains, this is my revenge
In waves, we were born into the reckoning
In death, you will hear it when the tide sings
Red sails, set until the very end
