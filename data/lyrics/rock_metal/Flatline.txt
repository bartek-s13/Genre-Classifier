<<<<<<< HEAD
Your eyes judge like a jury locked in a trial
No respect for the odd and innocent
Guilty, now shut the doors and then open fire
Some fail to make the connection and lose beauty in a mound of rejection
Can’t we understand that no life is out of our hands?
Suffocation and the fear of living setting in so let go
Let go before he lets go
Patience is wearing thin and leaving him so let go
Let go before he lets go of this life
I wonder what goes on before he lets go, he says:

"Send an angel to pull me from the hell below
This weight is far too much to own and this body doesn’t feel like home
Send an angel, I feel I’m dying all alone
So lift me up or let me go, because this body doesn’t feel like home
No, this body doesn’t feel like home
No"

Love feels far away
The lack of motivation keeps his soul from bettering his own life
Now he’s next level with a bottle and a blade retreating in his own way
Suffocation and the fear of living setting in so let go
Let go before he lets go
Patience is wearing thin and leaving him so let go
Let go before he lets go of this life
I wonder what goes on behind those bloodshot eyes
I wonder what goes on before he lets go, he says:
"Send an angel to pull me from the hell below
This weight is far too much to own and this body doesn’t feel like home
Send an angel, I feel I’m dying all alone
So lift me up or let me go because this body doesn’t feel like home"

Sleep now and carry on into the black of the night
Sleep now and you’ll be on your way
There’s another one moving on from the flatline, flatline
Sleep now and carry on into the black of the night
Sleep now and you’ll be on your way
There’s another one moving on from the flatline, flatline
Slip into the fray, slip between the night and day
Sleep now and carry on into the black of the night
At peace with everything, but it doesn’t make it right
There’s another one moving on from the flatline, flatline
Sleep now, sleep now and carry on another night
At peace with everything, but it doesn’t make it right
