Get up
Out of your cave and into the fire
Time is short, this is our last resort
To get through to you, what have I got to do?
Who's going to be the difference?
If not us
Then who?
If not us, then who?
If not us, then who?
Sound off
Take a look at your life, tell me to what do you aspire?
I want to know how far you're willing to go
Can't stop the force of ruin, this world will run through you
If not now, then when?
If not us, then who?
If not us, then who?
If not us, then who?
If not us, then who?
