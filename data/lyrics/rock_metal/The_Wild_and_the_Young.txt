Times are changing, nothing stays the same
For this jukebox generation
Adhere to fashion like computer games
Modern day communication

The news hard to take will fade tomorrow
They are the strong, they'll survive

The wild and the young, they all have their dreams
The wild and the young, they got to be free
The sun never sets for souls on the run
The wild and the young, yeah

Roaring passion with no guilt or shame
It's accepting education, yeah
Misbehaving, no regrets, no blame
With a bold kind of sophistication

So close to the edge and high on the wire
They are not wrong, they're alive
The wild and the young, they all have their dreams
The wild and the young, they got to be free
The sun never sets for souls on the run
The wild and the young


So close to the edge and high on the wire
They are not wrong, they're alive
Look out
Wild, wild
The wild and the young, y-y-y-y-young

The wild and the young, they all have their dreams
The wild and the young, they got to be free
The sun never sets for souls on the run
The wild and the young, they all have their dreams
The wild and the young, they got to be free
The sun never sets for souls on the run
The wild and the young

The wild and the young
