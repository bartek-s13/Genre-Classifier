One's and zero's fill my eyes
Am I supposed to be like everybody else?
A prisoner of my own mind
Should I give up?
Should I give up?

I try to smile, try to fight
Just say I'm okay
But every day feels like a hurricane

Yeah, I was born in the rain
Yeah, I was born in the rain

Answers never seemed so distant
The fear of missing out blurs my vision
Am I enough to live up to the expectations of a world
That won't stop moving?
I am so lost in the eye of the storm
I am so lost

But I try to smile, try to fight
Just say I'm okay
But everyday feels like a hurricane

Yeah, I was born in the rain
Yeah, I was born in the rain

Tell me what I need!
So tell me what I need
The water's rising past my eyes!
So tell me what I need
The water's rising past my eyes!

The rain pours down
The clouds block the light
I can't find the help I need
Let this destroy me

Let this destroy me

I try to smile, try to fight
Just say I'm okay
But every day feels like it's killing me

Yeah, I was born in the rain
Yeah, I was born in the rain

So tell me what I need
The water's rising past my eyes!
So tell me what I need
The water's rising past my eyes!
So tell me what I need
The water's rising past my eyes!
So tell me what I need
