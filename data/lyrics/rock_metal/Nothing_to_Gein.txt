Cold and silent, soiled face I will wash it all away
With my love
That's all
She's ever needed, from me
It's my time, to mother
One of my own in my
Life
I am so alone, left with no one
In my life, I'm
So alone
 Life submissiveness
Hypnotizing the ignorant a little boy's best friend's
Always his
Mother
At least that's what she said
Life of a simple
Man
Taught that everyone else is dirty
And their love is meaningless
I'm just a soiled dirty boy
I'm just a soiled dirty boy
 Sheltered life innocence
Insulated memories, spark reflections of my
Head
Duality in my consciousness
Caught in the war of hemispheres
Between the love lost in my head
Mommy do you still live inside of me
I'm
So lost in my life without any
Guiding
Protected me my whole life from
Everything
Nailed shut the doors to the shrine
To screen your dead eyes
From me and my sickness
Mutilate and sew my new clothes for masquerading
Aprons of flesh corpse scalped hair with skin upon my face
 Deliver the remains from her womb of earth
Prep the rack and tie up for
New love's rebirth
Covert understanding of novice surgery
I'll focus
Concentration and only take just what I need
For sickness I'm masticating
Dancing and masturbating
Celebrate in fields of night with skin upon my
Face
 If I soak my hands in others blood am I sick
If I wash my hands in others
Blood am I sick
If I drench myself in others blood am I sick
If I bathe
Myself in others blood
 Blame mother for the sickness
Mutilate and sew my new clothes for
Masquerading
Aprons of flesh corpse scalped hair with skin upon my face
Dance and masturbate in night light by myself..
 Nothing is left for me to gain they're coming to take me far
Away
 
 Life of a simple man taught that everyone else is dirty and love is
Meaningless
I'm so soiled
Soiled
