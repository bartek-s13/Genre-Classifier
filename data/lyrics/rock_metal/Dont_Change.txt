<<<<<<< HEAD
I'm standing here on the ground
The sky above won't fall down
See no evil in all directions
Resolution of happiness
Things have been dark
For too long
Don't change for you
Don't change a thing for me
Don't change for you
Don't change a thing for me
I found a love I had lost
It was gone for too long
Hear no evil in all directions
Execution of bitterness
Message received loud and clear
Don't change for you
Don't change a thing for me
Don't change for you
Don't change a thing for me
I'm standing here on the ground
The sky above won't fall down
See no evil in all directions
Resolution of happiness
Things have been dark for too long
Don't change for you
Don't change a thing for me
Don't change for you
Don't change a thing for me
Don't change for you
Don't change a thing for me
Don't change
