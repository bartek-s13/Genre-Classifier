See me fade away
Gone tomorrow but dead today
I know it's all about the pain...
Love me 'til the end
Stab the back of your bestfriend, I know..
Cuz I have done the same...
I have done the same!
Drinks for everyone, raise a toast
Break every bone you own...
I love to play that game
I need some time to be all alone with you and me
Let's go - Cuz everything's the same
You're something beautiful
You're something beautiful
(And we know)
It's me you're looking for
It's me you're looking for when you fall
You're something beautiful
You're something beautiful
(And we know)
It's time to break the cycle
Better give in to a million rifles...
See me fade away
Love the sorrow and dig the grave
I know, it's all about the pain...
Learn me how to be more like you
And less like meI hope that I can be the same
(If I just want to be the same)
You're something beautiful
You're something beautiful
(And we know)
It's me you're looking for
It's me you're looking for when you fall
You're something beautiful
You're something beautiful
(And we know)
It's time to break the cycle
Better give in to a million rifles...
'lso they all decided to let me go
Cuz a bad boy that ain't me now
I'm not like them and they're not like me
Let's agree to disagree...
Now, my mama told me when I was young
"Wounds can be healed...
It depends on what you want to do
It depends on how you feel"
So how do ya feel!? With a million rifles?
Among a million souls?
Better give in to a million rifles
You're something beautiful
You're something beautiful
It's me you're looking for
It's me you're looking for when you fall
You're something beautiful
You're something beautiful
(And we know)
It's time to break the cycle
Better give in to a million rifles...
