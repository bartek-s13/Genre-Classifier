I can't take your fucking faces
Cut one head off two grow in its place
The laughter is not worth
Walking Garbage all over the Earth
Now you're a Christian
Now she's a beauty queen
I hope you die together
Your lives are jokes to me
You are not a hero
You are not a martyr
If I believed in God
I would call you the Anti-christ
You are not a hero
You are not a martyr
(x2)
OH
The hills have eyes
Your life is a lie
The hills have eyes
Your life is a lie
The world will celebrate
Your fall from grace
Half the world wants to
Spit in your face
The world will celebrate
Your fall from grace
Half the world wants to
Spit in your face
You're not a 10
You're a five plus twenty grand
Paris fucking Hilton wants you dead
Enough said...
Now you're a Christian
Now she's a beauty queen
I hope you die together
Your lives are jokes to me
The hills have eyes
Your life is a lie
The hills have eyes
Your life is a lie
OH
The hills have eyes
Your life is a lie
Ra!
