You said that you'd rather
Spend your time with another
The hearts of my brothers are on the floor

I bet you wish that you bothered
When this band gets discovered
Don't worry yeah we recovered
And this ones for you

We could be way up
We could be on top
If it weren't for shit like you
We could be way up
We could be on top
If it weren't for shit like you

When you're in your car with your driver
You'll hear how we blew up like a bonfire
God knows we're survivors
We won't stop until we get more

I bet you wish that you bothered
When this band gets uncovered
Don't worry yeah we recovered
And this one's for you

We could be way up
We could be on top
If it weren't for shit like you
We could be way up
We could be on top
If it weren't for shit like you

If it weren't for shit like you
We could be way up
If it weren't for shit like you
We could be on top
If it weren't for shit like you

We could be way up
We could be on top
If it weren't for shit like you
We could be way up
We could be on top
If it weren't for shit like you
