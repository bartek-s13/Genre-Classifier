<<<<<<< HEAD
I buried the judgment...
I covered my tracks!
Soon to be forgotten...
There’s a new life ahead!
It was my hope that was fading...
I was caught in a trap!
It's the burden of failure...
I carried on my back!

Let's get this straight
A lot has changed in the last year
Thought I had everything together but watched it all disappear
I put my faith in the wrong things
When I woke up, it was gone, I gave up on me!
Didn't even recognize myself
Self-worth is not found in someone else
Chase what you want, never give up!
Salt the wound; all ties are cut

And now I see, I was broken to be made a better me
Had to learn to let it go and let it be
Sometimes we’re too blind to see!
Go!

The hardest lessons that we learn
Are the ones where knowledge must be earned
It's what makes us human, it's what gets us through it

Weighed down by the pressures of saving face
This is a dark world, I’ll be your witness
Witness

And now I see, I was broken to be made a better me
Had to learn to let it go and let it be
Sometimes we’re too blind to see!

Learn to let it go and let it be
Learn to let it go and let it, be
Learn to let it go and let it be
