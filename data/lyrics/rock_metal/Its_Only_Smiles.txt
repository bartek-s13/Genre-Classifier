We've all got those things crawling under what they perceive
We know sharp fangs and they chew in the tide alone

My gut is telling me, oh, it's telling me why
She'd rather see a man up than me under
Rip a hole in my life, but no matter the things I do, never get over it
I said goodbye from a place so far
I'm under the truth
Because words mean nothing to fleeting youth
Rip a hole in my life when it's bringing me back to you

I've been trying to work it out
Gotta get away, get away from the sights and sounds
Keep it on the ground
I don't wanna be, but just carry on and smile on through it
Death is true and I'll be missing you (I'll be missing you)

Advice is not always right
So I've gone to tread my ways
The path I've laid out is tied
We're always meant to shine
You left a lot of grief
Now it's bleeding out my teeth
Shot holes in every stone heart, oh
The tones are on repeat, yet nothing's filling me
It's on my chest and you're in this art

Death is true and I'll be missing you
Death is true and I'll be missing you
(Death is true and I'll be missing you)
I think I'll just smile through it all for you
