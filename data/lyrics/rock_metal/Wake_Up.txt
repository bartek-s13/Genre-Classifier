Oh o-oh, Wake up!
Oh o-oh, Wake up!

All we know is time
It's slipping from our lives
A world that kept the truth
Hidden in the lies
Standing on the stage
Bleeding out our youth
Create a holy war
And sell it back to you

We'll shout it from the tallest building

We, won't let them turn away
We'll show them what they made
We'll be here when their heart stops beating
We the nation of today
Our hearts that never fade
We'll be here when the heart stops beating
Oh o-oh, Wake up!
Oh o-oh, Wake up!

See it in our eyes
That we were never blind
I will fight for you
Until the day I die

We'll shout it from the tallest building

We, won't let them turn away
We'll show them what they made
We'll be here when their heart stops beating
We the nation of today
Our hearts that never fade
We'll be here when the heart stops beating
We, won't let them turn away
We'll show them what they made
We'll be here when their heart stops beating
We the nation of today
Our hearts that never fade
We'll be here when the heart stops beating
We, won't let them turn away
We'll show them what they made
We'll be here when their heart stops beating
We the nation of today
Our hearts that never fade
We'll be here when the heart stops beating
Oh o-oh, Wake up!
Oh o-oh, Wake up!
Oh o-oh, wake up!
