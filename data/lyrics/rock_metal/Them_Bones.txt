Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!

I believe them bones are me
Some say we're born into the grave

I feel so alone
Gonna end up a big ole pile of them bones

Aah! Aah! Aaah!

Dust rise right on over my time
Empty fossil of the new scene

I feel so alone
Gonna end up a big ole pile of them bones

Yeah!
Toll due, bad dream come true
I lie dead gone under red sky

I feel so alone
Gonna end up a big ole pile of them...
I feel so alone
Gonna end up a big ole pile of them...
I feel so alone
