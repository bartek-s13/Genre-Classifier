<<<<<<< HEAD
You say it was this morning when you last saw your good friend
Lying on the pavement with a misery on his brain
Stoned on some new potion he found upon the wall
Of some unholy bathroom in some ungodly hall
He only had a dollar to live on till next Monday
But he spent it all on comfort for his mind
Did you say you think he's blind?
Someone should call his parents, a sister or a brother
And they'll come to take him back home on a bus
But he'll always be a problem to his poor and puzzled mother
Yeah he'll always be another one of us
He said he wanted heaven but prayin' was too slow
So he bought a one-way ticket on an airline made of snow
Did you say you saw your good friend flyin' low?
Flyin' low, dyin' slow
You say it was this morning when you last saw your good friend
Lying on the pavement with a misery on his brain
Stoned on some new potion he found upon the wall
Of some unholy bathroom in some ungodly hall
He only had a dollar to live on till next Monday
He said he wanted heaven but prayin' was too slow
So he bought a one-way ticket on an airline made of snow
Did you say you saw your good friend flyin' low?
Dyin' slow, flyin' low
Did you say you saw your good friend flyin' low?
Dyin' slow, flyin' low
