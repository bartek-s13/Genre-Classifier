<<<<<<< HEAD
I get up in the morning and it's just another day
Pack up my belongings, I've got to get away
Jump into a taxi and the time is gettin' tight
I got to keep on movin' I got a show tonight
And I'm movin' on, movin' on from town to town
Movin' on, baby, yeah I'm never touchin' the ground
Yeah. I check into the ticket desk with half an' hour to go
Headin' for the boarding gate, I'm feelin' pretty low
Fifteen minutes later, I'm sittin' on my plane
Fastened in my safety belt I'm takin' off again
And I'm movin' on, movin' on from town to town
Movin' on, baby, yeah I'm never touchin' the ground
And I'm movin' on, movin' on from town to town
Movin' on, I can't seem to stop now
I got to move on, move on from town to town
I got to move on, and I never seem to slow down
Oh, I got to move on, move on from town to town
I got to move on, I never seem to slow down, oh yeah
