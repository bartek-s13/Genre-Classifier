<<<<<<< HEAD
What I have in me, in my mind is you
I would die if we were through
What I'm feeling now, what I'm heading into
I am lost in pain without you
(So cold, so alone)

All I have is you
It is all that I'm breathing for
All I need is you
Now I can't make it through

All the nights I've prayed, must this all be untrue?
I am not prepared to be strong
I just can't believe I am losing you
Unprepared to carry on, I can't see you walk away
(So cold, so alone)

All I have is you
It is all that I'm breathing for
All I need is you
Now I can't make it through
I am losing you forever
I am lost in pain without you
I am leaving ground forever (Forever)
Distant, so far, destiny is selecting me
I can't be strong, life is disconnecting me now
Loneliness infecting me
Gone are the days you were there protecting me
So cold, so alone

All I have is you
It is all that I'm breathing for
All I need is you
Now I can't make it through
I am losing you forever
I am lost in pain without you
I am leaving ground forever (Forever)

All I have is you
It is all that I'm breathing for
All I need is you
Now I can't make it through

It is all that I'm breathing for
(Breathing for, breathing for)
