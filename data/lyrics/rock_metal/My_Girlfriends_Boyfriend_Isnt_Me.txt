Ha Ha...Let me tell you a story
It's a rocky road that's on a roll
When he makes his move it takes it's toll
When she looks back I lose control
They talk so secretly, and I know what it means
My girlfriend's boyfriend isn't me
Her mind is stuck on "wait and see"
I hope it's temporarily
My girlfriend's boyfriend isn't me
Like a bad habit she can't break
The more she gives the more he takes
She's walkin' into a mistake
It happens easily, and I know what it means
My girlfriend's boyfriend isn't me
Her mind is stuck on "wait and see"
I hope it's temporarily
My girlfriend's boyfriend isn't me
You know it makes me feel so bad
To know her kids won't call me dad
She was the best I ever had
Her kind of lovin' drives me mad
They say three's company, and I know what it means
My girlfriend's boyfriend isn't me
Her mind is stuck on "wait and see"
Well, I know it's temporarily
(My girlfriend's boyfriend isn't me)
My girlfriend's boyfriend isn't me
(My girlfriend's boyfriend isn't me)
My girlfriend's boyfriend isn't me
(My girlfriend's boyfriend isn't me)
My girlfriend's boyfriend isn't me
My girlfriend's boyfriend isn't me
