The cogs keep turning
The earth keeps burning down
They gotta fuel the war machine
Crude oil and kerosene
A constant need a hate to feed in a world that's bleeding out
Catastrophe, epanastrophe; a never ending cycle
An enterprise built on lies, an eternal industry
For the wheels to turn, the world must burn
Burn it to the ground

Always wanting more and more
Living the nightmare just to feed the dream
Spoiling the wealthy, depriving the poor
Make war to fuel the machine

Filthy production
Twisted destructive minds
Does it get you of?
Arm the troops, it's feeding time
Devour
Supply to demand
Create to destroy
Feed the fucking machine
Go
Devour
For the wheels to turn, the world must burn
Burn it to the ground

Always wanting more and more
Living the nightmare just to feed the dream
Spoiling the wealthy, depriving the poor
Make war to fuel the machine

A thirst for bloodshed, the hungry man
Ever eternal war machine
Unstoppable

Stop this train, let's derail the monster
The Iron Prince, cannot cease the breathe
Only flames can ignite the fire
Annihilating the war machine
