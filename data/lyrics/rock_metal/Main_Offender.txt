I'm on my way
Can't settle down
I'm stuck in ways of being an ass
And I got a lot of nerve that I'm ready to pass
I'm on my way
Can't settle down
Stuck in ways of sadistic joy
And my talent only goes as far as to annoy
I'm on my way

This is my main offender
This is what I've got and it got me saying
Why me?

I'm on my way
I get around
But I'm not all too sure about what I do
I feel I've got to stop a second just to think it through
And so I stop!

I'm on my way
Yeah I get around
Yeah I thought it all over and now I spit it out
And when I spit, I spit on those that I care less about
I'm on my way

This is my main offender
This is what I've got and it got me saying
Why me?

I'm on my way
