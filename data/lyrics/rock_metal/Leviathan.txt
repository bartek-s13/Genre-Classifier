Leviathan, where are you now?
My secret friend from the underground
Bring your waves and the thunder
Make me believe forevermore
Outside my window, I can see
The ocean where you used to be
Horns that sprout out from your head
A glowing light near the surface

Leviathan, open your eyes
I cannot save the world's demise
All alone with no armor
Your burning eyes shine from under

You said that you and I
Could make 'em all terrified
And clean up the whole world

Leviathan, open your eyes
Leviathan, open your eyes, woah-oh-oh-oh
Leviathan, open your eyes
Leviathan, open your eyes, woah-oh-oh-oh

Remember once upon a time
Nobody loved you more than I
Our secret place is in danger
Wake up, king of the creatures
Outside my window, I can see
The ocean where you used to be
Horns that sprout out from your head
A glowing light near the surface

You said that you and I
Could make 'em all terrified
And clean up the whole world

Leviathan, open your eyes
Leviathan, open your eyes, woah-oh-oh-oh
Leviathan, open your eyes
Leviathan, open your eyes, woah-oh-oh-oh


Under the blackened sky
When a firestorm lit up the ocean overnight
So we meet again
But this time we step out of our dreams with open eyes
Now that it's said and done
Can we make this world a better place for everyone?
For everyone

You said that you and I
Could make 'em all terrified
And clean up the whole world

Leviathan, open your eyes
Leviathan, open your eyes, woah-oh-oh-oh
Leviathan, open your eyes
Leviathan, open your eyes, woah-oh-oh-oh
