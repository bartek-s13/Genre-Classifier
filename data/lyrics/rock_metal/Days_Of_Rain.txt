<<<<<<< HEAD
You say you hate to be here
But I don't mind to meet the morning
The colors range from blue to everything
Between the red and green
You swallow needles to feel free
I'm overwhelmed, I need to breathe
It's got to be so damn hard to feel
The way you feel about yourself
You're not alone, you're not alone
And when you're so in love
That you cannot see the pain in you
And the pain in me
The love is blind and we can't deny it
The clouds are dark but we're moving on
You stand up straight but it's been too long
The love is blind and we can't deny it
In the days of rain
You close your eyes to disappear
You can't replace me without fear
The nights are so much longer than before
I don't believe in any stories
I'm the one to blame, my glory dies
How can it be so hard to change
The way you feel about yourself?
Yeah, you're not alone, you're not alone
And when you're so in love
That you cannot see the pain in you
And the pain in me
The love is blind and we can't deny it
The clouds are dark but we're moving on
You stand up straight but it's been too long
The love is blind and we can't deny it
In the days of rain
When you're so in love
In the days of rain
It keeps pouring down
And when you're so in love you're temple breaks
Train of tears and your body aches
Turn around the scars you show
Don't be afraid, you're not alone
It keeps pouring down, yeah
And when you're so in love
That you cannot see the pain in you
And the pain in me
The love is blind and we can't deny it
The clouds are dark but we're moving on
You stand up straight but it's been too long
The love is blind and we can't deny it
The clouds are dark but we're moving on
You stand up straight but it's been too long
The love is blind and we can't deny it
