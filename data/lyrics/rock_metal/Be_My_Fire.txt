Baby, be my fire
Baby, be my flame
Baby, be the softly burning embers
Through December until June calls your name
Baby, be my conjurer
And I'll hold you dear
Baby, be the visions in the night
And wait till morning light for you
To disappear

Baby, be my fire
Baby, be my fire
Baby, be my fire
Oh, be my flame

Well, I heard you whisper
To all your friends
I heard you telling them that
You need a man in whom
You can depend
Well I'd be the gasoline
To keep you alive
And I'd be the coal
So unbreakable
We'd burn together
Straight through the night
And that's alright
Baby, be my fire
Baby, be my fire
Baby, be my fire
Yeah, I'll hold you there
So close
Baby, be my fire
Baby, be my fire
Baby, be my fire
Yeah, I'll hold you there
So close
Baby, be my fire
Baby, be my fire
