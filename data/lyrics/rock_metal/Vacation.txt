My girl is rocking that Billabong bikini like she’s sponsored
Asking me if I can rub that Coppertone on her
Got a couple bucks, but I’m spending them like they pesos
Might be Motel Sixing but it feels like Turks and Caicos

Put a little liquor in my coconut water (Coconut water)
Party all day like you at your alma mater (At your alma mater)
Put a little liquor in my coconut water (Coconut water)
Ice has started melting 'cause it’s always getting hotter

Singing hey, let’s party like we on vacation
Hey, let’s party like we on vacation
I got my toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Singing hey, let’s party like we on vacation

I got my Solo Cup amplifier, playing all my jams
And my Walgreens beach chair working on my tan
Feels like it’s Jamaica and I’m sippin' on some Red Stripe
But I’m in Decatur, baby, crushing on that Busch light
Hey, let’s party like we on vacation
Hey, yeah, let’s party like we on vacation (I got, I got, I got)
Toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Singing hey, let’s party like we on vacation

Put a little liquor in my coconut water
Party all day like you at your alma mater
Put a little liquor in my coconut water
My ice has started melting, so I’ll take another swallow

Singing hey, let’s party like we on vacation
Hey, let’s party like we on vacation
You know I got my toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Singing hey, let’s party like we on vacation

(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Party like I’m on vacation
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Party like I’m on vacation
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Party like I’m on vacation
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
I’m gonna rehydrate, while I dehydrate, you know
Hey, let’s party like we on vacation
Hey, yeah, let’s party like we on vacation
I got my toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Toes up in the sand
Cold one in my hand
Singing hey, let’s party like we on vacation

(Sing it to me)
Hey, let’s party like we on vacation
Hey, party like we on vacation
