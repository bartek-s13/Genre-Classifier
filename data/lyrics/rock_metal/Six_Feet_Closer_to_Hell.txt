<<<<<<< HEAD
If the world's gonna end then let it end
On my knees I'm sick to death
Put that bullet in the barrel
And we know what happens next
This is the end
I feel it in my chest
Laid to rest
If the world's gonna end then let it fucking end
I'll be right here as the flame burns bright
We're all dying in slow motion
Nameless, faceless, and hopeless
Die without hope
Got stuck inside my head
Every word I wrote pushed me closer to the end
Dreams of death just for pretend
A final breath, laid to rest
Six feet closer to hell
God damn
Six feet closer to hell
Six feet closer to hell
A final breath, laid to rest
A final breath, laid to rest
These are words for the hopeless
Only they would understand
Cut us open, torn and broken
Our love feels just like death
Just let me slip away
I only have myself to blame
Let the blood fill my lungs
I hear the dead scream my name
If the world's gonna end then let it fucking end
I'll be right here as the flame burns bright
We're all dying in slow motion
Nameless, faceless, and hopeless
Hopeless, hopeless
Six feet closer to hell
Six feet closer to hell
If the world's gonna end then let it end
On my knees I'm sick to death
Put that bullet in the barrel
And we know what happens next
This is the end
I feel it in my chest
Laid to rest
Die without hope
Got stuck inside my head
Every word I wrote pushed me closer to the end
Dreams of death just for pretend
A final breath, laid to rest
Six feet closer to hell
God damn
Six feet closer to hell
Six feet closer to hell
A final breath, laid to rest
Six feet closer to hell
