<<<<<<< HEAD
I don't know who you are now
Mystery drenches my brain
I want to jump deep into your cloud
Because something tells me it's going to rain

I hear the thunder thumping
And my heart starts jumping
And that's when I spin on the pole
Now my head's exploding
And your gun is loaded
So I'm guessing I'm on a roll
Well it's a fine time
Looking for a wine time man
And you said, "Baby, you ready to play?"
Well, come ride on this roller coaster
Because it ain't over, it ain't over

Rebel of this party
I'm in love with all your danger, danger
We can live forever
I can be your pagan angel, angel
Beautiful Dangerous
You like it smooth like brandy
Savor the flavor with delight
You can be Sid, I'll be Nancy
'Cause sometimes it's more fun to fight

I hear the thunder thumping
And my heart starts jumping
And that's when I spin on the pole
Now my head's exploding
And your gun is loaded
So I'm guessing I'm on a roll
Well it's a fine time
Looking for a wine time man
And you said, "Baby, you ready to play?"
Well, come ride on this roller coaster
Because it ain't over, it ain't over

Rebel of this party
I'm in love with all your danger, danger
We can live forever
I can be your pagan angel, angel
Beautiful Dangerous
Rebel of this party
I'm in love with all your danger, danger
We can live forever
I can be your pagan angel (I'll be your), angel (I'll be your)
Rebel of this party (I'll be your)
I'm in love with all your danger, danger
We can live forever
