Your blood will blanket the Earth
I am the shot heard round the world
We are the atom smashers
We do what can't be done
You are the baby killers
We will explode the sun
You are the masses
We can't be saved
You took your chances
I'll dig your grave
We are the atom smashers
We do what can't be done
You are the baby killers
We will explode the sun
You are the masses
We can't be saved
You took your chances
I'll dig your fucking grave
Your life just fucking disgusts me
No need for you to discuss me
I understand exactly why you don't trust me
I find you fucking disgusting
Drama from the drama hating drama queen
Time to suck today's dick
I hope you choke on it
I hope you choke on it
You spread disease when you spread your legs
Time to suck today's dick
I hope you choke on it
I hope you choke on it
We chewed the fingers to the bone, we can't leave well enough alone
We live in troubled times, don't tell me everything's fine
That's when the roof caved in
That's when your world fell the fuck apart
That's when the roof caved in
That's when your world fell the fuck apart
I saw your world fall apart
