The shaft of daylight melts dirty panes
The stench of life pulls them out from their dreams
Those living wastes on the streets outside
Woken up again with no place to hide
Daily food like shit and beer

The secretions of city mass machine
Sewers running through my veins
(Witold Kieltyka - Drum Solo)
The shaft of daylight melts dirty panes
The stench of life pulls them out from their dreams
Those living wastes on the streets outside
Woken up again with no place to..
