Do you wanna go to heaven tonight?
Leave the evidence far behind
Say alright, alright
Do you wanna be my lover tonight?
We can leave everybody else behind
Say alright, alright

Do you wanna see heaven tonight?
Underneath those lights you will look so beautiful
Do you wanna see the stars before they fall
See the stars before they fall?
Do you wanna be my lover tonight?
And for all my life it could be so wonderful
Do you wanna see the stars before they fall
See the stars before they fall?

Maybe we should just run away
Never look back as the world decays
Say alright, alright
Nothing matters ever since the day
You pulled the pin in my heart like a hand grenade
Say alright, alright

Do you wanna see heaven tonight?
Underneath those lights you will look so beautiful
Do you wanna see the stars before they fall
See the stars before they fall?
Do you wanna be my lover tonight?
And for all my life it could be so wonderful
Do you wanna see the stars before they fall
See the stars before they fall?

(Oh)Fall out of the atmosphere
Lets run, Run until we disappear and
Never let them come and get you
Never let them take away our stars

Do you wanna see heaven tonight?
Underneath those lights you will look so beautiful
Do you wanna see the stars before they fall
See the stars before they fall?
Do you wanna be my lover tonight?
And for all my life it could be so wonderful
Do you wanna see the stars before they fall
See the stars before they fall?

Before they fall (oh)
Before they fall (oh)
Before they fall (oh)
Do you wanna see the stars before they fall? (oh)
Before they fall (oh)
Before they fall (oh)
Before they fall (oh)
Do you wanna see the stars before they fall?
