<<<<<<< HEAD
Tiptoe through the ruins of my mind
Desolation in disguise
I've been locked out of my thoughts for a long time
The rusted gates deteriorate
Do my insecurities relate?
It’s like I'm waiting to fall apart, to fall apart
Waiting to fall, waiting to fall
Waiting to fall apart

My eyes are a sight below the surface
The veil's wearing thin

I don’t fit into my skin
Maybe I'm just like the rest of them
But I refuse to take the medicine
To escape the mess I'm in
Outspoken by the voices in my head
The voices in my head

My mind is silenced by the talking heads
Chattering at me with every waking breath
My eyes are a sight below, these voices I can't put to rest
My eyes are a sight below, the veil's wearing thin
I don't fit into my skin
Maybe I'm just like the rest of them
But I refuse to take the medicine
To escape the mess I'm in
Outspoken by the voices in my head
The voices in my head

My mind is silenced by the talking heads
Drowning out reason, drowning in lament
My mind is silenced by the talking heads
Outspoken by the voices in my head
Outspoken by the voices in my head, fuck

My mind is silenced by the talking heads
Chattering with every waking breath
My mind is silenced by the talking heads
