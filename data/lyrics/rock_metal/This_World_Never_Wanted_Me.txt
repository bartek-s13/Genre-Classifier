I know the pain you feel
Too well
It’s all too real
You and I
We can't deny
We got something in common
The disregarded
The unwanted
Left to ask what we’ve done to deserve it
But now I’m at peace
It's meant to be
This world never wanted me
You never wanted me
This world wasn’t meant for me
Not part of your society
Don’t wanna fit
To feel your acceptance
It means nothing (nothing)
I’ve grown beyond your means
You know you can't stop me
This misery it set me free
Thank god this world never wanted me
You never wanted me
