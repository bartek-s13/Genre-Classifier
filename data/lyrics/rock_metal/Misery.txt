Pretty, but he don’t tell you about it
Winter scarves and skirts of velvet
Still drink just like we did in school
I passed your old house down by the cemetery
Club nights and university
When your friends sing ‘Born to Run’, baby, resist, because we were ‘Born to Drift’

If you could see the wreck I am these days, you’d have new reasons to stay away
Just hold my hand for a little while
Misery never goes out of style

I see you sometimes in dreams I have, in your bra in the room you used to rent
Do you ever wish you could wake someone else?
And so I wrote down a list of coroners, their names, their office phone numbers
To pronounce dead the thing we had
In tombs, ex-boyfriends bedrooms

If you could see the wreck I am these days, you’d have new reasons to stay away
Just hold my hand for a little while
Misery never goes out of style

I’m your chipped nail paint. I’m the fabric of your coat
You are all I fear. You are words I never wrote
You are years ago
I’m your chipped nail paint. I’m the fabric of your coat
You are all I fear. You are words I never wrote
You are years ago

If you could see the wreck I am these days, you’d have new reasons to stay away
Just hold my hand for a little while
Misery never goes out of style
