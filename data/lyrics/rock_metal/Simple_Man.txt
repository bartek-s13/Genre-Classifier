Well Mama told me when I was young
Said sit beside me, my only son
And listen closely to what I say
And if you do this, it'll help you some sunny day

Oh, take your time, don't live too fast
Troubles will come and they will pass
You'll find a woman, and you'll find love
And don't forget that there is a someone up above

And be a simple kind of man
Oh be something you love and understand
Baby be a simple kind of man
Oh, won't you do this for me son, if you can?

Forget your lust for the rich man's gold
All that you need now is in your soul
And you can do this, oh baby, if you try
All that I want from you my son is to be satisfied

And be a simple kind of man
Oh be something you love and understand
Baby be a simple kind of man
Oh, won't you do this for me son, if you can?
Oh, don't you worry, you'll find yourself
Follow your heart, and nothing else
And you can do this, oh baby, if you try
All that I want from you my son is to be satisfied

And be a simple kind of man
Oh, won't you do this for me son, if you can?
So baby be a simple, be a simple man
Oh, won't you do this for me son, if you can?
