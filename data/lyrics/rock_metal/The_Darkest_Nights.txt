For so, long I, have felt alone
Content, to live with unrest
Longing, faded, into countless, nights that buried my, weary heart
You brought an end, to this, dead hour
And meaning, to a, a calloused life
Held in Your arms, but too far from my heart
Held in Your arms, but too far from my heart

These thoughts, will carry me
Through the darkest nights
While your eyes rest in
These thoughts, will carry me
Through the darkest nights
While your eyes rest in mine!

I remember the way you looked, at me
And the way you drew, drew me close with one, deep sigh
Scattering pieces of my, my restless mind
Forgetting all, that we, have left, left, behind
We have left behind
We have, left behind
We have left behind
These thoughts, will carry me
Through the darkest nights
While your eyes rest in
These thoughts, will carry me
Through the darkest nights
While your eyes rest in
These thoughts, will carry me
Through the darkest nights
While your eyes rest in
These thoughts, will carry me
Through the darkest nights
