My sweetness
Where do you go?
When your friends tell me that you're out
When you told me you're at home
So I follow you into the ground
I'll follow you anywhere, my babe
I'll follow you round and round

Stole my last cigarette
You run me dry
I try and catch your name
You leave me wondering why
You got my heart
With just one look
As I laid my eyes on you, yeah
You read me like a book

Don't take me for a fool
'Cause I'm not a pretty fool
I may seem kind to you
But I'll rip your heart in two
(I'll rip your heart out!)
My sweetness
Where do you go?
When your friends tell me that you're out
Got me on my tip-toes
Oh, I'll follow, yeah, you into the ground
I'll follow you anywhere, my babe
I'll follow you round and round

I dance around my room
In your underwear
Oh you look at me like you
You just don't really care
I love you madly- All the time
I love you madly, yeah
I love you blind

Don't take me for a fool
I'm not your petty fool
I may seem kind to you
But I'll rip your heart in two
(Oh, no!)
My sweetness
Where do you go?
When your friends tell me that you're out
Got me on my tip-toes
Oh, I'll follow, yeah, you into the ground
I'll follow you anywhere, my babe
I'll follow you round and round

Missus Infamous (Infamous)
Oh, Missus Infamous
Oh, Missus Infamous (Infamous)
Oh, Missus Infamous
I finally figured out
What I'm singing about
About a guy that loves a girl so much
He's gonna put her in the ground
(No, really!)

My sweetness
Where do you go?
When your friends tell me that you're out
Got me on my tip-toes
Oh, I'll follow, yeah, you into the ground
I'll follow you anywhere, my babe
I'll follow you round and round
Missus Infamous (Infamous)
Oh, Missus Infamous
Oh, Missus Infamous
Oh, Missus Infamous...
