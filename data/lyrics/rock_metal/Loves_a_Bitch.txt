Oh, oh, love's got me by the ass again
I've been in love since I don't know when
I keep on runnin' and I don't know why
Love's given me a crack of lies
Out of breath and I'm out of time
Misery is a ruff fight
Love's a bitch, baby
Love's a bitch, yes, it's crazy
Love's a bitch, baby
Love's a bitch, yeah, it's crazy
Love's a bitch
Like a cat with diamond eyes
Love's power it can hypnotize
Done me in more than twice
She'll make you think that it's overnight
Your all alone in a room that's wrong
Your body shakes, your feet are cold
Love's a bitch, baby
Love's a bitch, yeah, it's crazy
Love's a bitch, baby
Love's a bitch, yes, it's crazy
Love's a bitch, whoa ooh
Ooh, yes, it is, oh, oh, oh
Such a bitch, oh
Don't you wait, don't stand still
Gotta keep on movin' or you'll pay the bill
Go by car, go by train
You gotta keep on runnin' or you'll feel the pain
Keep on runnin', keep on runnin'
Love's a bitch, baby
Love's a bitch, yes, it's crazy
Love's a bitch, bitch, bitch, baby
Love's a bitch, it's crazy
Love's a bitch, no
It's a bitch
