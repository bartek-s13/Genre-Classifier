Before us the king
As lifeless hearts sink
Before us lay dreams
A light no one sees
Hail to nothingness
You wish to die
Hail to godliness
You wish to die
Ungodliest ones
The circle is done
Ungodliest ones
Hail to nothingness
You wish to die
Hail to godliness
You wish to die
Before us the king
Our lifeless hearts sink
Before us beneath

Hail to nothingness

Ungodliest ones
Hail to nothingness
You wish to die
Hail to godliness
You wish to die
Before us the king
Our lifeless hearts sink
Before us beneath
