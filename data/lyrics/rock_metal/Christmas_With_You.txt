Made a Christmas list
Sent it off to you
I put it in the mail
I hope that it gets through
This time of year
No one should be alone
I'm not asking for that much
I just wish that you'd come home
(To me)
It seems like Christmas
Ain't what it used to be
And it don't mean a thing
If you're not here with me
What's the point in celebrating?
Ain't no happy holiday
When the only one I'm wantin'
Is a million miles away
I don't need no presents
Underneath my tree
Santa Claus, don't bring me nothin' new
And I don't need my stockin' stuffed
To have you here is more than enough
Cause all I want is Christmas with you
You're the one thing
That could make my dreams come true
I could have it all
But all I want is you
What's the point in celebrating?
Ain't no happy holiday
When the only one I'm wantin'
Is a million miles away
I don't need no presents
Underneath my tree
Santa Claus, I don't need nothin' new
And I don't need my stockin' stuffed
To have you here is more than enough
Cause all I want is Christmas with you
All I want is Christmas with you
I don't need no presents
Underneath my tree
Santa Claus, don't bring me nothin' new
And I don't need my stockin' stuffed
To have you here is more than enough
Cause all I want is Christmas
You're all that's on my wish list
All I want is Christmas with you
Christmas with you
Yeah! Christmas with you
