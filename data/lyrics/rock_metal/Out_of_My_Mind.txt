(Verse 1): 
Judge me for what I am
The passage of death
You don't play, you don't win
You change nothing
You gain nothing
Everybody's out from here on in
(Chorus 1): 
Heed my words hear me calling
Citizens watch
They're stealing our freedom
Promises left to die
(And long forgotten
The government's lost
Tantamount to treason)
Tedious the way we fall in
Avenging the cause
A rebel with a reason
For the lies
Yet war keeps callin more home
I been forsaken
For I am a patriot
(Verse 1): 
Judge me for what I am
The passage of death
You don't play, you don't win
You change nothing
You gain nothing
Everybody's out from here on in
(Verse 2): 
Need my trust
To tie the blindfold
Bled for my nation, saluted the flag
Seeds of hate
Beneath numbered tombstones
Crowding more
Pledge my religion in ruins and rags
Heed my words
Hear me calling
Bled for my nation, saluted the flag
Promises left to die
Pledge my allegiance in ruins and rags
(Chorus 2): 
Out of my mind so easily
I've left behind so many dreams
(Verse 3): 
Contrary to what I am
The passage of death
You don't play, you don't win
You change nothing
You gain nothing
Everybody's out
From here on in
(Bridge): 
Heed my words
Hear me calling
Citizens, watch
They're stealing our freedom
Promises left to die
The government's lost
Tantamount to treason
Tedious
The way that you fall in
Avenging the cause
A rebel with reason
Fall in line
Cause war keeps calling
I've been forsaken
For I am a patriot
(Outro): 
Out of my mind so easily
I've left behind so many dreams
Spiritual blindness poisons me
Not living on living on my knees
Out of my mind so easily
I've left behind so many dreams
Spiritual blindness poisons me
Not living on
Or dying on my knees
