Self raised, self made
Nothing was ever handed to me
I tasted pain, the gutter hugged me
Till I stood up and embraced the flames
Always pushing, always searching
Always crossing the line
Try to hold me back
I swing the hammer of inner strength
Always the hard way
Nothing was never handed to me
Always the hard way
You taught me truth, you gave me strength
I learned everything the hard way
Helpless and crisis
Without them you never know better days
Unsound, self bound
Cause you never had to fight for anything
