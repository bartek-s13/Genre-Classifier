Help me surrender my control
Searching for the death of my own soul
I bleed, but far beneath
My cover keeps the red from leaking
I'm bleeding on the inside
The fear before the fall
Six feet above the next time I lose it all!

Keep your silence or reach for life beyond the stars
Save your mercy for someone who needs it more
I'm the guilty, all the feelings come crashing down on me
I'm taking you with me!

Help me, I'm losing on my own
Locked up in a cage and not alone
Show me a way to keep
The hate from taking control, I'm breaking
I'm bleeding on the inside
The fear before the fall
Six feet above the next time I lose it all!

Keep your silence or reach for life beyond the stars
Save your mercy for someone who needs it more
I'm the guilty, all the feelings come crashing down on me
I'm taking you with me!

Keep your silence or reach for life beyond the stars
Save your mercy for someone who needs it more
Your the jury, all that's buried comes crashing down on me
I'm taking you with me!

I'm taking you with me...

Keep your silence or reach for life beyond the stars
Save your mercy for someone who needs it more
I'm the guilty, all the feelings come crashing down on me
I'm taking you with me!

(Keep your silence or) Taking you with me!
(Save your mercy for someone who needs it more)
I'm the guilty, all the feelings come crashing down on me
I'm taking you with me...
