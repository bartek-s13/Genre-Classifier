Don't leave the light on
I'm never coming home
Remember me when my eyes shut
I'm never coming home
This is my suicide note
For you
And you alone
Remember me when my eyes shut
I figured you should know
Not sure where, not sure when
When I die you might not even know I'm dead
Walking a fine line
Continue on? Or put a bullet through my mind?
Cry yourself to sleep
Lost in your world of enemies
Cry yourself to sleep
Lost in your world of enemies
Don't leave the light on
I'm never coming home
Remember me when my eyes shut
I'm never coming home
Always oppressing, forever a curse
Nobody better, nobody worse
Live your life full of regret
Try to forget, try to forget
I hope you're well
Go to hell
Water everywhere and not a drop to drink
You threw your rock into the ocean and it fucking sank
I can't remember the last time I took a breath
Living underwater with two hands around my neck
You burned the very bridges you always hoped to own
It's lonely at the top, I'm guessing it's lonely all alone
Product of my failures, can't pull myself together
Woke up feeling sick, it used to be perfect
Don't leave the light on
I'm never coming home
Don't leave the light on
I'm never coming home
