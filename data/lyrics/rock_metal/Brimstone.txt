<<<<<<< HEAD
Sleep with one eye open
You have no idea what I'm capable of
Keep claiming holier than thou
My knife can stab more holes than you can count
How dare you sleep where a king once slept
And dry the tears of where his queen has wept

Kill, torture, terrorize
Welcome to my mind
Terror comes in many forms
And tonight I'm terror, you're my whore
For now I'll leave you blind but still alive
So you can feel my presence stronger
This soil has cursed me
My inner demon's thirsty
You've confirmed to me the world isn't safe

My only worry in the world
Is that you can't walk on your own two feet
'Cause when you feel that last breath slip away
I won't get to see you fall down to your knees

Kill, torture, terrorize
Welcome to my mind
Kill, torture, terrorize
Kill, torture, terrorize
Kill, torture, terrorize
Welcome to my mind

Terror comes in many forms
And tonight I'm terror, you're my whore
I sold my soul so long ago
So I could watch you burn

Kill, torture, terrorize
Kill, torture, terrorize
Kill, torture, terrorize
Welcome to my mind
