All out of exits, all out of enemies
You built this prison and buried the key

I’ve given up on giving in
Temptation mocks me from a distance
But I won’t let it, win
This thin façade could never last
Like a snake that sheds its skin
Illusions shatter like glass
The sceptic inside me believes what he knows
Cynically silent but with nothing to show
The devil beside me is whispering doubt in my ear
I’ll keep pretending not to hear

So here I am for what it’s worth
I spilled my blood against the earth
Just to see the world in colour (the world in colour)

Dead; left for dead and left to rot
A tainted memory, an empty afterthought
I’d lay my whole life on the line just to see this through
If it consumes me, let the script upon my tomb read:
I found my love and let it kill me

I found my love and let it, kill, me

“Beg and plead, your own ambition brought you to your knees
Beg and plead, you built this prison, and buried the key”

A momentary lapse, the colours fade to grey...
As if the world we knew was never meant to be...
I know I’ll pay for my mistakes
Just promise me you’ll take
Take my word and take my everything

So here I am for what it’s worth
I spilled my blood against the earth
Just to see the world in colour (the world in colour)
So give me all you came here for
Give me hell and give me war
I’ll be waiting for an answer

I found my love and let it kill, me
