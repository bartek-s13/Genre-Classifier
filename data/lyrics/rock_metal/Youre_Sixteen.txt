!
You come on like a dream, peaches and cream
Lips like strawberry wine
You're sixteen, you're beautiful and you're mine
You're all ribbons and curls, ooh what a girl
Eyes that sparkle and shine
You're sixteen, you're beautiful and you're mine
You're my baby, you're my pet
We fell in love on the night we met
You touched my hand, my heart went pop
Ooh, when we kissed I could not stop
You walked out of my dreams and into my arms
Now you're my angel divine
You're sixteen, you're beautiful and you're mine
You're my baby, you're my pet
We fell in love on the night we met
You touched my hand, my heart went pop
Ooh, when we kissed I could not stop
You walked out of my dreams, and into my car
Now you're my angel divine
