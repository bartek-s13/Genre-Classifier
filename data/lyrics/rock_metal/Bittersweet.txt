I'm giving up the ghost of love
And a shadow is cast on devotion
She is the one that I adore
Queen of my silent suffocation

Break this bittersweet spell on me
Lost in the arms of destiny

Bittersweet
I won't give up
I'm possessed by her
I'm bearing a cross
She's turned into my curse

Break this bittersweet spell on me
Lost in the arms of destiny

Bittersweet, I want you
Oh, how I wanted you
And I need you
How I needed you

Break this bittersweet spell on me
Lost in the arms of destiny
Break this bittersweet spell on me
Lost in the arms of destiny
