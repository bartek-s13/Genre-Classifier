<<<<<<< HEAD
Will you remember me
As the one from the trees?
When the forests, used to sing
Or when I locked myself
In the heart of the wood
And threw away the key

You just kept, giving yourself away
A gift to cherish until, piece by piece
You laid before the roots of time
Day by day, the nights swallow the sun
And with every night
The more you gave, your sadness came undone
You just kept slipping, through the cracks
Of my fingertips

I only hope that you remember me
As the one from the trees
When the forests used to sing
Or when I locked myself
In the heart of the wood
And threw away the key

You're not desire
You're just a fucking widow
Weaving webs among the woods
I'm not the answer, but if you take my hand
I'll show you the world of the dead

There you will smiling into the night
I watched you sing, for hours on end
We're, we're telltale spiders spinning webs and singing songs
Sharing your stories with the moon and the trees
With a world which strung you along
I've shut you out
I don't like your stories, anymore
They always end so fucking sad
(Fuck! I've turned my back)
I've turned my back, on you for good
Just keep smiling, into the night

I watched you pass me by
Every night you died
With a smile on your face
In my dreams you wept blood from your eyes
Just keep smiling into the night, my beautiful bride!
Just keep smiling into the night, my beautiful bride!

I fell for your bleeding crimson eyes
(Just so you...) Just so you know!

I'll always remember, you!
As the telltale spider
When darkness crept into our days
Sharing stories with the world
Until piece by piece, you gave your heart away
You're not desire
You're just a fucking widow
Weaving webs among the woods
I'm not answer but if you take my hand
I'll show you the world of the dead
I hate sad stories they always end the same
I'll never forget how the forest wept
