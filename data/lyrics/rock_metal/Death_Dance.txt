I never thought I'd be so mean
I never thought I'd be alone at nineteen
All these thoughts are in my head again, head again
All these thoughts are running through my brain and out the door
Rather be dumb than sane, rather be numb than in pain
But you can see all the things I'm going through
Rather be dumb than sane, rather be numb than in pain
But you can see all the shit I'm going through

No no no, no no no, I hide my pain inside
No no no, no no no, I bleed to feel alive
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, I am dead inside
No, no, no, makes it hard to survive

No, you can't find my reasons, no, you can't find my pain
We all got lost in Jesus, but he can't take away my pain
I'm looking for something more
So take me away, from out the door
Now I'm looking for you outside to say, ay, ay

No no, no no no, I hide my pain inside
No no, no no no, I bleed to feel alive
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, I am dead inside
No, no, no
No, I can't take it
All of these memories
I can't fake it
I'm trying, but I am dying
I just want to
Oh, just be myself
I have tried to, but now I am someone else

No no, no no no, so please be kind
No no, no no no, I'm losing my mind
No no, no no no, I'm really not fine
Oh, I'm really not fine

We live in an age where sex and whores are Gods
We live in an age where all our bodies are flawed
We live in an age where sex and whores are Gods
We live in an age
We live in an age
We live in an age where sex and whores are Gods
We live in an age where all our bodies are flawed
We live in an age where all our bodies are flawed
Are flawed, no
No, I can't take it
All of these memories
I can't fake it
I'm trying but I am dying
I just want to
Oh, just be myself
