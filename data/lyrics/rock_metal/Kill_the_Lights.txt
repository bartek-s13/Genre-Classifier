Kill the lights and put your nightdress on
Have a last cigarette and leave one out for the morn'
Kill the lights babe, I'm too damn tired
We can't fuck tonight, I work the double tomorrow
Kill the lights and baby shoot that gun
Kill the lights and baby write this wrong

We got married and I don't remember
I just kinda surrendered
Because I didn't want the summer to end
Her daddy had some money that he could lend us
So she took me to Paris
To try and make me a renaissance man

We were young bloods, searching for something
Spent youth on the dream of love
We were too close to see it coming
Now I'm running from the things that we were dreaming of

Kill the lights and put your nightdress on
Have a last cigarette and leave one out for the morn'
Kill the lights babe, I'm too damn tired
We can't fuck tonight, I work a double tomorrow
Kill the lights and lady kill the fire
Coming undone, I'm not even here when I'm not gone
Kill the lights and baby shoot that gun
Kill the lights and baby write this wrong
We woke up when the summer had ended
Yeah the bed went cold
And everything was falling down
We spent so much of our time pretending
That we were never alone
So it goes

We were young bloods, searching for something
Spent youth on the dream of love
We were too close to see it coming
Now I'm running from the things that we were dreaming of

Kill the lights and put your nightdress on
Have a last cigarette and leave one out for the morn'
Kill the lights babe, I'm too damn tired
We can't fuck tonight, I work a double tomorrow
Kill the lights and lady kill the fire
Coming undone, I'm not even here when I'm not gone
Kill the lights and baby shoot that gun
Kill the lights and baby write this wrong

Kill the lights all night!
Kill the lights all night!
Daring, kill the lights all night!
Kill the lights all night!
Kill the lights all night!
Kill the lights all night!
Night!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Ahhhhhh!
Ahhhhhh!
Kill the lights and put your nightdress on
Have a last cigarette and leave one out for the morn'
Kill the lights babe, I'm too damn tired
We can't fuck tonight, I work a double tomorrow
