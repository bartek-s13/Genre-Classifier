The time is close now, the end is near
My walk through the valley, trails of fear
I feel empty, my penance overdue
I guess it's too late now to be with You
I'm extremely frightened of what will surely be
I sold myself, the death of me
(I know) I know You can't forgive me
(I know) I know I'm on my own
I know that I've betrayed You
I walk alone
What exactly is the meaning of this?
Just pawns in Your twisted game
Severe pain for the lie I'm living
For a love I never could betray
Question me not, say the Lord unto thee
You have chosen your own fate and your own destiny
Denied of this life is what you are to be
You have chosen your own fate and your own destiny
Lord, I pound my fists at You
Won't you just let me die?
Would I not suffer enough?
No inner peace, no afterlife
Question me not, say the Lord unto thee
You have chosen your own fate and your own destiny
Denied of this life is (denied of this life is)
What you are to be (what you are to be)
You have chosen (you have chosen)
Your own fate and your own destiny
I did what I thought was right
All for the love of my life
I know it's sad but true
Something is very wrong
Condemned to suffer so long
For a love so true
The question that lies within
So hard to understand
It still tears at me
And in my dying breath
My heart holds no regrets
I wouldn't change a thing
A spirit begins to rise
To the heavenly skies
Just to be shunned away by You
Now, all I want is to die
No streets of gold in the sky
And I wash my hands of You
Rising to the Heaven's light
Just to plead for death
Just to be denied
(2x)
I know You can't forgive me (rising to the Heaven's light)
I know I'm on my own (just to plead for death)
I know that I've betrayed You (just to be denied)
You know I walk alone
(Rising to the Heaven's light)
You know I walk alone (just to plead for death)
I walk, I walk a trail of fear (just to be denied)
(Rising to the Heaven's light)
I pound my fists at You
I'm shunned away by You (just to plead for death)
I wash my hands of You (just to be denied)
(Rising to the Heaven's light)
Why won't You let me die?
Why won't You let me die?
(Just to plead for death)
(Just to be denied)
Why won't you let me die?
