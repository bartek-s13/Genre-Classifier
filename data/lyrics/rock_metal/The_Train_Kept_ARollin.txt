<<<<<<< HEAD
I caught a train
I met a dame
She was a hepster
And a real gone dame
She was pretty
From New York City
And we trucked on down that old fair lane
With a heave and a ho
Well i just couldn't let her go
Get along, creepy little woman
Get along, well be on your way
Get along, creepy little woman
Get along, well be on your way
With a heave and a ho
Well i just couldn't let her go
Well, the train kept a-rollin all night long
The train kept a-rollin all night long
The train kept me movin' all night long
The train kept a-rollin all night long
With a heave and a ho
Well i just couldn't let her go
We made a stop
In Alberquerque
She must of thought
That I was a real gone jerk
We got off the train
At El Paso
Our lovin was so good, jack
I couldn't let her go
Get along
Well I just couldn't let her go
Get along, creepy little woman
Get along, well be on your way
Get along, creepy little woman
Get along, well be on your way
With a heave and a ho
Well I just couldn't let her go
The train kept a-rollin all night long
The train kept a-rollin all night long
The train kept her movin' all night long
The train kept a-rollin all night long
With a heave and a ho
