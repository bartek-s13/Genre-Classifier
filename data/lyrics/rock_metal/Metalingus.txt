I've been defeated and brought down
Dropped to my knees when hope ran out
The time has come to change my ways

On this day I see clearly
Everything has come to life
A bitter place and a broken dream
And we'll leave it all, leave it all behind

I'll never long for what might have been
Regret won't waste my life again
I won't look back, I'll fight to remain

On this day I see clearly
Everything has come to life
A bitter place and a broken dream
And leave it all behind
On this day, it's so real to me
Everything has come to life
Another chance to chase a dream
'Nother chance to feel
Chance to feel alive
Fear will kill me
All I could be
Lift these sorrows
Let me breathe
Could you set me free
Could you set me free

On this day I see clearly
Everything has come to life
A bitter place and a broken dream
And leave it all behind
On this day, it's so real to me
Everything has come to life
'Nother chance to chase a dream
A chance to feel
A chance to feel alive
