My reflection, dirty mirror
There's no connection to myself
I'm your lover, I'm your zero
I'm the face in your dreams of glass
So save your prayers
For when we're really gonna need 'em
Throw out your cares and fly
Wanna go for a ride?

She's the one for me
She's all I really need (oh yeah)
She's the one for me

Emptiness is loneliness
And loneliness is cleanliness
And cleanliness is godliness
And God is empty just like me

Intoxicated with the madness
I'm in love with my sadness
Bullshit fakers, enchanted kingdoms
The fashion victims chew their charcoal teeth
I never let on that I was on a sinking ship
I never let on that I was down
You blame yourself
For what you can't ignore
You blame yourself for wanting more

She's the one for me
She's all I really need
She's the one for me
