It's like a heart attack, I see the shock when you face it
We couldn't take it so we got a little wasted
I'd really love to see the look on their face
When you open your eyes, when you open your eyes
You run away, then who's gonna save us?
The only people that you find are gonna slay us
I really love to hear sound of your voice
When you're screaming their name, when you're screaming their name

Pipe down
You gotta blow it up
You gotta give it hell
You gotta pull the plug
And you could run away
Or you could kill the beast
And you could try to kill yourself
But you could never kill me

Hey, if this is how the world will end
Well you can burn it again
'Cause we will not go quietly
Hey, if this is how the world will end
Well you can tell all your friends
That we will not go quietly
(not go quietly)

So when you find yourself, you're in a place that you're scared of
You wake up to see a face you wouldn't dare love
They're gonna try to take the blood from your veins
When you open your eyes, when you open your eyes
You run away but who is gonna save us
The only people that you find will betray us
They're gonna hate to hear the sound of my voice
When we're screaming their name, when we're screaming their name

Pipe down
You gotta blow it up
You gotta give it hell
You gotta pull the plug
And you could run away
Or you could kill the beast
And you could try to kill yourself
But you could never kill me

Hey, if this is how the world will end
Well you can burn it again
'Cause we will not go quietly
Hey, if this is how the world will end
Well you can tell all your friends
That we will not go quietly
(Will not go quietly)

Oh, we will not go quietly
Yeah

Pipe down
You gotta blow it up
You gotta give it hell
You gotta pull the plug
And you could run away
Or you could kill the beast
And you could try to kill yourself
But you could never kill me

Hey, if this is how the world will end
Well you can burn it again
'Cause we will not go quietly
Hey, if this is how the world will end
Well you can tell all your friends
That we will not go quietly
Hey, if this is how the world will end
You can tell all your friends
That we will not go quietly
Hey, if this is how the world will end
You can burn it again
'Cause we will not go quietly
(Not go quietly)
