<<<<<<< HEAD
I stand alone in the darkness
The winter of my life came so fast
Memories go back to childhood
To days I still recall
Oh how happy I was then
There was no sorrow
There was no pain
Walking through the green fields
Sunshine in my eyes
I'm still there, everywhere
I'm the dust in the wind
I'm the star in the northern sky
I never stayed anywhere
I'm the wind in the trees
Would you wait for me forever?
I'm still there, everywhere
I'm the dust in the wind
I'm the star in the northern sky
I never stayed anywhere
I'm the wind in the trees
Would you wait for me forever?
Would you wait for me forever?
