Skull of Geronimo
The Skull of Geronimo
I’m not built to lose
Bred from bloodlines of those who give the blues
Born to win
It’s easy to be a player when you buy your way in
Oh boy, I can’t wait to be one of the boys!
The Skull of Geronimo
The key is a kiss once I take hold
The Skull of Geronimo
The key is a kiss once I take hold
Bit and saddle horn
Stolen from those who protect the fort
Nine days from the day they dug up the relics of a warrior’s grave
Oh boy, I can’t wait to be one of the boys!
The Skull of Geronimo
The key is a kiss once I take hold
The Skull of Geronimo
The key is a kiss once I take hold
Can’t take, take, take what you’ll never have
We’ll keep our secrets in hell
The Skull of Geronimo
The key is a kiss once I take hold
The Skull of Geronimo
The key is a kiss once I take hold
Can’t take, take, take what you’ll never have
We’ll keep our secrets in hell
Can’t take, take, take what you’ll never have
We’ll keep our secrets in hell
