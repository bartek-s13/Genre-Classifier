You got a hold on me
I can hardly breathe
Girl, you got me twisted
Girl, you got me twisted
How do you love
When everyday I'm lost and denying?
This unforgiving world
You got it spinnin' in
Tell me where to find
A little piece a little piece of my dying
Well, I keep loving you over and over
Over again
Girl, you got a hold on me
I can hardly breathe
Girl, you got me twisted
Babe, you got me twisted
Now you want more from me
But I'm too blind to see
Girl, you got me twisted
Girl, you got me twisted
We're both dying on the vine
But our love is fixated
Man, here I go loving you over again
Girl, you got a hold on me
I can hardly breathe
Girl, you got me twisted
Babe, you got me twisted
And now you want more from me
But I'm too blind to see
Girl, you got me twisted
Girl, you got me twisted
Lost in the madness
I keep holdin' on
One taste of freedom and I'm gone
Girl, you got me twisted
You got me so twisted
And you want more from me
I'm too blind to see
Girl, you got me twisted
Girl, you got me twisted
Got a hold on me
I can hardly breathe
Girl, you got me twisted
Babe, you got me twisted
And now you want more from me
But I'm too blind to see
Girl, you got me twisted
Girl, you got me twisted
Girl, you got a hold on me
I can hardly breathe
You got me twisted
Yeah, twisted
And now you want more from me
You take the life outta me
You got me twisted, yeah
