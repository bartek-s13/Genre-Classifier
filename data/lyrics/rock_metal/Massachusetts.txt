<<<<<<< HEAD
She's cutting out the bruises
Forgetting her excuses
For being here again
With a suitcase packed and waiting by the door
In her head
Convinced herself she hasn't lost enough to quit
But tonight she lays here thinking

"What if I just left
In the middle of the night
Back to California
And never looked back?"

She'll fantasize about it
Every single day
But she can't find it
In her heart to run away
And no one's listening
With Northern Massachusetts
On his knees to stay
He's begging
"Please, oh, baby, please, I can explain
It won't happen again"

He's putting out the fires
And he's making her believe
He's really changed this time
But it's obvious it's just another line
Lapse and relapse
And again she lays beside him thinking

"I'll pretend
In the middle of the night
My eyes are closed, I'm sleeping
But I won't come back"

She'll fantasize about it
Every single day
But she can't find it
In her heart to run away
And no one's listening
With Northern Massachusetts
On his knees to stay
He's begging
"Please, oh, baby, please, I can explain
It won't happen again"

It won't happen again
How long can this last?
The final straw was the hospital
At least she told herself that
But she just can't find the strength to end it

I just left
In the middle of the night
Back to California
I'll never look back

She'll fantasize about it
Every single day
But she can't find it
In her heart to run away (to run away)
And no one's listening
With Northern Massachusetts
On his knees to stay
He's begging
"Please, oh, baby, please, I can explain
It won't happen again"
