So you've found a time worth livin'
Devoured a heart worth givin'
In this long line of shells that you could be fillin'
A simple possession
A spirit obsession
Now you're crawling your way through another existence
But who paid your debt to be here?
No one
My soul is not for sale
But who paid your debt to be here?
But who paid your debt to be here?
So you've found a dime worth savin'
Misplaced a thirst worth cravin'
With this short-tempered fuse, a vice is never forgiving
A life is needed
To fill the void you're leavin'
But you will never, ever be safe from any distance
But who paid your debt to be here?
No one
My soul is not for sale
No one
My soul is not for sale
But who paid your debt to be here?
But who paid your debt to be here?
Who paid your debt to be here?
Who paid your debt to be here?
Who paid your debt to be here?
Hey you
Who paid your debt to be here?
Hey you
Who paid your debt to be here?
No, no, no, no
My soul is not for sale
No, no, no, no
My soul is not for sale
