Let me tell you all about this love and hate relation
Between a man and a woman
And so none of you all get the wrong interpretation
I can't live with them, I'm gonna die without them

Sooner or later
You'll be a he-man woman hater
It's inevitable
And to become one
You've gotta really hate to love them
He-man woman hater
(He) He-man (man) woman hater
You know I love to hate, 'cause I hate to love them

He-man's behavior doesn't need no explanation
We all got a one-track mind
He-men have always had a sexual preoccupation
It's gonna be your place or it's gonna be mine

Sooner or later
You'll be a he-man woman hater
It's inevitable, yeah yeah yeah
And to become one
You've gotta really hate to love them
He-man woman hater
(He) He-man (man) woman hater
You know I love to hate, 'cause I hate to love them

Sooner or later
You'll be a he-man woman hater
It's inevitable

And to become one

Sooner or later
You'll be a he-man woman hater
It's inevitable

And to become one
You've gotta really hate to love them
