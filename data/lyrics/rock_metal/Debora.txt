Oh Deborah, always look like a zebra
Your sunken face is like a galleon
Clawed with mysteries of the Spanish Main, oh Deborah...
Deboree-deb n' deboree-de-bree-deb

Oh Deborah, always dress like a conjuror
It's fine to see your young face hiding
'Neath the stallion that I'm riding, Debora...
(Ex tempore)
Dug a re dug ...
(Ex tempore)
Debora
Dug a re dug n dug a re dug etc
Oh Deborah, you look like a stallion
Oh Deborah, you look like a stallion
Your sunken face is like a galleon
Clawed with mysteries of the Spanish Main
Oh Deborah
