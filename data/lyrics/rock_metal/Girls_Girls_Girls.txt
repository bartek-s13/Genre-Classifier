Friday night and I need a fight
My motorcycle and a switchblade knife
Handful of grease in my hair feels right
But what I need to make me tight are those

Girls, girls, girls
Long legs and burgundy lips
Girls, girls, girls
Dancing down on Sunset Strip
Girls, girls, girls
Red lips, fingertips

Trick or treat, sweet to eat
On Halloween and New Years Eve
Yankee girls, you just can't be beat
But they're the best when they're off their feet

Girls, girls, girls
At the Dollhouse in Fort Lauderdale
Girls, girls, girls
Rocking in Atlanta at Tattletale
Girls, girls, girls
Raising hell at the Seventh Veil

Have you read the news
In the Soho Tribune?
You know she did me
Well, then she broke my heart
I'm such a good, good boy
I just need a new toy
I tell you what, girl
Dance for me, I'll keep you over-employed
Just tell me a story
You know the one I mean


Crazy Horse, Paris, France
Forgot the names, remember romance
I got the photos, a menage a trois
Must've broke those Frenchies' laws with those

Girls, girls, girls
B-B-Body Shop, Marble Arch
Girls, girls, girls
Tropicana's where I lost my heart

Girls, girls, girls
Girls, girls, girls
Girls, girls, girls
Girls, girls, girls
Girls, girls, girls


Girls, girls, girls (Whoo!)
