I am taking it a day at a time
And I don't care what the doubting voices say
I am lifting up the Name that will shine
And the light of heaven's brighter everyday

Oh, I know that it's rough
Though I know there is pain
Even so when it's tough
I will not be ashamed!

If the dawn reveals the end of days
I'll follow You till there's no more hell to pay

You have given me a gift I won't deny
And You're offering a better world to come
The sorrow of tomorrows left so far behind
With the joy of what this life will soon become

If I'm deep in the storm
If I'm caught in the rain
From the time I was born
It's You that always remained!
If the sun has fallen from the sky
And the stars that shine begin to hide
When the night has stolen everyday
I'll follow You till there's no more hell to pay!


If the sun has fallen from the sky
And the stars that shine begin to hide
When the night has stolen everyday
I'll follow You till there's no more hell to pay!
