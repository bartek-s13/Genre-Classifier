Know it sounds funny, but I just can't stand the pain
Girl, I'm leaving you tomorrow
Seems to me, girl, you know I've done all I can
You see I begged, stole, and I borrowed, yeah

Ooh, that's why I'm easy (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
I'm easy like Sunday morning, yeah (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
That's why I'm easy (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
I'm easy like Sunday morning

I wanna be high, so high
I wanna be free to know the things I do are right
I wanna be free, just me, oh baby
Ugh


Oh, ooh, that's why I'm easy (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
I'm easy like Sunday morning, yeah (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
That's why I'm easy, yeah (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
