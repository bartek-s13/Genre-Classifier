<<<<<<< HEAD
And Aubrey was her name
A not so very ordinary girl
Or name
But who's to blame
For a love that wouldn't bloom
For the hearts that never played in tune
Like a lovely melody
That everyone can sing
Take away the words that rhyme
It doesn't mean a thing
And Aubrey was her name
We tripped the light
And danced together to the moon
But where was June
No, it never came around
If it did
It never made a sound
Maybe I was absent
Or was listening too fast
Catching all the words
But then the meaning going past
But God
I miss the girl
And I'd go a thousand times
Around the world just to be
Closer to her than to me
And Aubrey was her name
I never knew her
But I loved her just the same
I loved her name
Wish that I had found the way
And the reasons that
Would make her stay
I have learned to lead
A life apart from all the rest
If I can't have
The one I want
I'll do without the best
But how I miss the girl
And I'd go a million times
Around the world
Just to say
