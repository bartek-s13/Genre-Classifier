Darlin' I know you're sleepin'
But there's something I've just got to say
Wonder if you'll hear me
While you're dreamin'
You make a lifetime
Out of every day
Thanks to you and I know, oh
Thanks to you now I know
All my dreams can come true
Blind faith in you
I got
Blind faith in you, oh yeah
Your eyes keep things well hidden
Just a hint of what
You're holdin' inside
And the first time that I met you
I consider the first day of my life
Thanks to you now I know
All my dreams can come true
Blind faith in you
I've got
Blind faith in you
And I'm not sure I deserve
A woman so true, but I love
That you think I do
I've seen the rain fall in Africa
I've touched the snow of Alaska
With you and faith, beside me
But I'm feelin' stronger every day
Blind faith in you
I got
Blind faith in you
It's true
Blind faith in you
I got
Blind faith in you
And I'm not sure I deserve
A woman so true but I love
