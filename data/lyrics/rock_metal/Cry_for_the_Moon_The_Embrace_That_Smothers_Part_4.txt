(Follow your common sense you cannot hide yourself
Behind a fairytale forever and ever
Only by revealing the whole truth can we disclose
The soul of this sick bulwark forever and ever, forever and ever)
Indoctrinated minds so very often contain sick thoughts
And commit most of the evil they preach against
Don't try to convince me with messages from God
You accuse us of sins committed by yourselves
It's easy to condemn without looking in the mirror
Behind the scenes opens reality
Eternal silence cries out for justice
Forgiveness is not for sale nor is the will to forget
(Follow your common sense you cannot hide yourself
Behind a fairytale forever and ever
Only by revealing the whole truth can we disclose
The soul of this sick bulwark forever and ever)
Virginity has been stolen at very young ages
And the extinguisher loses it's immunity
Morbid abuse of power in the garden of Eden
Where the apple gets a youthful face
Eternal silence cries out for justice
Forgiveness is not for sale nor is the will to forget
(Follow your common sense you cannot hide yourself
Behind a fairytale forever and ever
Only by revealing the whole truth can we disclose
The soul of this sick bulwark forever and ever, forever and ever)
Eternal silence cries out for justice
Forgiveness is not for sale nor is the will to forget
You can't go on hiding yourself behind
Old fashioned fairytales and keep washing your hands in innocence
