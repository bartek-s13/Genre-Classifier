Well you know I don't run with me, I know
Could tell you 'bout the nights with my alter ego
I don't like to talk about it, oh, she knows
She feels special, feeling all too close
I was born to run baby
I don't fit in, I could never be the crowd
Find that I do understand
Footloose, I am socially incapable of being your man

You're too cool, you're too cool, cool friend
So many cool friends
You're too cool, baby, I can't hang

Ain't gotta have it all at once
But then you're playing me
She talk about him all too much
Think before you speak
You're too cool, you're too cool, cool friend
So many cool friends
It's cool, it's cool, can't hang
I don't like any of it

Now he don't say much, he speaks, about her feelings
Goes along with the words, he lost her meanings
I can keep it loose, mama
Keep you at the top, never let it sink in
I can be the moon, mama
I can hold the weight, just getting settled in
A lack of vision, I can see it in you
Ooh, you lack conviction, I can feed it to you
Shut the fuck up, baby, you don't ever stop
Boy, you know you're too close
You're too cool, you're too cool, cool friend
So many cool friends
You're too cool, baby, I can't hang

Ain't gotta have it all at once
But then you're playing me
She talk about him all too much
Think before you speak
You're too cool, you're too cool, cool friend
So many cool friends
It's cool, it's cool, can't hang
I don't like any of it
It's cool, it's cool, can't hang
I don't like any of it
