Now, hey
Those are the murderous ones
Killing my people for fun
That's what they does
Living's a hazardous stunt
Born with too much melanin
We never run
Live like the Cadillacs do
Cannons and battle-axe too
Don't fuck with you
We show you how to act true
Dead white and, dead white and blue
Dead white and blue

No, you can't keep us
No, you can't keep us under your thumb
You can't keep us
No, you can't keep us under your thumb
You can't keep us
No, you can't keep us under your thumb
You can't keep us
No, you can't keep us under your thumb
You can't keep us under your thumb
No
No, you can't keep us under your thumb
Fuck, hell no
No, you can't keep us under your thumb
You can't keep us
No, you can't keep us under your
Do you feel the pain in my voice?
That's why we're murderous boys
This ain't just noise
Play with them tools like they toys
Shoot like we ain't got no choice
Search and destroy
Hop in the Cadillac ride
Howitzer hang out the side
We never hide
This why we do what we do
Dead white and blue
Dead white and, dead white and blue

Yeah, can't keep us under your thumb
I'll, I'll keep the boot of your neck my brother
No, you can't, ah, fuck whatever

No, you can't keep us
No you can't keep us under your thumb
You can't keep us
No, you can't keep us under your thumb
You can't keep us
No, you can't keep us under your thumb
You can't keep us
No, you can't keep us under your thumb
You can't keep us under your thumb
No
No, you can't keep us under your thumb
Fuck, hell no
No, you can't keep us under your thumb
You can't keep us
