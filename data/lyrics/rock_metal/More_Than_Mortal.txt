Complete the circle, watching our world fall
Restore the orders, no more than mortal
Life eternal, breaking the model
Regain your honour, no more than mortal
Complete the circle, watching our world fall
Restore the orders, no more than mortal
Life eternal, breaking the model
Regain your honour, no more than mortal
I never wanted it to be like this, i’m still locked inside my head
And now your looking at me like I’m going to save you, but really I’m the only one who’s fading
Whilst I'm staring at myself in the mirror, I’m just trying to keep my composure
And now the echos of my past are shaded, pushing me towards the point of breaking
False gods are here, they’ve turned this world to stone
Destroy the faith, our souls they’ll never own
False Idols, their souls encased
False Idols, will fall from grace
Complete the circle, watching our world fall
Restore the orders, no more than mortal
Life eternal, breaking the model
Regain your honour, no more than mortal
No more heroes, no more saviours
No more gods, just betrayers!
No more heroes, no more saviours
No more gods, just betrayers!
Fuck!
There’s no heroes, no fucking saviours
No gods, just betrayers!
False gods are here, they’ve turned this world to stone
Destroy the faith, our souls they’ll never own
False Idols, their souls encased
False Idols, will fall from grace
False gods are here, they’ve turned this world to stone
Destroy the faith, our souls they’ll never own
False Idols, their souls encased
False Idols, will fall from grace
There’s no heroes, no saviours
No gods, just betrayers!
No heroes, no saviours
No gods, just betrayers!
