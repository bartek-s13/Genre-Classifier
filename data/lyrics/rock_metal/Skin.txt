Paint yourself a picture of what you wish you looked like
Maybe then they just might feel an ounce of your pain
Come into focus, step out of the shadows
It's a losing battle, there's no need to be ashamed

Cause they don't even know you, all they see is scars
They don't see the angel living in your heart
Let them find the real you buried deep within
Let them know with all you've got that you are not your skin
Oh, oh

And when they start to judge you, show them your true colors
And do onto others as you'd have done to you
Just rise above this, kill them with your kindness
Ignorance is blindness, they're the ones that stand to lose

Cause they don't even know you, all they see is scars
They don't see the angel living in your heart
Let them find the real you buried deep within
Let them know with all you got that you are not your skin
Oh
Well, they don't even know you, all they see is scars
And they don't see the angel living in your heart
So let them find the real you buried deep within
Let them know with all you've got that you are not
You are not your skin
Oh, oh
