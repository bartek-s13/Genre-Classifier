He is finally dead
Come celebrate this day
It was slow and full of pain
Good riddance
I hope you're born again so I can have my turn
To beat you and cut you, put my curse upon you
To pass you down to my bloodline’s youth
Admit it all you want
The truth shall never set you free

Revenge is sweet but so is disease
When it turns you into a slave
Gather your friends and your family
So they can watch me spit and piss on your grave
Forgiveness is useless
It's just another form of weakness
This is for my family
Let us have this moment

He is finally dead
Come celebrate this day
It was slow and full of pain
Good riddance
I hope you're born again so I can have my turn
To beat you and cut you, put my curse upon you
To pass you down to my bloodline’s youth
Admit it all you want
The truth shall never set you free
This is for my family
And the ones who suffered with us
Let us have this moment
The years have come and gone
And we all still remain broken
Let us have this moment
He's finally dead

We all know you're going to hell
Come back to life, I'll send you myself
Dig the casket from the dirt
You don't deserve to be one with the earth

Revenge is sweet but so is disease
When it turns you into a slave
Gather your friends and your family
So they can watch me spit and piss on your grave
Forgiveness is useless
It's just another form of weakness
This is for my family
Let us have this moment
