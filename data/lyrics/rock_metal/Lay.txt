It's not over now, don't lay your flag and turn away
It's not over now, not this way
So blow a kiss and wrap me up in darkness
Make it quick before the feeling sticks and holds
I can't see no other way to conclude
So pick up you bags and we can start something new again
It's not over now, don't lay your flag and turn away
It's not over now, oohh
I heard you're takin shots from broken bottles to drown the sorrow
Left your mark and went away
I hear your brother's pain in freight trains, it sounds the same
Left your mark and went away
It's not over now
It's not over now
Please don't leave me with (with) another regret
Please don't leave me with (with) another regret
Please don't leave me with (with) another regret
Please don't leave me with, with another, with another
It's not over now
