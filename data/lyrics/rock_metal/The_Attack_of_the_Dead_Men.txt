Turmoil at the front
Wilhelm's forces on the hunt
There's a thunder in the east
It's an attack of the deceased
They've been facing poison gas
7,000 charge en masse
Turn the tide of the attack
And force the enemy to turn back

And that's when the dead men are marching again

Osowiec then and again
Attack of the dead, hundred men
Facing the lead once again
Hundred men charge again, die again
Osowiec then and again
Attack of the dead, hundred men
Facing the lead once again
Hundred men charge again, die again

Two combatants spar
Hindenburg against the Tsar
Move in 12 battalions large
Into a Russian counter-charge
They'll be fighting for their lives
As their enemy revives
Russians won't surrender, no
Striking fear into their foe

And that's when the dead men are marching again

Osowiec then and again
Attack of the dead, hundred men
Facing the lead once again
Hundred men charge again, die again
Osowiec then and again
Attack of the dead, hundred men
Facing the lead once again
Hundred men charge again, die again


And that's when the dead men are marching again

Osowiec then and again
Attack of the dead, hundred men
Facing the lead once again
Hundred men charge again, die again
Osowiec then and again
Attack of the dead, hundred men
Facing the lead once again
Hundred men charge again, die again

Osowiec then and again
(That's when the dead men are marching again and again)
Attack of the dead, hundred men
Facing the lead once again
Hundred men charge again, die again
Osowiec then and again
Attack of the dead, hundred men
(That's when the dead marched again)
Facing the lead once again
Hundred men charge again, die again
