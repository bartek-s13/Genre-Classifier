(All the way up, all the way up)

I was made to pray for the rest of the sheep
So I won't ever be following
Ain't the day thought I'd step and repeat
You're never knowing where tomorrow is

'Cause I feel like a hurricane
Like a hurricane, Lord I know
If I stay, never run away, they will never change on their own
'Cause I feel like a hurricane
Like a hurricane in my soul
There's a storm and it's gonna roll me home

Mama, all my life looked me dead in the eye
Leaving hell behind me
Heaven turn your light up
All my life I've been fighting to rise
No one's gonna stop me
Fly until I'm all the way up
All the way up
Fly until I'm all the way up
All the way up

Cobble stones with the cracks down below
You won't ever see me falling in
I don't know where the winds gonna roll
The sky above me keep on hollering

'Cause I feel like a hurricane
Like a hurricane, Lord I know
If I stay, never run away, they will never change on their own
'Cause I feel like a hurricane
Like a hurricane in my soul
There's a storm and it's gonna roll me home

Mama, all my life looked me dead in the eye
Leaving hell behind me
Heaven turn your light up
All my life I've been fighting two rise
No one gonna stop me
Fly until I'm all the way up
All the way up
Fly until I'm all the way up
All the way up


All my life looked me dead in the eye
Leaving hell behind me
Heaven turn your light up
All my life I've been fighting two rise
No one gonna stop me
Fly until I'm all the way up

Mama, all my life looked me dead in the eye
Leaving hell behind me
Heaven turn your light up
All my life I've been fighting two rise
No one gonna stop me
Fly until I'm all the way up
All the way up
Fly until I'm all the way up
All the way up
