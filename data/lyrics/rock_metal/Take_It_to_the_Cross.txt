We try to carry the weight of the world
We could just lay it all down
After we've buried the hatchet within
As we sink to drown

Make the mistake and we'll do it again
And maybe not ever to learn
One day we'll wake and the night will be seen
And we will discern it all

Take it to the cross; Take it to the cross; Take it to the cross
Take it to the cross; Take it to the cross; Take it to the cross
Take it to the cross; Take it to the cross; Take it to the cross
Take it to the cross; Take it to the cross; Take it to the cross

The flesh is so weak, but the spirit is strong
Faith could move mountains away
Why do we seek everything that is wrong
And become the prey?

We were created, yet that is debated
But Christ said it so perfectly:
"I am the way and the truth and the life and you get to
The Father through me!" "Through me!"
Take it to the cross; Take it to the cross; Take it to the cross
Take it to the cross; Take it to the cross; Take it to the cross
Take it to the cross; Take it to the cross; Take it to the cross
Take it to the cross; Take it to the cross; Take it to the cross


Take it to the cross; Take it to the cross; Take it to the cross
Take it to the cross; Take it to the cross; Take it to the cross
Take it to the cross; Take it to the cross; Take it to the cross
Take it to the cross; Take it to the cross; Take it to the cross
Take it to the cross; Take it to the cross; Take it to the cross
Take it to the cross; Take it to the cross; Take it to the cross
Take it to the cross; Take it to the cross; Take it to the cross
Take it to the cross; Take it to the cross; Take it to the cross

Take it to the cross
Take it to the cross
Take it to the cross
