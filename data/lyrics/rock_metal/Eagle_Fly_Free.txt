People are in big confusion
They don't like their constitutions
Every day, they draw conclusions
And they're still prepared for war
Some can say what's ineffective
Some make up themselves attractive
Build up things they call protective
Well, your life seems quite bizarre
In the sky a mighty eagle
Doesn't care about what's illegal
On its wings the rainbow's light
It's flying to eternity
Eagle fly free, let people see
Just make it your own way
Leave time behind, follow the sign
Together we fly someday
Hey, we think so supersonic
And we make our bombs atomic
Or the better, quite neutronic
But the poor don't see a dime
Nowadays, the air's polluted
Ancient people persecuted
That's what mankind contributed
To create a better time
In the sky a mighty eagle
Doesn't care about what's illegal
On its wings the rainbow's light
It's flying to eternity
Eagle fly free, let people see
Just make it your own way
Leave time behind, follow the sign
Together we fly someday
In the sky a mighty eagle
Doesn't care about what's illegal
On its wings the rainbow's light
It's flying to eternity
Eagle fly free, let people see
Just make it your own way
Leave time behind, follow the sign
Together we fly someday
Together we fly someday
Forever we fly
Together we fly
Forever we fly someday
