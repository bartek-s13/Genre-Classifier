Little Miss J likes to fuck
Like in a painting
Destroying fine art
Little Miss J isn't quite like
Other girls at all
Little Miss J puts her soul
Inside a letter
Destroying fine art
She is hurting herself so bad
Destroying, destroy

Picture perfect
Picture black

Little Miss J
Can I come in and play?
Cut my skin
Make me perfect
Paint me red
Another dark day
Can you help me Miss J?
Cut my skin
Make me perfect
Paint me red
Little Miss J has a certain
Taste for chaos
Destroying fine art
Little Miss J always tends
To find a way to fall
Little Miss J cannot take
The shit she's given
Destroying fine art
She is fading away so fast
Destroying, destroy

Picture perfect
Picture black

Little Miss J
Can I come in and play?
Cut my skin
Make me perfect
Paint me red
Another dark day
Can you help me Miss J?
Cut my skin
Make me perfect
Paint me red
Running out of colors
Running out of light
I run
I run
Running out of time
Running out of here
Running out of sight
Running out of fear
I run
I run as fast as I can


Little Miss J
Can I come in and play?

Cut my skin
Make me perfect
Paint me red
Little Miss J
Can I come in and play?
Cut my skin

Can you help me Miss J?
Cut my skin
Make me perfect
