Take me down, my Tennessee
I'm high and dry, don't follow me

Take me down, my Tennessee
I'm high and dry, don't follow me
Love me twice, then run from me
Well, this boy, he needs no company
This life is sharp like Pittsburgh steel
Another dart with my piss-warm ale
It may be tough, don't follow me
This boy, he needs no company
No company needed (Don't need it)
I find comfort on my own thought
I'm through with palm reading, no, no
It couldn't give me what I don't got
I don't want a lifestyle like you, not me
Well, I'm a simple kind of man with a simple kind of plan
Like to keep it lowkey
This is my time, my money
I'll spend it how I want, son
This is my drink, my lungs
I'll die when I want, son
And don't follow me
I don't see eye to eye with society
And I'm a lost boy, forever young
Don't expect an apology
She loves me still
And I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
My girl, she loves me still
She loves me still
And I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
My girl, she loves me still

She want a James Dean rebel, white shirt, blue jeans
Damn, Lana Del Rey, look what you've done to these teens
Well this is something for the fathers who don't know better
(Goodnight, Daddy)
Your girl's falling for the bad guy
It's all because she don't know better
So get the shotgun ready, y'all
This a different type of go-getter
There's something rotten in Denmark
When the punks are getting bold with her
Oh, I'm no good, I'm no good, not me, not me
Please don't follow

She loves me still
And I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
My girl, she loves me still
She loves me still
And I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
