Let's go! Oh Yeah!
Spent all of my life breaking all the rules
Stepping out of line, the streets are my school
Can't get enough, all the good time
Down and live it up, while stand alive
I'm a hell raiser, risk taker, full speed ahead
Till I'm dead in the fast lane
Live wire, wild fire
I'd rather burn up in flames
Then fade away
You gotta live it up
You gotta live it up
You gotta live it up
You gotta live it up
The devil make em and I don't give a damn
To hell with the reason, it's on stare
You got the invitation, I got the booze
Lots of vacation when there's nothing to lose
I'm a hell raiser, risk taker, full speed ahead
Till I'm dead in the fast lane
Live wire, wild fire
I'd rather burn up in flames
Then fade away
You gotta live it up
You gotta live it up
You gotta live it up
You gotta live it up
Ah yeah
Run the red light
Sleep when I die
Don't you ever tell me to stop
You gotta live it up
You gotta live it up
You gotta live it up
I'm a hell raiser, risk taker, full speed ahead
Till I'm dead in the fast lane
Live wire, wild fire
Live it up
You gotta live it up
You gotta live it up
You gotta live it up
Oh live it up
You gotta live it up
You gotta live it up
You gotta live it up
I'm a hell raiser
Run the red light
Sleep when I die
Don't you ever tell me to stop
You gotta live it up!
