Baby, I'm sorry to call you so late
Oh, I forget I can't call you that name
Still make those slips all of the time
Don't know when I'll get better
I think to the night that you handed me back
The records we shared and the life that we had
You said in that condescending tone
"I'll never forget you"

She's in your jeans, but I don't care
You were my dream, now my nightmare

At your sister's wedding I gave all that I had
Your father was cold and your mother was sad
I thought to myself they were like you and I when we last met
My love is a nail I can't pull out with pliers
The lovers I've had have been gaslighting liars
Don't know what that says about me, but I just give in
I mean it now, it's making me ill

She's in your jeans, but I don't care
You were my dream, now my nightmare
So call me when you break up as you always do
Can't promise I will pick up
I'm done with you

She's in your jeans, but I don't care
You were my dream, now my nightmare
She's in your jeans, but I don't care
