The heart went in two ways and the brain has gone in stereo
Invent and reinvest
What do we know?
(What do we know?)
Why do we do it?
Not enough to carry on alone
What's left of simple life and beauty all around?

Left in the arms of the living, I shake
Left in the cold
A cut upon the skin
They’re always sharp in the beginning
Where is the love in the bend and the break?
This is our home
A cut upon the skin
They're always sharp in the beginning

We stick to the two lanes
Live on the road
Shy away from the natural
What do we know?
(What do we know?)
It's not enough to carry on alone
(That’s why we do it together)
What's left of simple life and beauty all around?
Left in the hands of the living, I burn
But to return
A sheet upon the sphere
This simple heart is the exterior
Where is the love in the bend and the break?
This is our home
A cut upon the skin
They're always sharp in the beginning

Down in the blue
Damaged by the new
Beyond the tide
Far from all (Far from all)
But this is us
This is life
It's suicide
We're all ten feet tall rolling in that ball
This is us
This is life
Suicide

The mountain cracks from the kicks we give
The plain will split in two and swallow where we live
(Swallow where we live)
We're pushing the mistakes and the love that we take
The plain will split in two and swallow where we live
(Swallow where we live)
We're pushing down in a hole right before our eyes
The rising heat and the melting ice
Now all we care for is blood and satellites
(The mountain cracks from all the kicks)
The love we take and the grave mistakes
The land we rape that's within our wake
And all we strive for is blood and satellites
We’re going under
We’re going under
It's not worth taking the fall
Not worth losing it all
We’re going under
We're going under
We'll drop dead at the end of the fall
It's not worth losing It all
We’re going under
We're going under

Down in the blue
Damaged by the new
Beyond the tide
Far from all (Far from all)
But this is us
This is life
It's suicide
We're all ten feet tall rolling in that ball

Battered skin under the road
Life begins as I corrode (Corrode)
Battered skin under the road
Life begins as I corrode (Corrode)
Battered skin, battered skin under the road
Life begins as I corrode (Corrode)
Battered skin, battered skin under the road
Life begins as I corrode
We're going under
We're going under
We're going under
(Suck my balls)
