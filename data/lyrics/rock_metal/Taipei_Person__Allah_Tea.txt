Haha, yeah

We cast a long shadow, sucking all the cold beneath
But there's a reason, a killer is a lover with a knife in its teeth
We can settle in the dust and cave
Raise your hands if you wanna be saved
In the middle is the bottom of me
A Taipei person drinking Allah Tea, go!

We live, we die
We never wonder why
It's not too late
To fight the hand of fate

Well, you can only scream your heart out over and over for so long
Before you know it, you're gonna lose your fucking mind
So don't love, don't hate, everybody's dying, baby, I feel great
I'm running out of road but I'm still doing 75

Mellow traumatic
Ooh, looking like a Ponzi scheme
You're so sentimental
All the weight of the worlds you’ve created are weak
I am the voice of a rude generation
A middle finger for the middle-class invasion
At the bottom is the only real me
A Taipei person drinking Allah Tea, go!
We want, we need
We punish just to bleed
We know this plea
We bite the hand that feeds

Well, you can only scream your heart out over and over for so long
Before you know it, you're gonna lose your fucking mind
So don't love, don't hate, everybody's dying, baby, I feel great
I'm running out of road but I'm still doing seventy

Force the pass, divorce the castration
Another panic in a major population
Run the course, the coarseness of a bastard
We're in the eyes of a beautiful disaster
Go!

We live, we die
We never wonder why
It’s up to me
To bite the hands that feed
We want, we need
We punish just to bleed
We scream this plea
Type A personality
Well, you can only scream your heart out over and over for so long
Before you know it, you’re gonna lose your fucking mind
So don't love, don't hate
Everybody's dying, baby, I feel great
I'm running out of road but I'm still doing 75
Still doing 75
Still doing 75
Still doing 75
