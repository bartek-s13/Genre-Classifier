I donít know what you mean
I donít know what you mean
I donít
Ich weiﬂ nicht was du meinst

Sometimes I just wanna run away
Run away, run away
I only wanna disappear
Far from here
Away from everyone
Before I come undone
The time has come
The time has come

So here I go
Left, right, left
Right, left, wrong
I don't know where I'm going
But I just keep moving on
Moving on, moving on

I've been thinking about it
Too much doubting
All of these feelings
Too many reasons to run
The time has come
The time has come

So here I go
Left, right, left
Right, left, wrong
I don't know where I'm going
But I just keep moving on
Left, right, left
Right, left, wrong
I don't know where I'm going
But I just keep moving on

I put my head down, keep running away from it
Anywhere I'm going can't be worse than this
I need to get away before it pulls me in
And I'm never, ever getting close to anyone again
I put my head down keep running away from it
Anywhere I'm going can't be worse than this
I need to get away before it pulls me in
I'm never, ever getting close to anyone again
And I don't even know where I'm going to
But I don't want any motherfucking part of you
I've been waiting for this moment for way too long
I don't know where I'm going, but I just keep moving on

Left, right, left
Right, left, wrong
I don't know where I'm going
But I just keep moving on
Left, right, left
Right, left, wrong
I don't know where I'm going
But I just keep moving on
