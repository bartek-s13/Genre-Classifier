Streets crowded with voices
Thousand of faces
But you're what I want to see
Lights, reflections of yesterday
Days that have flown away
You're all I wanna keep

So if you lay here with me now
I promise the stars
They won't make a sound
If you stay
Just for a while
Cause we know the world
Won't ever slow down
If only for now, right now
If only for now

Here
The world's at our fingers
So live in the moment
I'm not gonna say goodbye


So why don't we for now forget tomorrow, tomorrow
Let me be the only thing you need
If only for now

So if you lay here with me now
I promise the stars they won't make a sound
So if you lay here with me now
I promise the stars
They won't make a sound
If you stay
Just for a while
Cause we know the world
Won't ever slow down
If only for now, right now
If only for now
If only for now, right now
If only for now
