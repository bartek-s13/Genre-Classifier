<<<<<<< HEAD
I get the same old dreams, same time every night
Fall to the ground and I wake up
So I get out of bed put on my shoes and in my head
Thoughts fly back to the break-up
These four walls are closing in
Look at the fix you've put me in

Since you been gone, since you been gone
I'm out of my head, can't take it
Could I be wrong, but since you been gone
You cast the spell so break it
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Since you been gone

So in the night, I stand, beneath the back street light
I read the words that you sent to me
I can take the afternoon, the nighttime comes around too soon
You can't know what you mean to me
Your poison letter, your telegram
Just goes to show you don't give a damn

Since you been gone, since you been gone
I'm out of my head, can't take it
Could I be wrong, but since you been gone
You cast the spell so break it
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, woh-oh-oh-oh
Since you been gone

If you will come back, baby you know
You'll never do wrong

Since you been gone, since you been gone
I'm out of my head, can't take it
Could I be wrong, but since you been gone
You cast the spell so break it
Woh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Ever since you been gone

Since you been gone, since you been gone
I'm out of my head can't take it
Since you been gone, since you been gone
