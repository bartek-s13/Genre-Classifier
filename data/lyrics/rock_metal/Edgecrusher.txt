Conceived in a hell
Beyond your depth of perception
Chaotic case of conquering domination
Psychopath snaps
Fired chains of imprisonment
A bludgeoning force
That's undermining the government

Inflict strain upon the structure
Collapsing below my pressure
Inflict strain upon the structure

The purist, non-conformist
Jaded subhuman terrorist
From flesh to steel and
Blood to blade, I fight to exist
A rival of justice
Extreme rush of hatred
Survival in a twisted world
Where nothing is sacred
