Staring out a motel window
Watching as the moon glows
Can you feel the cold?
And I can barely sleep anymore
Counting roaches on the floor
Is this really my home?
Caught my reflection in a window...
WHERE DID MY YOUTH GO?
My skin weathered by the cold
And the burden of stories that won't get told
Can you hear the thunder roll?
That's the sound of a heart grown cold
(tell me can you hear it, tell me can you hear it?)
Can you hear the thunder roll?
(tell me can you hear it, tell me can you hear it?)
That's the sound of a heart grown cold
Driving on i-5 south
Just thinking about
How it could've turned out
And I ain't never been this low
Now all I got left
Are the songs that I wrote
Caught my reflection in the window
WHERE DID MY YOUTH GO?
My skin weathered by the smoke
'Cause the only peace I know
Is the end of a Newport
Still bitter still cold
Still using mud to fill the cracks in my soul
And I know there's no hope
Can you hear the thunder roll?
