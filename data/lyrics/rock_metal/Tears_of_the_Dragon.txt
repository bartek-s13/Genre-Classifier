For too long now
There were Secrets in my Mind
For too long now
There were things I should have said

In the Darkness
I was stumbling for The Door
To find a Reason
To find The Time, The Place...The Hour

Waiting for the winter Sun
And the cold light of day
The misty ghosts of childhood fears
The pressure is building
And I can't stay away

I throw myself into the Sea
Release the wave, let it wash over me
To face the fear I once believed
The Tears of the Dragon
For You and for Me
Where I was
I had wings that couldn't fly
Where I was
I had tears I couldn't cry

My emotions
Frozen in an icy lake
I couldn't feel them
Until the ice began to break

I have no power over this
You know I'm afraid
The Walls I built are crumbling away
The water is moving, I'm slipping away

I throw myself into the Sea
Release the wave, let it wash over me
To face the Fear I once believed
The Tears of the Dragon
For You and for Me

Slowly I awake
Slowly I rise
The Walls I built are crumbling away
The water is moving, I'm slipping away

I throw myself into the Sea
Release the wave, let it wash over me
To face the Fear I once believed
The Tears of the Dragon
For You and for Me

I throw myself into the Sea
Release the wave, let it wash over me
To face the Fear I once believed
The Tears of the Dragon
