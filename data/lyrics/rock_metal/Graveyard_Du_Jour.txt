Who cares anymore
Shit to explore
I forgot my purpose in this
Graveyard du jour
Don't believe in anything
Why should I care
We're all going nuclear
And I'm goddamn sure there is no cure
TV says you don't exist
Computer hates the government
Who cares anymore
Shit to explore
I forgot my purpose in this
Graveyard du jour
Don't believe in anything
Why should I care
We're all going nuclear
And I'm goddamn sure there is no cure
TV says you don't exist
Computer hates the government
Promise me you love me
And excite my mind
Waiting for delivery
And I'm ten payments behind
Praying on my rosary
Come down dear God and talk to me
TV says you don't exist
Computer hates the government
And I think I'm going blind
Come save me king crucified
And I think I'm going blind
