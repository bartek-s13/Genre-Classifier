The good thing about you being gone
I can watch the game all day long
I can stretch my legs out in the bed
Extra pillows underneath my head

Don't why nobody told me about the upside of lonely

I got a lot more room for my stuff
And I only have to wash one cup
I can stay up late and play my guitar
And the groceries go twice as far

Don't why nobody told me about the upside of lonely

Your girlfriends ain't ringing the phone off the wall
And I never have to hear from the mother in law
I ain't cut the grass since the middle of june
I smoke a big cigar right up in my living room

Don't why nobody told me about the upside of lonely
I drop my dirty clothes on the floor
I let the trash pile up by the door
I eat pizza three times a day
I ain't worried ‘bout watching my weight

Don't why nobody told me about the upside of lonely
