Well they say that we are tragic
And they say we're born to lose
You're the misfit
I'm the sinner
You're the heathen
I'm the fool

But today you'll be the master
Or the slave it's up to you
Oh my beautiful disaster
Take me anyway you choose

Don't fight it
Ignite it
This much I’m sure

I think it's time to set this world on fire
I think it's time to push it to the edge
Burn it to the ground and trip the wire
It may never be this good again
It's like a new religion
Speak in tongues come see the light
Do not trip on inhibitions
That will only waste my time
Let me tempt you with the evils
Of the flesh and so much more
Like a Babylon redeemer
Like a pusher like a whore

Just try it
You'll like it
I’ll give you more

I think it's time to set this world on fire
I think it's time to push it to the edge
Burn it to the ground and trip the wire
It may never be this good again
It’s so dark I can't see
All the truth inside us
All I want is to feel
Something that’s real before the end

Close the door
Turn the key
Do you like
What you see?

Kill the lights
Oh come to me
Set it off tonight
Baby just like fire and gasoline
I think it's time to set this world on fire
I think it's time to push it to the edge
I'm so fucking bored so trip the wire
It may never be this good again

Just trip the wire
This world’s on fire
Just trip the wire
