1-2-3-4! The stars at night are big and bright, deep in the heart of Texas
Hell yeah! If you can't tell by the way I talk then you sure as hell better check by the way I walk
A million miles tall and wide is just beginning  to scratch the surface of our pride standing tall through it all
The lone star shines and flies alone, the only place that we call home
Everything is bigger in Texas, loaded double barrel blow you to pieces. x2
Oh! Let's do a toast for our lone star state, put 'em up shotgun heavy drinking booze all day
I'm back motherfuckers this round too pour me a fucking jagerbomb fuck that I got whiskey let's mix this shit from the east to the south
Now my friends lay me down to sleep a fifth of whiskey down by my feet if I should die before I wake tell everyone that I drank it straight
Just another night in the lone star state, next round's on me, chug-chug all the cowboys from hell drink for free
Respect walk! Respect the land that we come from
Respect walk! Respect the ground that we walk on
It's the place we call home! So walk on home boy
Everything is bigger in Texas, loaded double barrel blow you to pieces. x2
Ten steps closer to hell we stand this is our god-given promise land
The stars at night are big and bright, deep in the heart of Texas. x2
(The stars at night are big and bright, deep in the heart of Texas)
We respect the land that we come from it's the place we call home
(The stars at night are big and bright, deep in the heart of Texas)
We respect the ground that we walk on it's the place we call home!
