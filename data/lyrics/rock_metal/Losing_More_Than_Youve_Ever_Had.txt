Man, I know that you're out in the crowd
And I feel how you burn your hate in my soul
It's like I'd have my hand in your coat
And feel the stainless steel of your sword
Years have gone by, I know that she's left you
Before I passed by
I was collecting the dreams of the heart
And then she was reborn in my arms
Can't you see that you've lost her soul
She's been gone a long time ago
Man, it's been a long time since you've lost her heart
Man, you're dying
For what you've lost but never had
'Cause you've been losing
More than you have ever had
Man, stop longing
For the girl you made so sad
Always losing for so long, for so long
Man, why are you running blind to the past?
Why don't you try to understand?
When I found her she was dying
Trying to kill herself
Maybe you didn't know what you've done
But all you wanna do is wrong
Man, you came to kill for someone who's gone
Man, it's been a long time since you've lost her heart
Man, you're dying
For what you've lost but never had
'Cause you've been losing
More than you have ever had
Man, stop longing
For the girl you made so sad
Always losing for so long
Man, you're dying
For what you've lost but never had
'Cause you've been losing
More than you have ever had
Man, stop longing
For the girl you made so sad
