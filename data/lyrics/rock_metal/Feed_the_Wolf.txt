I can feel the animal within
I chain the beast and crawl inside myself
I hear the call of violence
I sleep no more and die again
I lost it all

Carry me through this world alive
I feel no more this suffering
Bury me in this cold light
I feed the wolf and shed my skin

I can see the devil closing in
I choke the breath that dies to cry for help
I feel the pull of gravity
I bleed no more and rise again
I lost it all

Carry me through this world alive
I feel no more this suffering
Bury me in this cold light
I feed the wolf and shed my skin

It's no longer a human, it's a beast, unmerciful, ferocious, fearless
You're a madman
Tampering with nature
Every man, a vicious animal

Carry me through this world alive
I feel no more this suffering
Bury me in this cold light
I feed the wolf and shed my skin
Carry me through this world alive
(Fight the animal)
I feel no more this suffering
(Fight the animal)
Bury me in this cold light
(Fight the animal)
I feed the wolf and shed my skin
