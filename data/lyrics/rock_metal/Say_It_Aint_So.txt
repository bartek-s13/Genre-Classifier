Oh yeah...
Alright...

Somebody's Heine is crowding my icebox
Somebody's cold one is giving me chills
Guess I'll just close my eyes

Oh yeah, alright...
Feels good inside...

Flip on the telly, wrestle with Jimmy
Something is bubbling behind my back
The bottle is ready to blow

Say it ain't so, your drug is a heartbreaker
Say it ain't so, my love is a life taker

I can't confront you, I never could do
That which might hurt you, so try and be cool
When I say, "this way is a water slide away from me
That takes you further every day," so be cool

Say it ain't so, your drug is a heartbreaker
Say it ain't so, my love is a life taker

Dear daddy, I write you, in spite of years of silence
You've cleaned up, found Jesus, things are good, or so I hear
This bottle of Stephen's awakens ancient feelings
Like father, stepfather, the son is drowning in the flood
Yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah!
