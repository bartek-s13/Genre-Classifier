The reasons why, oh, I can't say
I have to let you go, babe, and right away
After what you did, I can't stay on

And I'll probably feel a whole lot better
When you're gone

Baby, for a long time, you had me believe
That your love was all mine, and that's the way it would be
But I didn't know, that you were putting me on

And I'll probably feel a whole lot better
When you're gone
Oh, when you're gone

Now I've got to say that it's not like before
And I'm not gonna play your games anymore
After what you did, I can't stay on

And I'll probably feel a whole lot better
When you're gone
Oh, when you're gone
Oh, when you're gone
