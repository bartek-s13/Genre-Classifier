An El Paso hellhole I couldn't higher
White lightning moonshine tastes like fire
I drank for free till I couldn't see
I fell on the floor, what I said is
I'm blind in Texas, the lone star is hot tonight
I'm blind in Texas, the cowboys have taken my eyes
I drank Dallas whiskey and lost my mind
Had high-balls in Houston, three for a dime
Everything starts to spin, loaded on gin
I fell out the door, what I said is
I'm blind in Texas, the lone star is hot tonight
I'm blind in Texas, the cowboys have taken my eyes
San Antonio and the West Texas town El Paso
Corpus Christi and Waco, the Yellow Rose is wild
Hey dude, let's party
Raisin hell in Austin just after sundown
When the hoosegow police decided to come round-they said
"Boy what's the matter with you, what you trying to do?"
I looked at the man and I said:
Oh boy, I think I'll have another one of these
You're dreamin' buddy
What?
Time to go home
It's time to do what?
Go home!
Uh, but I don't wanna go home
Hell, home's in California
What am I supposed to do?
Get on a horse and ride all the way back to L.A.?
Yeah, don't fall off
I don't understand
We ain't got no more
What do ya mean you got no more liquor?
Split goofball!
The hell you say... suffer!
