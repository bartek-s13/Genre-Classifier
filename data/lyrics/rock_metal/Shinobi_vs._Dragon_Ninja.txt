Got it all too high
Got it figured out
Wanna do whatever
Laugh until September
And I seem to think that you are one to be with me
Maybe I was wrong
You were moving on

And I sit and wonder, falling under
Get my way or nothing will move on
Everyone has gone

You feel so empty but I've got me a friend
And I like it

And I know you say I can't care for someone
But are you that clever that you smile forever?
Is it summer yet cause I just don't feel it
Maybe it's a treaty, maybe you are not her

And I sit and wonder, falling under
Get my way or nothing will move on
Everyone has gone
You feel so empty but I've got me a friend
And I like it
Say now, got it for all of me
