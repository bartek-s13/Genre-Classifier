Mama, I been good all week long
And I think it's about time for my reward
I don't need no chocolates with cherries inside
No mama, I just wanna go out tonight
Well mama-mama, can I go out tonight
There's a real cool chick that I got my eyes-eyes on
Well now mama, she's only seventeen
Oh, but the way that girls moves mama, she's real mean
Well, now I just wanna go down town
See what the other guys are doing
I'll be home before a quarter to nine
Mama, you know well I really ain't foolin'
Mama, well please-please can I go
Lord-Lord, well I'll be home before too long
Well mama, can I go out tonight
'Cause it won't be long before the sun is going down
Well now mama, before it gets too late
Well I wanna use the car to go cruise around
Well, now I just wanna go down town
See what the other guys are doing
I'll be home before a quarter to nine
Mama, you know that I really ain't foolin'
Mama, well please-please can I go
Well mama, well I'll be home before too long
Well now I just wanna go down town
See what the other guys are doing
I'll be home before a quarter to nine
Mama, you know well I really ain't foolin'
Mama, well please-please can I go
Lord-Lord, well I'll be home before too long
Well, now I'll be home before too long
Lord-Lord, well I'll be home before too long
