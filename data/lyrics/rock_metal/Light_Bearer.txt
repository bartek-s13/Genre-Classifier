Serpent upon the cross
Faith swept into blackness
So shall there be restitution
In the slaughter of the masses

Rise, oh great deceiver
Return to the gardens alas
As it was so it shall be again
Enthroned in mirrored halls
The day of the false prophet has come to pass

There'll be a cleansing of the saints
Towards the left-hand path, desperate they crawl
All are guilty of their own demise
The burden of lies will swallow them all
Bring me the eyes of the father
Spill their wrists, recite their vows
Lay the lamb of Christ upon his altar
Slice vengeance in the neck of the sow
Demons of doctrine, creatures of the cold
Forged preachers of hate
Outdated gospel to the world of old

Serpent upon the cross
Faith swept into blackness
So shall there be restitution
In the slaughter of the masses

Scholars shield their fate
A void within the walls of sanctuaries (sanctuaries)
Fraudulent labor ripened with temptation and indulgence
For the true author of the soul to savor

As they gather in masses
Upon the hills, beyond the sands
Rejoice, the morning star rises in the east
The word of God departs from man
And as the centuries seam together
Shall we open our hearts to truth?
Man is one with the fire
In the center of the Earth
Lucifer bring us rebirth!

Lucifer!
Light-bearer!
Bring us rebirth!

Rejoice
