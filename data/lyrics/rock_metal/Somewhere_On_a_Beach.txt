Bet you think I'm sitting at home, naw
Bet you think that I'm all alone, naw
I bet you think I'm missing you and wishing you would call my phone
Hell naw
I went wheels up on a runway
And that ticket was a one-way

I'm somewhere on a beach
Sipping something strong
Got a new girl, she got it going on
We drink all day, and party all night
I'm way too gone to have you on my mind
She got a body, and she's naughty
And she got me like you ain't never got me
I'm getting sun, getting some, and I ain't slept in a week
Yeah, I'm somewhere on a beach

Heard you called my boys
Heard you called my folks
They said you drove by my house real slow
You can check any spot, roll down every road
But girl, I ain't even close
I'm somewhere on a beach
Sipping something strong
Got a new girl, she got it going on
We drink all day, and party all night
I'm way too gone to have you on my mind
She got a body, and she's naughty
And she got me like you ain't never got me
I'm getting sun, getting some, and I ain't slept in a week
Yeah, I'm somewhere on a beach

I wish it could've worked out
But I'm gettin' over you now
On a beach towel
My shades on
My drink's up and the sun's out
I'm somewhere on a beach

I'm somewhere on a beach
Sipping something strong
Got a new girl, she got it going on
We drink all day, and party all night
I'm way too gone to have you on my mind
She got a body, and she's naughty
And she got me like you ain't never got me
I'm getting sun, getting some, and I ain't slept in a week
Yeah, I'm somewhere on a beach
