There's a province up in Canada that's right next door to ours. It's called Saskatchewan. And, uh, in that province there's a small town, uh, where nothing much ever happens, called Saskatoon. This is a tune about that town. This is called "Runnin' Back To Saskatoon"
I been hangin' around gas stations
I been learnin' 'bout tires
I been talkin' to grease monkeys
I been workin' on cars

Sing another prairie tune
Sing another prairie tune
I been hangin' around libraries
I been learnin' 'bout books
I been talkin' to play writers
I been workin' on words, phrases

Sing another prairie tune
Sing another prairie tune
