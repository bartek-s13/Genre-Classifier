Hangin' out down the street
The same old thing we did last week
Not a thing to do but talk to you
Not a thing to do out in the street
Oh yeah!
Mom and dad live upstairs
The music's loud so we don't care
Nixon's gone but Rock lives on
Hell yeah
We're still rockin' in Wisconsin
We're all alright!
We're all alright!
Yeah!
Oh!
I'll steal a car and drive on down
Pick you up and we'll drive around
Not a thing to do but talk to you
Not a thing to do
Oh yeah
We're still rockin in Wisconsin
We're all alright!
We're all alright!
Yeah!
Oh yeah!
Oh yeah!
Woo-o-o-o!
