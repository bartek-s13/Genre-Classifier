Oh, nah, nah, yeah
I may have done some shit
Weathered me as a man
Couple nights, wide awake
Got some pills in my hand
When I'm thrown, leave me be
Let me lean, god damn
I'm not tough, I'm just drunk
This my scene, god damn
I'm a young adult in a cruel old world
I got fresh cut roses, all white like pearls
(He didn't give a fuck about nothin')
Need a selfish kind of girl, god damn
Need a selfish kind of girl

There's something wrong
I feel this fame is pending, oh no
With all my idols gone
Oh, I'm afraid of 27

This ain't that shit that I live for
Quick, can we get a picture, please
I ain't that dick with a booth and a bottle
Blowing up your newsfeed, oh, man
(Rock and roll, living fast, dying young
And leaving a good-looking corpse)
Hold up, slow it down
Bring it back
I got a couple cold cans in my basement
Barely ever leave my fucking basement
I've cut too many off quite too early
I make love, but I can't love back
I've cut too many off quite too early
I make love, but I can't love back
I've cut too many off quite too early

There's something wrong
I feel this fame is pending, oh no
With all my idols gone
Oh, I'm afraid of 27

Need a selfish kind of girl
Need a selfish kind of girl
Need a selfish kind of girl, god damn
Need a selfish kind of girl

Need a selfish kind of girl
(Well I ain't )
Need a selfish kind of girl
(But I got this 
But I got this )
Need a selfish kind of girl, god damn
