And I wonder even now, whatever came of you
And I wonder even now, where you are
Even though I'm much too proud to ever say it
Your ghost still comes around to haunt my heart

If only time
Could somehow turn the page
If only I
Hadn't walked away

I'm a desperate man who longs to stop the aching
I'm a desperate man who longs to find someone
Who can show me there is joy left for the taking
Who can show me there's a song left to be sung

If only time
Could somehow turn the page
If only I
Hadn't walked away

The lonely embrace of days gone by
So better the taste where love survives
But the one you loved is gone
Now I know, now I know
We can't replace what we let go
And still I hope, still I hope
That time will ease the pain
Of losing something that was pure and beautiful


And I wonder even now, whatever came of you
And I wonder even now, where you are

The lonely embrace of days gone by
So better the taste where love survives
But the one you loved is gone

La la la la la la la la la la la la
If only time could turn the page
La la la la la la la la la la la la
And take me back to yesterday
La la la la la la la la la la la la
Oh, but things would always change
La la la la la la la la la la la la
