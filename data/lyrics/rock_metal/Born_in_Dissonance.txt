We are origin
We are increate
You will see our coming for a thousand years
Every violent element incarnate
Made flesh and fused to one
You may call us remnant
As we are all that will be left
Brought forth by ancient whisper
Deployed by inverse suns
To capture the essence of creation
And render it undone
We come to make all things collide
Those joules define what we are
An energy born in dissonance
Long before first ever star
Baptized in the river you call time
We know that we are sacred
In human tongue we're apocalypse
For we bring with us obliteration
Through spectacles tuned to infinity
You will see our coming for a thousand years
You will know us then for what we truly are
