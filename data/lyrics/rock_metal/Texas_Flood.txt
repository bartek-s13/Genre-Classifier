Well it's floodin' down in Texas
All of the telephone lines are down
And I've been tryin' to call my baby
Lord, and I can't get a single sound

Well dark clouds are rollin' in
Man I'm standin' out in the rain
Yeah floodwater keep a rollin'
Man it's about to drive poor me insane


Well, I'm leavin' you baby
Lord, and I'm goin' back home to stay
Well back home there's no floods or tornados
Baby, and the sun shines every day
