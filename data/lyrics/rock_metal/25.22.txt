I'd love to love you, baby
I'd love to love you
I love to love you, baby
I'd love to love you

I never wanna let you go
And I am the reason that you let me go
I am the lover, I'm the undertow
I never wanna let you go
And I am the reason that you let me go
I am the lover, I'm the undertow
I ain't got time no more

25, a quarter to, I ain't through diggin' you yet
I'm crushing you, 22, memories live and regret
I ain't got time no more
I got all the love with no time no more
I got all the love with no time no more

Sweet teen burn, it's you that's giving me sweat
Well, my love learning all the moves and all the right steps
I ain't got time no more
I got all the love, but with no time no more
Said I got all the love with no time no more
