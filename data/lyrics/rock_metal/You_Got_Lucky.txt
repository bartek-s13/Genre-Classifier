You better watch what you say
You better watch what you do to me
Don't get carried away
Girl, if you can do better than me

Then go
Yeah, go
But remember

Good love is hard to find
Good love is hard to find
You got lucky, babe
You got lucky, babe
When I found you

You put a hand on my cheek
And then you turned your eyes away
If you don't feel complete
If I don't take you all of the way

Then go
Yeah, go
But remember
Good love is hard to find
Good love is hard to find
You got lucky, babe
You got lucky, babe
When I found you


Yeah, go
Just go
But remember

Good love is hard to find
Good love is hard to find
You got lucky, babe
You got lucky, babe
When I found you
Yeah that was it
