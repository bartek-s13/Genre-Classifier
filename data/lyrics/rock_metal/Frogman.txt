<<<<<<< HEAD
Came from the country
Last of the bare knuckle fighters
Yeah I'm an American
UDT seal diver
Your mind can't conceive
All the places I've been
To the ends of the earth
To hell and back again yeah
Never been the one to run away
Round the world with a gun in my hand
Damn right I'm a bad motherfucker
Baby, I'm a frogman
Small arms fire
And R.P.G.s
And I'd rather be fishing
In a cool mountain stream
Instead I'm dodging bullets
In this desert sand
I don't know
If I'll see my home again
Never been the one to run away
Round the world with a gun in my hand
Damn right I'm a bad mother fucker
Baby, I'm a frogman
Never been the one to run away
Round the world with a gun in my hand
Damn right I'm a bad mother fucker
Baby, I'm a frogman
From the Korengal Valley
To the seven seas
I won't die alone
I've got my brothers with me
It makes no difference
About the shit I'm in
I'm just doing my job
Baby, I'm a frogman
Baby, I'm a frogman
Baby, I'm a frogman
