Turn it up until it bangs your head
Tear it down, now mother don't play dead
People stand the noise
All the little toys
Put some more coke on the fire
Stomp your hands, clap your feet
Stomp your hands to the beat
Stomp your hands, clap your feet
Stomp your hands to the beat
Mixed up kids lookin' for that night
They're gettin' high on everything in sight
Well alright
The music's pretty loud
Someone in the crowd
Think they're gonna cause us a riot
Stomp your hands, clap your feet
Stomp your hands to the beat
Stomp your hands, clap your feet
Stomp your hands to the beat
Rock on, rock on, rock on
Stomp your hands, clap those feet, yeah
Stomp your hands to the beat
C'mon, boys
Stomp your hands, clap your feet
All night, yeah, yeah, yeah
Stomp your hands, clap your feet
Stomp your hands, clap your feet
Stomp your hands to the beat
All night long
Stomp your hands, clap your feet
Stomp your hands, clap your feet
Stomp your hands, clap your feet
Stomp your hands, clap your feet
