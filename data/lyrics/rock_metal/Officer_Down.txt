911, what’s your emergency?
Pull the trigger on this nigga, let's go

I'm screaming hands up, don't shoot
Another finger on the trigger, you're afraid of the truth
Do you look at me and tell me
So you see another fucker that was ever undercover, I don't fuck with you
Fists up, drop the cuffs
It's the price you'll never pay
A gun and a badge was a thing of the past
To protect and serve, not slay

Another case and acquittal
Another wife turned a widow
Hands up, don't shoot
Hands up, don't shoot
Another heart breaks a little
A child left in the middle
Hands up, don't shoot
Hands up, another officer down

I see the lights flash, hit the gas
No one wants to speak the truth
Do you look at me and tell me
Do you see a motherfucker that's ever been scared of you
Slammed breaks, catch a case
Another chase caught by patrol
The devil's dance does not advance more quality control
Another case and acquittal
Another wife turned a widow
Hands up, don't shoot
Hands up, don't shoot
Another heart breaks a little
A child left in the middle
Hands up, don't shoot
Hands up, another officer down

Fuck your life up
Pull that fucking trigger, let's go

Another case and acquittal
Another wife turned a widow
Hands up, don't shoot
Hands up, don't shoot
Another heart breaks a little
A child left in the middle
Hands up, don't shoot
Hands up, another officer down
Another officer
