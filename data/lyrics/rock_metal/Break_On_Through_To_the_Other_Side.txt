You know the day destroys the night
Night divides the day
Tried to run
Tried to hide

Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side, yeah

We chased our pleasures here
Dug our treasures there
But can't you still recall
The time we cried

Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side

Everybody loves my baby
Everybody loves my baby
She gets high
She gets high
She gets high
She gets high, yeah

I found an island in your arms
Country in your eyes
Arms that chain
Eyes that lie

Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Break on through oh, oh yeah

Made the scene
Week to week
Day to day
Hour to hour
The gate is strait
Deep and wide

Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Break on through
Break on through
Break on through
Break on through
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
