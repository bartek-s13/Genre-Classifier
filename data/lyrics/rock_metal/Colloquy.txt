Old man is walking down memory lane
His piercing stare tears out through the rain
You can see in his eyes
Ain't too much life
Left in them veins
He tells his son
"I'll be out on the run
If I ever get out of this 
And if you don't mind
I'll be out of my mind
Thanks for the time you could spare"

'Cause I know you're leavin'
Don't leave me 
Your smile is misleadin'
Your eyes are 
'Cause I can't hold on
'Cause I can't move on

Young man is walkin' down  Avenue
Can't understand what he's fixin' to lose
You can see through his tears
A moment of fear
Comes creepin' through
He tells his father
Wouldn't even bother
Could ever get over you
And if you don"t mind
I'll make up for lost time
I swear on my life this is true

'Cause I know you're leavin'
Don't leave me 
Your smile is misleadin'
Your eyes are 
'Cause I can't hold on
'Cause I can't move on

I know you're leavin'
Don't leave me 
Your smile is misleadin'
Your eyes are 
'Cause I can't hold on
I can't move on
