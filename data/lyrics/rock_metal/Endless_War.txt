You're fighting an endless war
Hunting a miracle
And when you reach out for the stars
They just cut you down

Looking through the glass, cannot recognise the ghost that you are seeing
Every step you take on the burning sand slowly sinking deeper
All the memories remain, all the pain from your broken home (Oh)
And the walls ’round your heart grew so strong, you can't let go

You keep crawling on
Don't wanna let it go
So you keep holding on
To feel whole

’Cause you're fighting an endless war
Hunting a miracle
And when you reach out for the stars
They just cut you down
'Cause you're fighting an endless war
Hunting a miracle
Is it worth dying for?
Or are you blinded by, blinded by it all?

Here they come again, hear them whispering when your heart is bleeding
Like a symphony playing on repeat, unraveling your feelings
All the memories remain, all the strain, you feel broken up
And the weight that you feel pulls you down, you can't let go

You keep crawling on
Don't wanna let it go
So you keep holding on
To feel whole

'Cause you're fighting an endless war
Hunting a miracle
And when you reach out for the stars
They just cut you down
’Cause you’re fighting an endless war
Hunting a miracle
Is it worth dying for?
Or are you blinded by, blinded by it all?

It's an endless war
But then they cut you down, they cut you down once more
(System overload
Self-destruct sequence activated
One minute until self-destruction)
Don’t let them cut you down, cut you down once more
