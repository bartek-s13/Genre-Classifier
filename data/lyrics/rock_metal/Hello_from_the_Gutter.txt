All those dreams and broken glass
Swept down the sewer
With the rest of the trash
Never to be seen again
Now, you're making a home
In a garbage can
Here's a little story that I live to tell
Hello from the gutter
Hello from our little Hell
Wasted days, wasted nights
Hypnotised by the city lights
Another king and another queen
Living in the shadows
So they can't be seen
Remember all the world
Lies at your feet
And the big apple's rotten
Rotten in the heat
Hello, hello
Hello from the gutter
Hello, hello
Hello from the gutter
Hello, hello
Hello from the gutter
Hello, hello
Hello from the gutter
Gutter child, sweet sixteen
Broadway stars that have never been
All those dreams and broken glass
Swept down the sewer
With the rest of the trash
Here's a little story that we live to tell
Hello from the gutter
Hello from our little Hell
Hello from the gutter
Hello from the gutter
Hello from the gutter
Hello from the gutter
Hello from the gutter
Hello from the gutter
Welcome to the gutter
