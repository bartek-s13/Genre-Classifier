Spiraling, down the void is pulling me
Twisting me
Willingly, I'll abandon all I knew

Circling
When I'm finally down the drain, I will see it differently
Sadly that's the best I can do

I think I've fallen apart
Left only an empty dial tone
I'm going back to the start
Vortex completes the cycle

It spat me down and out decrepit and weak
A crippled mess as I was destined to be
A shattered man for everybody to see
Can't figure how to put this delicately so
.. ... .... .. 
What, what?
So here we go
Vortex completes the cycle

Circling
When I'm finally down the drain, I will see it differently
Sadly that's the best I can do

I think I've fallen apart
Left only an empty dial tone
I'm going back to the start
Vortex completes the cycle

Down where the darkness reigns
Onto the deepest void
Bone marrow heaves the weight, of the unconscious, world!
And we will find our place, amongst the stains of old
Our ancient ways reclaimed, hidden beneath the fold

It spat me down and out decrepit and weak
A crippled mess as I was destined to be
A shattered man for everybody to see
Can't figure how to put this delicately so
.. ... .... .. 
What, what?
So here we go
Vortex completes the cycle
