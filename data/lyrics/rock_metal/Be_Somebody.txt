I’m just the boy inside the man
Not exactly who you think I am
Trying to trace my steps back here again so many times
I’m just a speck inside your hand
You came and made me who I am
I remember where it all began so clearly

I feel a million miles away
Still you connect me in your way
And you create in me
Something I would’ve never seen
When I could only see the floor
You made my window a door
So when they say they don’t believe
I hope that they see you in me
After all the lights go down
I’m just the words you are the sound
A strange type of chemistry
How you’ve become a part of me
And when I sit alone at night
Your thoughts burn through me like a fire
You’re the only one who knows who I really am

We all wanna be somebody
We just need a taste of who we are
We all wanna be somebody
We’re willing to go but not that far

And we’re all see through, just like glass
And we can shatter just as fast
That light’s been burned out for a while
I still see it every time I pass
It was lost in the corners of my mind
Behind a box of reasons why
I never doubted it was there
It just took a little time to find and even when

I feel a million miles away
Still you connect me in your way
And you create in me something
I would’ve never seen
When I could only see the floor
You made my window a door
So when they say they don’t believe
I hope that they see you in me
After all the lights go down
I’m just the words you are the sound
A strange type of chemistry
How you’ve become a part of me
And when I sit alone at night
Your thoughts burn through me like a fire
You’re the only one who knows who I really am

We all wanna be somebody
We just need a taste of who we are
We all wanna be somebody
We’re willing to go but not that far
We all wanna be somebody
We just need a taste of who we are
We all wanna be somebody
We’re willing to go but not that far

I’m just the boy inside the man
Not exactly who you think I am
Trying to trace my steps back here again so many times
When I could only see the floor
You made my window a door
So when they say they don’t believe
