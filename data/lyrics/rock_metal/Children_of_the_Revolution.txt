Well you can bump and grind
It is good for your mind
Well you can twist and shout
Let it all hang out

Well you can Terraplane
In the falling rain
I drive a Rolls-Royce
Cause it's good for my voice

But you won't fool the children of the revolution
No, you won't fool the children of the revolution
No, no, no
Yeah

But you won't fool the children of the revolution
No, you won't fool the children of the revolution
No, you won't fool the children of the revolution
No, you won't fool the children of the revolution
