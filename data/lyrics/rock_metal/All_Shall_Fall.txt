Storming the borders of chaos
For the cause of a battle once strong
Faster than the wind we rode
To where our blackened hordes dawned
Armed in the fires of combat
The end will come fast on this day
Stronger than the gods we fought
Triumphant for the dark prophecies
Besiege the thrones of reverence
Gods of all fiery fate
Besiege the thrones of reverence
Warriors crowned this day
All Shall Fall
Storm forth through battle of fury
All giant warrior be
Blacker than the winds of death
Stronghold and fear blind the weak
Brought at the borders of chaos
For the cause of a battle once strong
Faster than the wind we rode
To where our blackened hordes dawned
Besiege the thrones of reverence
Gods of all fiery fate
Besiege the thrones of reverence
