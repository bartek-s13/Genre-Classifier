Risk my soul, test my life
For my bread
Spend my time, lost in space
Am I dead?
Let the river flow
Through my callused hands
And take me from my own
The eyes of the damned
It makes my stomach turn
And it tears my flesh from the bone
How we turn a dream to stone
And we all die young
Tell me I know
I lived so afraid
And still we cry alone
With words left unsaid
Yeah, it makes my stomach turn
And it tears my flesh from bone to bone
How we turn our dream to stone
And we all die young
Yeah, we all die young
Young
Young
Young
Young
Yeah, we all die young
Yeah, we all die young
Yeah, we all die young
Yeah, we all die
