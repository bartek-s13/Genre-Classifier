Inside of me there is a lonely place
Sometimes I just don't know it's there
But when I'm all alone
That's when I have to face

The part of me that needs someone
To be by my side
That's when I call on . . 

You, You make my life complete
You give me all I need
You help me through and through
I'm calling on you

I can't explain just what You do to me
My love grows stronger everyday
You give me love
You give me company

And when I have to face the rain
You bring sunshine
Into my life

You, You make my life complete
You give me all I need
You help me through and through
I'm calling on you


You, You make my life complete
You help me through and through
You give me all I need
You, You make my life complete
You help me through and through
Calling on you
Calling on you

Calling on you
Calling on you
Calling on you now
Calling on you
Calling on you
Calling on you now
Calling on you
Calling on you
Calling on you now
Calling on you
