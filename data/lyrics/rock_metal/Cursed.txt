What you know about
Opening the oven so the house gets warm?
Forever cursing the day you were born
Forever alone, where do I begin?
&amp; I ain't never met a demon that didn't want in

So can you picture me rolling
Playing "picture me rolling"?
95-South and I don't know where I'm going
I just wanna be free
So can you picture me rolling?
Laid back and I'm smokin
Left it all behind
And then I just kept going
I just wanna be free
Yeah and I talk about pain
Cause I know pain
They tell me expand, but man
I stay in my lane
And y'all try and talk hard
But you ain't been in no gang
And I been stabbed 5 times
That's why I stay on my aim
Where were you
When I was slumped over?
When I was hunched over
Pulling glass out my shoulder?
Where were you?
Still avoiding the truth
You just a pussy with a tool
Man I know about you
I am the pain
I'm the wind and the rain
I'm the bloodshot eyes
And the weathered face
I'm the cross to bear
In this world of shit
...And we ain't gotta live like this
