She said since we've been together
I tried not to keep secrets
I was so lost then
I don't like to talk about it
See, I needed money
Cause the habit wasn't cheap
I gave them my body
Now my memory won't let me sleep
Now I lay beside you
And when you touch me
I feel like I don't deserve you
That's when you remind me
She says how could you love me
When you know where I've been
How could you love me
When you know where I've been
How could you love me
When you know where I've been
You said when I came home
I tried to put myself back together
The war's still going on
And all my brothers are still in danger
Now I am a soldier
And the tradition runs deep
I gave them my body
Now my memory won't let me sleep
Now I lay beside you
And when you touch me
I feel I don't deserve you
That's when you remind me
I say how could you love me
When you know where I've been
How could you love me
When you know where I've been
How could you love me
When you know where I've been
How could you love me
When you know where I've been
How could you love me
When you know where I've been
How could you love me
When you know where I've been
How could you love me
When you know where I've been
