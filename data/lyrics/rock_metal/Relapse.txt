<<<<<<< HEAD
I could sit and watch in silence
As the space grows in between
Returns me to a grim serenity
But every breath I breathe I crave it
The solemn slow surrender
The bitter pill to medicate me, sedate me

But the days are getting longer
I can feel it slip away
(Feel it slip away)
The poison in my head's become the poison in my veins
Wake me when it's over, I'm dying to believe
(Dying to believe)
I've never felt as lonely as I do when you're here with me

The vultures hover: persistent disease
Nine circles deep, we try to sleep
Eyes opened wide in disbelief
I'm nothing more than a sedentary waste of space and air
A disappointment to myself, to you and everybody else
Too strung out to ever face
How I long to fucking leave this place
I know you'll be there beside me
If I could tear down the walls between us
Tear down the walls between us
There could be something here to hold
Something that's worth salvaging, that I could not let go
I know, this chemical delay
Can't be the only thing that brings me clarity
But the days are getting longer
I can feel it slip away
(Feel it slip away)
The poison in my head's become the poison in my veins
Wake me when it's over, I'm dying to believe
(Dying to believe)
I've never felt as lonely as I do when you're here with me

Would you still be there beside me?
If I could tear down the walls between us
