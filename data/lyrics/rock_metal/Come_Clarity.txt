Rushing through thirty
Getting older every day
By two, drawing pictures
Of innocent times
Can you add colour
Inside these lines?

I want you to lead me
Take me somewhere
Don’t want to live in a dream one more day
I want you to lead me
Take me somewhere
Don’t want to live in a dream one more day

Sure, if we change our perspective
I'm certain I would change today
I'm certain it would change our ways
Would things fall into place?

I want you to lead me
Take me somewhere
Don’t want to live in a dream one more day
I want you to lead me
Take me somewhere
Don’t want to live in a dream one more day


I want you to lead me
Take me somewhere
Don’t want to live in a dream one more day
I want you to lead me
Take me somewhere
Don’t want to live in a dream one more day

Take me somewhere
Don’t want to live in a dream one more day
Take me somewhere
