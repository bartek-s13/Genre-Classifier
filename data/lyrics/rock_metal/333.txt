My goddamn life's been torn to pieces
Been stolen, been cheated, been broken, been beaten
Shadows in the belly of death come creeping
With arms outstretched, just come and take me
Fuck it all, fuck off, fuck life, I’m leaving

Life is like a razor slowly dragging down my wrist
Holding tight to my existence, clenched up like a fist
I've let my past control me and destroy me, I'm unraveled
Heart beating like a hammer, shaping iron on an anvil
My head screams, my ears bleed, I’m trapped inside a riot
My mind held in captivity from the mutiny of the pirates
I'm shaking like a rattle can in the hand of a vandal
I'm burning like the fuse on a bomb you can't dismantle

My goddamn life's been torn to pieces
Been stolen, been cheated, been broken, been beaten
Shadows in the belly of death come creeping
With arms outstretched, just come and take me
Fuck it all, fuck off, fuck life, I'm leaving

Time is like a noose slowly slipping around my neck
All humanity has done for me is show me disrespect
Frenetic confrontation is the road I gotta travel
Fuck complacency, conformity, I don't lay down, I battle
Come with reckless abandon full of reckless intent
Without a care, without restraint, and now I'm fucking bent
Malevolent and violent to the marrow in my bones
If you’re not helping me, you’re hurting me, and pain is what you're owed

My goddamn life’s been torn to pieces
Been stolen, been cheated, been broken, been beaten
Shadows in the belly of death come creeping
With arms outstretched, just come and take me
Fuck it all, fuck off, fuck life, I'm leaving
