Pass through the light and into the dark
Alive in the wake of our collapse
Polluted eyes, chemical hearts
We found a way to make money in the dark
Leaders of all, oh how we've evolved
Make a fist
Give us the strength that we need to resist
Cast down, let chaos
Consume us now
We fight to break free, free from these chains on our liberty
A wolf in disguise, to prey on our fear
They found a way to make our fortune disappear
Leaders of all, oh how we've evolved
Where are you now in our state of revolt
Give us the strength that we need to resist
Cast down, let chaos
Consume us now
Make a fist
Give us the strength that we need to resist
Cast down, let chaos
Consume us now
It's time to turn our heads, open our eyes, and follow our hearts
From inside ourselves (inside ouselves) is where it must start
Breaking waves of progress on the backs of the weak
A face for the faithless armed with the answers we seek
Pray for the end, a shameless parade
Watch as the structure collapses
Misery ends as the structure collapses
Indoctrination wearing thin
Back to the wall, fall to the floor
Misery ends as the structure collapses
Cast down, let chaos
Consume us now
