Every mistake I've made
Every bridge I burned
All the love that I killed
You know I never learned
So many friendships deaded
Wasted fucking time
I'll look you straight in the eye
And you know I lied
Hard lessons, I've had my share
Can't learn from mistakes when I don't f*cking care
I've burnt bridges, I lit the flame
That killed friendships and I still felt nothing
Hard lessons
I had it coming
I bit the hand that feeds
I'm gonna burn myself down
And take you with me
Can't trust no woman
Can't trust the lies they tell me
I don't need acceptance
I belong to nothing
Hard lessons, I've had my share
Can't learn from mistakes when I don't fucking care
I've burnt bridges, I lit the flame
That killed friendships and I still felt nothing
Hard lessons
What's done is done and I'll turn on you again
What's done is done and I'll turn on you again
Hard lessons don't come cheap
What would kill you can't touch me
Hard lessons don't come cheap
Hard lessons don't come cheap
