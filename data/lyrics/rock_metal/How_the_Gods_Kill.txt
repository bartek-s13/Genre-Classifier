If you feel alive in a darkened room
Do you know the name of your solitude?
If you ain't got the answer, if you don't know the truth
If you want the power, then let it flow through
Would you let it go?
Oh, would you let it go?
Oh, would you let it go?
Oh, would you let it go?
They cannot end this mourning of my life
Show me how the gods kill
Yeah
If you feel alive
If you've got no fear
Do you know the name
Of the one you seek?
If you want the answer
If you want the truth
Look inside your empty soul
There you'll find the noose
Would you let it go?
Oh, would you let it go?
Oh, would you let it go?
Oh, would you let it go?
They cannot end this mourning of my life
Show me how the gods kill
Pray
Woah, yeah
