Hordes of faces, empty eyes - I see nothing new
Seasoned schemes of slimy curs
Offer up their flu

Am I beast or, am I human? Am I just like you?
Power seething, really reeling
Reaching out for you...
Am I demon? You need to know!

Faces of a million Hells, rage inside these veins
Pounding out deserved pain to anyone in need

Every world and every limb, torn asunder base
Everything I need is me - Everything I am
Every world and every limb, torn asunder base
Everything I need is me - Everything I am
Every world and every limb, torn asunder base
Everything I need is me - Everything I am
Every world and every limb, torn asunder base
Everything I need is me - Everything I am

Am I beast or, am I human? Am I just like you?
Power seething, really reeling
Reaching out for you...
Am I demon? You need to know!
