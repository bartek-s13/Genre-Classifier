<<<<<<< HEAD
Driving faster in my car
Falling farther from just what we are
Smoke a cigarette and lie some more
These conversations kill
Falling faster in my car

Time to take her home
Her dizzy head is conscience laden
Time to take a ride
It leaves today no conversation
Time to take her home
Her dizzy head is conscience laden
Time to wait too long
To wait too long, to wait too long

Too much walking, shoes worn thin
Too much tripping and my soul's worn thin
Time to catch a ride it leaves today
Her name is what it means
Too much walking, shoes worn thin

Time to take her home
Her dizzy head is conscience laden
Time to take a ride
It leaves today no conversation
Time to take her home
Her dizzy head is conscience laden
Time to wait too long
To wait too long
To wait too long
Conversations kill

Time to take her home
Her dizzy head is conscience laden
Time to take a ride
It leaves today no conversation
Time to take her home
Her dizzy head is conscience laden
Time to wait too long
To wait too long
To wait too long
