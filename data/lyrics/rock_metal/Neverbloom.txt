A single, tear from the elms, of emptiness falls to stain the, cracked earth
(And the) soil breathes, one final desperate breathe of life
Tiny, budding flowers and colors of joy
And hope, explode from the water-bead
Undying, undimming
Before, shattering to dust
Before, shattering, to dust! (dust)
These woods have no memory
Of the touch of sun, or the smell of dew
And all I can hear through the, deafening silence, are the moaning trees

It was Morrow who cursed this place
Now cheerless and stagnant it screams (screams)
In the night so we hearken the cries, from the heart of the wood
I linger, on in doubt, darkness comes early down here
Wishing upon ages (ages) these flowers will someday bloom

I'd wait here forever (forever)
Just to see, just to see these flowers bloom
They never bloom

You fucking betrayed us
In these woodlands we wove
Dreaming amidst the groves
Morrow, no one could stop us
Although, now the orchards, no longer grow
So I'll reclaim the throne of woe
I'm starting to count the stars by myself
And this winter is eating away at my soul
I'll always remember the day, I was, stabbed in the back
I'll always remember the day, I was, stabbed in the (back)
In the back!

Just like teardrops
The limbs of the, dying!
Trees, began to fall!
One by one
Just like teardrops
The limbs of the, dying!
Trees, began to fall!
Now let me sleep!
Let me sleep
In this garden, that never blooms

A single, tear from the elms, of emptiness falls to stain the, cracked earth
(And the) soil breathes, one final desperate breathe of life
Tiny, budding flowers and colors of joy
And hope, explode from the water-bead
Undying, undimming
Before, shattering to dust
Before, shattering, to dust! (dust)
These woods have no memory
Of the touch of sun, or the smell of dew
And all I can hear through the, deafening silence, are the moaning trees

And so here I will wait for the spring, in the garden of tears
If you listen in the night, you hearken the cries from the heart of the wood
And so here, I will wait, until my last dying days
Wishing upon ages (ages)
These flowers will someday bloom

I'd wait here forever (forever)
Just to see, just to see these flowers bloom
They never bloom!

I'd wait here forever
Just to see these flowers bloom
