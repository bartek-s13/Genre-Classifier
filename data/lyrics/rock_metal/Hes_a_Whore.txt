Have you seen her face
She's got a face that could stop a clock
And with that face I surely won't stop
To look her in the eyes

But her money's green
Like tea and so is her teeth
But she's still so close to my reach
If I call, if I call at all

Any time at all
Any time at all
Any time at all
Any time at all

So the story goes
I think I'll take her for a ride
With this moneybag by my side
A gigolo is the only way to go

And so I show my face
And I can't even fake a smile
But I'm laughing inside all the while
This little girl, she's a joke, she's a joke, she's a joke

Any time at all
Any time at all
Any time at all
Any time at all

He's a whore
(I'd do anything for money)
He's a whore
(Look at the things that I write)
He's a whore
(Ooh, the stories I can tell)
He's a whore
(And my body really smells)
I'm a whore
(He'll do anything for money)
I'm a whore
(Look at the clothes that he wears)
I'm a whore
(He'll do anything for money)
I'm a whore

Ans so the story goes
I think I'll take her for a ride
With this moneybag by my side
A gigolo is the only way to go

Oh
Whoa
Oh oh
Oh
Oh oh oh oh oh-oh
Oh
