<<<<<<< HEAD
I am skin and bones, broken stones
See the scars that I show
I live outside the bounds
In the unknown
I can't ingratiate to the hate
'Cause their world suffocates
Carve my own path and form my destiny’s shape
This storm won’t wait

The rain is falling down upon me

Beyond the pale
I found salvation
Emancipation
Beyond the pale
I found my heroes
The freaks and zeroes

I live outside the lines, got no time
For the willfully blind
I'll build a world of mine
Sever the ties
I'll break down every wall
Fight and claw
Take their punches, stand tall
My middle finger raised, so fuck 'em all
And let them crawl

The rain is falling down upon me

Beyond the pale
I found salvation
Emancipation
Beyond the pale
I found my heroes
The freaks and zeroes
(Inaudible whispering)


Weather the storm
My heart is drowning
The rain is falling down upon me
Beyond the pale
I found salvation
Emancipation
Beyond the pale
I found my heroes
The freaks and zeroes

Beyond the pale
Beyond the pale
Beyond the pale
