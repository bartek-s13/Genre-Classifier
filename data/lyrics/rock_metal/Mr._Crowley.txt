<<<<<<< HEAD
Mr. Crowley, what went wrong in your head?
Oh, Mr. Crowley, did you talk to the dead?

Your life style to me seemed so tragic
With the thrill of it all
You fooled all the people with magic
You waited on Satan's call

Mr. Charming, did you think you were pure
Mr. Alarming, in nocturnal rapport

Uncovering things that were sacred
Manifest on this Earth
Conceived in the eye of a secret
And they scattered the afterbirth


Mr. Crowley, won't you ride my white horse?
Mr. Crowley, it's symbolic of course
Approaching a time that is classic
I hear that maiden's call
Approaching a time that is drastic
Standing with their backs to the wall

Was it polemically sent?
I wanna know what you meant
