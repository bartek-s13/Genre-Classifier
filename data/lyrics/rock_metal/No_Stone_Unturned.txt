I made it up to Nashville, played the part
I took a broken guitar through the heart
And I chased a girl to New Orleans
She lit me up on Bourbon Street

So I headed up to Memphis on a train
Got sidetracked in the Mississippi rain
Picked up a case of delta blues
Then I washed it down with Tennessee booze

Well, there ain't no grass gonna grow up under my feet
No tellin' where I might be
I can always find one hell of a time
While I'm out here lookin' for me
No stone unturned, no turn unstoned

Well, Colorado put me in the clouds
I still don't think my feet have touched the ground
And I sat the night on fire out in L.A
Hell, I'm just glad nobody knew my name

Well, there ain't no grass gonna grow up under my feet
No tellin' where I might be
I can always find one hell of a time
While I'm out here lookin' for me
No stone unturned, no turn unstoned
I'm drawn to the chaos and the wind
Can't help but take a look around the bend
And one day I'll prob'ly settle down
But there's still a lotta lost to be found

Well, there ain't no grass gonna grow up under my feet
No tellin' where I might be
I can always find one hell of a time
While I'm out here lookin' for me
No stone unturned, no turn unstoned
No stone unturned, no turn unstoned
