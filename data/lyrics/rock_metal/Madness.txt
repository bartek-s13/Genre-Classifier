History repeats itself
Over and over, again and again
Why should we escape ourselves
We are who we are in the end
In the end

Over and over again
Over and over again

This is madness, madness
You know that
This is madness, madness
You know that
This is never-changing
It's always been this way
Consuming madness, madness

Enemies who once were friends
Round and around till we know how it ends
I can't believe how sickening
All the love lost we can't even pretend
Over and over again
Over and over again

This is madness, madness
You know that
This is madness, madness
You know that
This is never-changing
It's always been this way
Consuming madness, madness

This is madness, madness
You know that
This is madness, madness
You know that
This is never-changing
It's always been this way
