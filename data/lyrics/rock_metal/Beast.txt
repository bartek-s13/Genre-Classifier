Whatever is necessary to do, you do it!
When somebody needs to be killed, there's no wrong. You do it!
Then you move on; you will pick up a child and you move into the desert, you pick up as many children as you can - and you kill whoever gets in your way
This is us...

We all come from broken homes
Broken hearts and broken bones
We will live and die alone
Welcome to the edge
Tonight we will descend
We might not be enemies
But we can not be friends

I wanna go on record to say
That I wanna live to see the day
When the world screams gasping for air
Cries unanswered 'cause nobody cares (nobody cares)
I want to breathe my final breath
Knowing you died, a painful death
The fucking world is an ugly place
But I will die with a smile on my face

My life is a shooting range
People never change
My life is a shooting range
People never change
We all come from broken homes
Broken hearts and broken bones
We will live and die alone
We will live and die alone
Welcome to the edge
Tonight we will descend
We might not be enemies
But we cannot be friends

My life is a shooting range
People never change
My life is a shooting range
People never change
My life is a shooting range
People never change
My life is a shooting range
People never change
