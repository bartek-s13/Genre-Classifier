Something I just might regret
Something you will not forget
Maybe I should throw away
Everything I've learned today
All over me - All over me
All over me - All over me
All over me - All over me
All over me - All over me
Pushing forward from the truth
Maybe it's me and maybe it's you
Sometimes I don't know myself
28 years straight to Hell!
All over me - All over me
All over me - All over me
All over me - All over me
All over me - All over me
There's something changing in me
There's something growing in me
There's something changing in me
There's something growing inside of me
-(Go away - Don't change)-
-(Go away - Don't change)-
Go away, don't want this
Go away, don't want this
Go away, don't want this
Go away, don't want this
Go away, don't want this
Go away, don't want this
Go away, don't want this... Don't want this!
All over me - All over me
All over me - All over me
All over me - All over me
All over me - All over me
There's something changing in me
There's something growing in me
There's something changing in me
There's something growing, now!
All over me - All over me
All over me - All over me
All over me - All over me
All over me - All over me
