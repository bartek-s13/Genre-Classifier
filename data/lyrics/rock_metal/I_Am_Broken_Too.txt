You carry this weight
Trying to cover your mistakes
To make it seem
Like nothing could ever break you
But I see right through
'Cause I am broken too
In all the same places as you

And if you needed proof
I'd reopen my wounds, reopen my wounds (Yeah)
I see myself in you (In you)
I know you can make it through
If you needed proof
I'll reopen my wounds
In all the right places for you
So now you see the truth
That you are broken too
I'll reopen my wounds for you

I keep making the same mistakes
Just to feel alive again
It's the only way to break on through
So stop numbing all the pain
Because it just won't go away (Won't go away)
If you only knew how much I needed you
And if you needed proof
I'd reopen my wounds (My wounds)
In all the right places for you
I can see the truth (The truth)
'Cause I am broken too

I am broken too
Broken just like you
