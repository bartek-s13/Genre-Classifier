…Three, four!

Wish I was ocean size
They cannot move you, man
No one tries
No one pulls you
Out from your hole
Like a tooth aching a jawbone
Oh

I was made with a heart of stone
To be broken with one hard blow, oh, oh
I've seen the ocean break on the shore
Come together with no harm done

It ain't easy living

I want to be
As deep
As the ocean
Mother ocean, yeah!


I want to be
As deep
As the ocean
Mother ocean, yeah!

Some people tell me
Home is up in the sky
In the sky, lives a spy, aye, aye
I want to be more like the ocean
No talking, man
All action
No talking, man
All action

Oh!

Get up, hey!
Get up, hey!
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Aah, ooh!
