Leave this world to die on its knees
On its knees
Rest in pain
Every song is a room where I watch myself bleed
Ghosts of lost love
Dreams of death just because
Leaving this world to die on its knees
On its knees
Are these the voices of my dead friends?
They put these words in my mouth
And this gun to my head
You and me bleed Death's melody
Dark Heart Ceremony
Hold our breath and we'll fade away
As sick as our secrets and we're both the same
Rest in pain
Embraced by the darkness of night
These words are my own prison
Lifeless inside
A pool of blood
A life that once was
Some things were never meant to be
Are these the voices of my dead friends?
They put these words in my mouth
And this gun to my head
You and me bleed Death's melody
Dark Heart Ceremony
Hold our breath and we'll fade away
As sick as our secrets and we're both the same
We're both the same
Rest in pain
Leave this world to die on its knees
Rest in pain
Hold our breath and let's fade away
Rest in pain
You and me bleed Death's melody
Dark Heart Ceremony
Hold our breath and we'll fade away
As sick as our secrets and we're both the same (x2)
Leave this world to die on its knees
Rest in pain
Hold our breath and let's fade away
Rest in pain
