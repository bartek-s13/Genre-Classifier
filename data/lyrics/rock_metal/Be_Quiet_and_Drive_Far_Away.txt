This town don't feel mine
I'm fast to get away, far

I dressed you in her clothes
Now drive me far away, away, away

It feels good to know you're mine
Now drive me far away, away, away

Far (Away)
I don't care where, just far
(Away)
I don't care where, just far
(Away)
I don't care where, just far
(Away)
I don't care

Far (Away)
I don't care where, just far
(Away)
I don't care where, just far
(Away)
I don't care where, just far
(Away)
I don't care
Far (Away)
I don't care where, just far
(Away)
I don't care where, just far
(Away)
I don't care where, just far
(Away)
Far (Away)
I don't care where, just far
(Away)
I don't care where, just far
(Away)
I don't care where, just far
(Away)
Away
So far (Away)
I don't care where, far
(Away)
I don't care where, just far
(Away)
I don't care where
