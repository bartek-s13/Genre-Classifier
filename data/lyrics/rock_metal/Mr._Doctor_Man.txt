Mr. Doctor Man questions his hands
Lost his mind, clinically fine
But he found a way to cope, needle in his throat
Falling down but the world is spinning 'round and 'round
He knows

Up, down, but the world keeps spinning 'round and 'round
I see this place ain't big enough for me
I want you to take me away-way-way, baby
Up, down, but the world keeps spinning 'round and 'round
I see this place ain't big enough for me
I want you to take me away-way-way
What you want to say?

Chemically, it's running through my veins, you see?
A romance of the plastic scenes, well I can't see you breathe
They're coming after me
Honestly, it's running through my veins, you see
I don't need their surgeries, I just want to be
They're coming after me

There's a little story I'd like to tell
About this little boy who came from Hell
Sit right there and listen real good
I'll tell you all the ways he's misunderstood
Well I see you standing there
With that ol' wicked stare
Just stay for the show
Are you ready now, are you ready to go?

Chemically, it's running through my veins, you see?
A romance of the plastic scenes, I can't see you breathe
They're coming after me
Honestly, it's running through my veins, you see
I don't need their surgeries, I just want to breathe
They're coming after me

I'm stuck in the boom boom room
People are dancing after their operations
I want you to move
But nobody's moving after their medications
I can hear the room
People are dancing after their operations
I want you to move
But nobody's moving at all
Chemically, it's running through my veins, you see?
A romance of the plastic scenes, I can't see you breathe
They're coming after me
Honestly, it's running through my veins, you see
I don't need their surgeries, I just want to be
They're coming after me

Oh no
Oh-oh no, no, no
Oh no no no
They're coming after me
Oh no
After me
Oh no
They're coming after me
