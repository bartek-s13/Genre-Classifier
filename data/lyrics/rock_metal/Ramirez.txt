I wanna see the pieces fit into place
I wanna feel your body temperature drop
I wanna feel the wind against my face
I wanna hear your heart stop
I have a perfectly good idea of how the fuck you're going to die
We fear what we don't understand
And I'm afraid of everything
Hail Mary, the virgin whore
I can't fucking take this anymore
Hail Mary with the broken face
You name the time I'll name the place
I wanna tell her I felt it in my heart
But I have no heart to feel
I wanna tell them I know who stole my soul
But I have no soul to steal
I believe that Hell is real
Hell is other people
I am a burning building
You can't save me
Hail Mary, the virgin whore
I can't fucking take this anymore
Hail Mary with the broken face
You name the time I'll name the place
I am the one who will bring Hell upon you all
I'll stand at the gates and watch your kingdom fall
Ashes to ashes, and dust into dust
This world is a graveyard
I DON'T GIVE A FUCK!
Hail Mary, the virgin whore
I can't fucking take this anymore
Hail Mary with the broken face
You name the time I'll name the fucking place
