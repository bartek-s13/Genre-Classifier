Territorial pissing contest, it sickens my nerves
Atrophy of morality, the people left to burn
A foregone conclusion, the lock before the key
Raised on ideology and imperial democracy
I don't care what you think you know
Go and leave it on your tombstone
Altering the conscious, you can see what fits
Making carnage of culture for your own benefit
Your purity is make believe, delusion spreading like a weed
Your logical fallacy is rational savagery
Crucifixation
Mental devastation
A spiritual mockery
Pure American hypocrisy
Territorial pissing contest, it sickens my nerves
Atrophy of morality, the people left to burn
A foregone conclusion, the lock before the key
Raised on ideology and imperial democracy
I don't care what you think you know
Go and leave it on your tombstone
Altering the conscious, you can see what fits
Indoctrinating violence for your own benefit
Corrupting everything you see, delusion spreading like a weed
