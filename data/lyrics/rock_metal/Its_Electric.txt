<<<<<<< HEAD
I'm gonna be a rock 'n' roll star
Gotta groove from night to day
Gotta blow my honey jar, yeah
Gotta blow my blues away
I'm gonna make a stand
I'm gonna make a million
I'm gonna make it with you
I'm gonna be with my friend
I'm gonna put you through
It's electric
It's electric
It's electric
It's electric
I stop on red but I leave on amber
Danger paves my way
I'm gonna make it my friend
Gonna make it today
Gonna get the dust from my heels
Down the highway I go
Gonna get the stars from my brow
Playing in a rock 'n' roll show
It's electric
It's electric
It's electric
It's electric
I stop on red but I leave on amber
Danger paves my way
I'm gonna make it my friend
Gonna make it today
Gonna get the dust from my heels
Down the highway I go
Gonna get the stars from my brow
Playing in a rock 'n' roll show
It's electric
It's electric
It's electric
