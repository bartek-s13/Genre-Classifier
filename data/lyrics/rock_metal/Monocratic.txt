God damn I spent so much time consuming myself with hope beating my mind to a bloody pulp only to forget
Everything I’ve done has left me nowhere
8 Years of me life already under contract serving a higher power this is for the ones who pull the strings
Day after day year after year I’m so fucking frustrated what doesn’t matter to you might mean something to me open your fucking eyes you might see what I can see this is all your doing and now it’s
Your fucking problem power Hungry the only thing on your mind is the next tier you are self absorbed selfish the people around you are nothing but numbers what doesn’t matter to you might mean something to me open your fucking eyes you might see what I can see
I’ve been bent backwards to only get dealt the short hand it’s dog eat dog who has the meanest bite
Who has the meanest bite the human factor plays no part in your mind the lack of meaning astounds me
