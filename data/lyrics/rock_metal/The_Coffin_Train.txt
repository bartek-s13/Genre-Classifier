A canvas made of skin
And painted by their tears
In the colours of the damned
The lies will tell the truth
In the suffocating lands
When the children die in the womb
It's an eye for an eye
On the scales of the coffin train
Seek redemption, repent and
Sell the divine’s dead love
The world hangs as a blind man
He writes in ink of blood and betrays the words
Their history paved with bones
And the horizon will unleash
Another chapter that's buried in ghosts
As time abandons youth
And their pillars fall enraged
A fate so infinitely mans
It's an eye for an eye
On the scales of the coffin train
Seek redemption, repent and
Sell the divine’s dead love
The world hangs as a blind man
He writes in ink of blood and betrays the words
And the world is set ablaze on a coffin train
And though all man is to blame
They're the ones who deserve to die
But we die first
And so it goes the fear it eats us up from inside
And in the end we're euthanizing all human kind
And then again time is a'running out
For the crows are a'calling
Before the dawn an empire might see their demise
At the hands of the young with the fire in their eyes
And in the end time will run out
For the coffins are awaiting
Get off the coffin train
Just get off the coffin train
Get off the coffin train
Yeah just take down the coffin train
Take down the coffin train!
