Dead in a ditch is where I dumped that little bitch
That'll teach a motherfucker to double cross me again
Your last mistake is that you thought we were friends
Then I wrapped you in plastic and I taped up the ends
Who I am in the dark? Who I am in the light?
Who I am in the day? Who I am in the night?
Now the rat is in the bag and the bag is in the river
Forgot about you already but at least I got a picture

I gave you what you got and you got what you deserved
I gave you what you got and you got what you deserved
I gave you what you got and you got what you deserved
You deserve what you get and you get what you deserve

Scratch a lie, scratch a lie, find a thief
I'll always find a way to get my relief
Scratch a lie, scratch a lie, find a thief
I'm always gonna try to betray and deceive
Scratch a lie, scratch a lie, find a thief
I'll always find a way to get my relief
Scratch a lie, scratch a lie, find a thief
My violence and vices are my own disease

Dead in the ditch is where I left that little monkey
My faults and corruption and addiction so ugly
Thought I broke the bottle but the bottle broke me
I was locked up and loaded and they threw away the key
Who you are in the dark? Who you are in the light?
Who you are in the day? Who you are in the night?
Got the monkeys on my bag but the bag's in the river
So here I go again I'm a repeat offender

I gave you what you got and you got what you deserved
I gave you what you got and you got what you deserved
I gave you what you got and you got what you deserved
You deserve what you get and you get what you deserve

Scratch a lie, scratch a lie, find a thief
I'll always find a way to get my relief
Scratch a lie, scratch a lie, find a thief
I'm always gonna try to betray and deceive
Scratch a lie, scratch a lie, find a thief
I'll always find a way to get my relief
Scratch a lie, scratch a lie, find a thief
My violence and vices are my own disease

Scratch a lie
Scratch a lie
Scratch a lie
Scratch a lie

Scratch a lie, scratch a lie, find a thief
I'll always find a way to get my relief
Scratch a lie, scratch a lie, find a thief
I'm always gonna try to betray and deceive
Scratch a lie, scratch a lie, find a thief
I'll always find a way to get my relief
Scratch a lie, scratch a lie, find a thief
My violence and vices are my own disease
Scratch a lie, scratch a lie, find a thief
I'll always find a way to get my relief
Scratch a lie, scratch a lie, find a thief
I'm always gonna try to betray and deceive
Scratch a lie, scratch a lie, find a thief
I'll always find a way to get my relief
Scratch a lie, scratch a lie, find a thief
My violence and vices are my own disease

Scratch a lie
Scratch a lie
Scratch a lie
Scratch a lie
