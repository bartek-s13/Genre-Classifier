How can I sleep?
When everyone else turns to dust
How can I breathe?
When my mouth is filled with their ashes
Another day lost
Trying to exit the program
I've seen enough to feed
My psychosis for a lifetime
Bloody Angel!

When did it start?
This force is too strong to resist
Where is too far?
All I did was try to save them
Haunted by screams
Chasing me back to my childhood
I cannot flee
I've got tormentors for a lifetime!

Come bloody angel
Break off your chains
And look what I found in the dirt
Pale battered body
It seems she was struggling
Something is wrong with this world
Bloody Angel!
All that I know
I'm willing to give it away
All that I love
Disappeared like sand in the ocean
Remember the lives
Lost with their withering pictures
Trying to hide
But I've seen
Tragedies through a lifetime
Bloody Angel!

Come bloody angel
Break off your chains
And look what I've found in the dirt
Pale battered body
It seems she was struggling
Something is wrong with this world
Fierce, bloody angel
The blood is on your hands
Why did you come to this world?
Everybody turns to dust  (Everybody turns to dust)
Everybody turns to dust  (Everybody turns to dust)
Everybody turns to dust  (Everybody turns to dust)
Everybody turns to dust  (Everybody turns to dust)
The blood is on your hands
The blood is on your hands
The blood is on your hands
The blood is on your hands!

Come bloody angel
Break off your chains
And look what I found in the dirt
Pale battered body
It seems she was struggling
Something is wrong with this world
Bloody Angel!
Bloody Angel!
