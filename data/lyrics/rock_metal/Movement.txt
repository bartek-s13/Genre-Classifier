Movement was the thing that made me stop, it made me stop
Movement was the thing that sent me off, it sent me off

Movement was my only tell
Runnin' through the door yelling, "What the hell?"
I'm moving while you talk your talk
Don't talk shit, you gon' break your jaw
Movement was my only chance
"Full speed ahead" was my only plan
I'm moving while you talk your talk
Don't talk shit, you gon' break your jaw

I'm movin', I've been on the run
Somebody better help me, son
I'm movin', I've been on the run
Somebody better save me, son

Who cares if you trace my same steps?
Somedays I wake up braindead
Hook me up on life support
Will somebody tell me what I'm fightin' for?
Same shit, still hits, now I'm runnin' up
Same shit, risin', I'm comin' up
Same shit, still hits, now I'm runnin' up
Same shit, risin', I'm comin' up, I'm comin' up
My movement's comin' up
Bitch, I'm comin' up
My movement's comin' up

Movement was my only tell
Runnin' through the door yelling, "What the hell?"
I'm moving while you talk your talk
Don't talk shit, you gon' break your jaw
Movement was my only chance
"Full speed ahead" was my only plan
I'm moving while you talk your talk
Don't talk shit, you gon' break your jaw

I'm movin', I've been on the run
Somebody better help me, son
I'm movin', I've been on the run
Somebody better save me, son

I speed up, I go faster
No shit, I just rolled right past ya
Hook me up on life support
Will somebody tell me what I'm fightin' for?
Same shit, still hits, now I'm runnin' up
Same shit, risin', I'm comin' up
Same shit, still hits now I'm runnin' up
Same shit, risin', I'm comin' up, I'm comin' up
My movement's comin' up
Bitch, I'm comin' up
My movement's comin' up
