I refuse to let go of the memories
'Cause they've changed everything inside of me

If I could go back now to save myself the loss
Substanceless character brought back would be the cost
Agony today is tomorrow's strength
So don't run away 'cause misery is
Evolving into something that we can't see
Evolving and becoming, transforming
So don't run away

The pain can never be erased
Remain and turn it into strength, turn it into strength

What do we value in the midst of complacency?
But in despair, we beg for something, anything
Even our mistakes can have the power
To light the way like a glaring tower

The pain can never be erased
Remain and turn it into strength
From our failures, we are refined
Replacing frailty, allowing us to be redefined
Healed scars can be stronger than skin
The wounds we have can be rewritten
Redefined, redefined, redefined
Agony today is tomorrow's strength, redefined
So don't run away

The pain can never be erased

The pain can never be erased
Remain and turn it into strength
The pain can never be erased
Remain and turn it into strength
From our failures, we are refined
Replacing frailty, allowing us to be redefined
From our failures we are refined
Replacing frailty, allowing us to be redefined

Don't run away
Misery's evolving
