<<<<<<< HEAD
Morning came and I was on my way, when you reminded me
I had too soon forgotten, it was you who set me free
Yeah you were here when I came and you'll be here when I'm gone
So don't be waiting for love, cause I'll be waiting to ramble on
Headed for a heartbreak, headed for a heartbreak
Darling don't wait up for me, tonight I won't be home
You've become a stranger, I just got to be alone
Don't need nobody on my side to dull the blade I'm on
So don't be waiting for love, cause I'll be waiting to ramble on
Headed for a heartbreak, headed for a heartbreak, headed for a heartbreak
It's no mistake, don't you think I can feel the pain
I walk away to live again
(Solo)
Headed for a heartbreak, headed for a heartbreak, don't make me hurt you
Headed for a heartbreak, well I know that I'm headed for a heartbreak
Don't you think I feel the pain...
