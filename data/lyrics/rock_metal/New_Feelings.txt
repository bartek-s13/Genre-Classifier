Sroll away the chains that wrap around me
Wipe the spider webs from my eyes
Tumble down the tall walls that surround me
I won't need no lies no alibis
My new feeling
New feeling (x5)
Daydreams screams
They just don't seem so far away
No I'm not possessed by my possessions
Lift my head to clear my right to die
You're in love with your evangelist investment
I don't need an alibi
My new feeling
New feeling (x5)
Daydreams screams
They just don't seem so far away
My head's like a wrecking ball and you look like a wall
Mopping up the tears that fill your eyes
This is my life, my right and that's not all
I just laughed my head off and cried
My new feeling ...
