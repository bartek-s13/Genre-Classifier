Let me down easy if you can
I'm not half as strong as you think I am

It may seem like I don't care, baby, that's just my disguise
Look closer and you'll see I'm still a kid behind the eyes
I'm barely on my feet and one more lick would put me down
Show a little mercy, honey, I'm pleadin' with you now

Let me down easy if you can
I'm not half as strong as you think I am
I guess I'll try to take it like a man
Let me down easy if you can

Maybe I'm the crazy one, 'cause there ain't no way it's you
I guess I'll let you go 'cause it's the least that I could do
Hopefully I'll make it and I'll be alright in time
I'll prob'ly go to pieces now, but darlin' you'll be fine

Let me down easy if you can
I'm not half as strong as you think I am
Someday when we're older, we'll look back on this and smile
I thought I had it handled, baby, I missed it by a mile

Let me down easy if you can
I'm not half as strong as you think I am
I guess I'll try to take it like a man
Let me down easy if you can
