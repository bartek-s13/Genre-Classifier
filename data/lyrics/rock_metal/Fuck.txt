Hello, hello, hello, hello, hell no!
Hello, hello, hello, hello, what the fuck?
Hell no! Who? Me? Bitch!

Who turned into irrelevant?
You tried to do, show me proof
Who turned into? They must have used you
Show me proof, I'm fucking too crude, fuck you too
I'm bustin' through, swoop, I'm comin' through
I'm fucking too crude, fuck you too
I'm bustin' through, swoop
I'm comin' through, I'm bustin' through

Enough! I fuck it up, bitch, I fuck it up
No, I fuck it up, bitch, I fuck it up
No, I fuck it up, bitch, I fuck it up
No, I show no love, that's why I'm fucking up

Fuck, lemme get a bit in stuck
Lemme get your mindset, bitch, this what?
Everything I said now, lemme get around
Put me in the ground, probably six feet down
I guess, lemme split your head in two
Bitch, I seen what the fuck you want do?
I guess, lemme get you back on your feet
Bitch, I see what the fuck you really need

Enough! I fuck it up, bitch, I fuck it up
No, I fuck it up, bitch, I fuck it up
No, I fuck it up, bitch, I fuck it up
No, I show no love, that's why I'm fucking up

Fuck that little shit
Hit your head, you little bitch
Bitch, I do what I wanna do
It's my number one, you're my number two
Kung Pung with the bass I go
Young man with the face you know
Some shit that ya never seen
Tell me what the fuck you think

Enough! I fuck it up, bitch, I fuck it up
No, I fuck it up, bitch, I fuck it up
No, I fuck it up, bitch, I fuck it up
No, I show no love, that's why I'm fucking up

Fuck, bitch, this I've seen
This is your everything
Fuck, bitch, this I've seen
This is my everything
Fuck, bitch, this I've seen
This is your everything
Fuck, bitch, this I've seen
This is my everything
