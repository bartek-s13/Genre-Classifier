Did I stop and watch the sunset fade?
What gave me life and took my breath away?
Did I take a last-call stranger home
So I wouldn't have to wake up alone?

I heard I was a wild one
Actin like a child, son
But I really don't recall
Heard I was a fast one
Always was last one
Waitin' for the other shoe to fall
I've seen pictures
And I've heard stories
'Bout the boy I used to be
But I don't remember me

Was I just another ghost in this town?
Who was I when no one was around?
Did I even know that I was livin' without?
Who are my favorite songs about?

I heard I was a wild one
Actin like a child, son
But I really don't recall
Heard I was a fast one
Always was last one
Waitin' for the other shoe to fall
I've seen pictures
And I've heard stories
'Bout the boy I used to be
But I don't remember me

Was my heart beatin' in my chest?
And was I even alive before the day we met?

I heard I was a wild one
Actin' like a child, son
Heard I was a fast one
Always was last one
Waitin' for the other shoe to fall
I've seen pictures
And I've heard stories
'Bout the boy I used to be
But I don't remember me
No, I don't remember me before you
