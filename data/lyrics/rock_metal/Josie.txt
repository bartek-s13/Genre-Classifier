Josie took a cab out of town
And then she turned it around
She said "they'll never let me leave this place"
She gave the cabbie her money
And said "don't look down"
He didn't have a clue what she was talkin' about

All the locals know her as Jo
She drinks Manhattans and wears gentlemen's clothes
She likes to get high when she's low
And break the hearts of boys for the fun of it all

Josie rides closely to the line
She's high and, she's tryin' to survive
Born with a little bit of trouble in her eyes
Josie rides closely to the line
Go Josie go, go Josie go

Johnnie cut a deal for an album, that he never put out
He's got a place and a bed, for when he's coming down
Josie sees something, that he don't see in himself
And now she looks the other way, when he's fucking around

All the locals say they don't know
Why she lives so fast, and she moves so slow

Josie rides closely to the line
She's high and, she's tryin' to survive
Born with a little bit of trouble in her eyes
Josie rides closely to the line
Go Josie go

It's okay, don't change
Just throw it all away
It's okay, don't change
Just throw it all away
Go Josie go, go Josie go
Just throw it all away
It's okay, don't change
Go Josie go

All the locals know her as Jo
She drinks Manhattans and wears gentlemen's clothes
She likes to get high when she's low
And break the hearts of boys for the fun of it all

Josie rides closely to the line
She's high and, she's tryin' to survive
Born with a little bit of trouble in her eyes
Josie rides closely to the line
Go Josie go

Josie rides closely to the line
She's high and, she's tryin' to survive
Go Josie go
