Over and under, do you go down to the sea
Oh yeah
Sweet and timely caress, dear babe fulfilling me
Oh yeah
I can feel her heart, it is beating down inside
Oh yeah
Tasty
Into her valley, all her charms taste of love
Oh yeah
Fragrance of my dreams, yeah go down, take my love
Oh yeah
Taste my bitter wine, cuz it is boiling up inside
Oh yeah
Tasty
Faster
Make me go.....
Love
Shoot me
Faster, faster
Love, sucking my love
