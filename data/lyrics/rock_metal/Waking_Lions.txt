Is this better
Tell me there's a better way
I'm not afraid
I'm not gonna hide from the vultures above, serpents below
They wanna lay me to rest, but I won't go
Yeah
Is it better to die than live another day
I'm not afraid
I'm not gonna run from the scars and within, burning your skin
They wanna lay me to rest, but I won't go
Yeah, I won't go
I wanna stand up, a hundred feet tall
'Cause fear will never lead the way
I'm ready to run, a hundred miles strong
I will never be the same
Waking the lions in me
I'm waking the lions in me
Waking the lions in me
Waking the lions in me
Burning to ash, I'll die until I rise again
I'm not afraid
I'm not gonna stop till I
Break down this cage
Escape from these chains
You'll never silence my voice
No, I won't go
No, I won't go
I wanna stand up, a hundred feet tall
'Cause fear will never lead my way
I'm ready to run, a hundred miles strong
I will never be the same
Waking the lions in me
I'm waking the lions in me
Waking the lions in me
Waking the lions in me
Far way too long
I slept inside the dark
But now I rise
It's time to make a move
Waking the lions in me
Waking the lions in me
Waking the lions in me
I wanna stand up, a hundred feet to
'Cause feel we never lead my way
I'm ready to run, a hundred my strong
I will never be the same
I wanna stand up, a hundred feet tall
'Cause fear will never lead my way
I'm ready to run, a hundred miles strong
I will never be the same
Waking the lions in me
I'm waking the lions in me
Waking the lions in me
Waking the lions in me
I'm waking the lions in me
