<<<<<<< HEAD
I was born Friday the 13th
In a town of limestone and penitentiaries
Can't blame it on all bad luck
The way I fucked things up

I've got a heart in me, I swear
It's sittin' in the back of a bar somewhere
Everything you've heard is true
But I can make it up to you

I've got so much love to give
I've got so much more than this
Forgive me, for everything I did
I've got so much love to give

I might die on a Saturday night
And wake up Sunday on the wrong side of paradise
I'm rehearsed and overdressed, I'm a goddamned mess

But I've got a head on me, I swear
It's sittin' in the back of the bar somewhere
Everything you've heard is true
But I can make it up to you, yeah
I've got so much love to give
I've got so much more than this
Forgive me, for everything I did
I've got so much love to give

I've got so much left to be
I've got so much left in me
Me, me

I've got a heart in me, I swear
It's sittin' in the back of a bar somewhere
Everything you've heard is true
Let me make it up to you

I've got so much love to give
I've got so much more than this
Forgive me, for everything I did
I've got so much love to give

I've got so much more than this
Forgive me, for everything I did
