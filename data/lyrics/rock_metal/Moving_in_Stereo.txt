Life's the same, I'm moving in stereo
Life's the same except for my shoes
Life's the same, you're shaking like tremolo
Life's the same, it's all inside you

It's so easy to blow up your problems
It's so easy to play up your breakdown
It's so easy to fly through a window
It's so easy to fool with the sound

It's so tough to get up
It's so tough
It's so tough to live up
It's so tough on you

Life's the same, I'm moving in stereo
Life's the same except for my shoes
Life's the same, you're shaking like tremolo
Life's the same, it's all inside you

Life's the same, I'm moving in stereo
Life's the same except for my shoes
Life's the same, you're shaking like tremolo
