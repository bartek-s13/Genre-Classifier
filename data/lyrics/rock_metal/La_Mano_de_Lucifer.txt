La Mano de Lucifer
A failed rebellion against the one creator
Exiled to the fires in every clergy’s fable
Nine circles to render the heart bloodless
But it’s better to reign in hell
Than to serve God’s will
As he takes his seat upon a dark-winged unicorn
And he points his finger toward the red-eyed children
La Mano de Lucifer
Persevere wayward angel
Swiftly swings the sword of eternal flames
Conjured up by the declaration of his name
La Mano de Lucifer
Persevere wayward angel
La Mano de Lucifer
Persevere wayward angel
Hold on to the fallen son, his breath will guide you along
Hold on to the fallen son, his breath will guide you along
A hunter’s collection of tormented souls
He’s known for the breaking of rules of the old
But it’s better to reign in hell
Than to serve God’s will
