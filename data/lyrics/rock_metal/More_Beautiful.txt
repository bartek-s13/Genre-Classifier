Don't ever think you're broken or not good enough
Cause all the things you wanna fix are things that I love
I'll tell you now, there's nothing for your to hide
I know who are inside, you're all that I need
Don't listen to the voices saying otherwise
Look into my eyes, listen to me

You have never been more beautiful
Than you are now and you don't even know
Don't be afraid of being vulnerable
'Cause you have never been, never been more beautiful

You don't see yourself the same anymore
And say I don't look at you like I did before
Those imperfections give you insecurities
But they fit you perfectly, don't change a thing
They make you who are and you are who I want
I'm begging from my heart, so won't you listen to me?

You have never been more beautiful
Than you are now and you don't even know
Don't be afraid of being vulnerable
'Cause you have never been more beautiful
You have never been more beautiful
Than you are now and you don't even know
Don't be afraid of being vulnerable
'Cause you have never been more beautiful

Just show me what you've covered
It'll make me only want you more
'Cause I'm aching to discover
If there's any other scars I haven't seen before
It's true I don't look at you like I did before
'Cause when I look at you now, I want you even more

You have never been more beautiful
Than you are now and you don't even know
Don't be afraid of being vulnerable
'Cause you have never been more beautiful
You have never been more beautiful
Than you are now when the real you shows
There's no shame in being vulnerable
'Cause you have never been, never been more beautiful
You have never been more beautiful
