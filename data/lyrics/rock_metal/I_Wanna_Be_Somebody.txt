You say you don't wanna run and hide
A face that no-one knows
And everyone ya meet, you're gonna show
You're nobody's slave, nobody's chains are holdin' you
You hold your fist up high
And rule the zoo
Oh, you just got to be
Up high where the whole world's watchin me
Cause I, I got the guts to be somebody......to cry out
I wanna be somebody
Be somebody soon
I wanna be somebody
Be somebody too
You say you don't wanna starve
Or take the table crumbs that fall
You don't wanna beg or plead at all
You don't want no nine to five
Your fingers to the bone
You don't want the rock piles' bloody stones
Oh, you just got to be
Up high where the whole world's watchin me
Cause I, I got the guts to be somebody.....to cry out
I wanna be somebody
Be somebody soon
I wanna be somebody
Be somebody too
I want shiny cars and dirty money
Lotsa rock and roll
I will live in fame and die in flames
I'm never gettin' old
I wanna be somebody
Be somebody soon
I wanna be somebody
Be somebody too
I'm gonna be somebody
