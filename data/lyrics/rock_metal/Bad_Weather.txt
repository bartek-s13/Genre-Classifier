This place looks like everything you wanted
Red roses, white doves, and such
Church wedding bells, the hell is she thinkin'?
There’s no green 'round her finger from us
I came to this place fully conscious
Well aware that my actions are unjust
That man up there said I'd have to hold my peace forever
Unless something’s said now and stand up
That's the reason I came here in the first place
So forgive me for what I'm to say
After so many years, forever and ever
Turned into bad weather today

And the rain came down
Washed away all that he'd found
What's the reason for keepin' them around?
Can't place them together

That house on the hill there's a prison
Spent too many years turned to hell
Oh, how if those old walls could listen and hear me
Oh, how much these old walls could tell
As an old man, I know I should reason
But I could torch this old place, might as well
With a can full of diesel, and a booklet of matches
Let’s see what these ashes unveil

And the rain came down
And washed away all that he found
What’s the reason for keepin' them around?
Can’t place them together
Yeah, the rain came down
Washed away all that he found
What's the reason for keepin' them around?
Blow over, bad weather
Blow over, bad weather
