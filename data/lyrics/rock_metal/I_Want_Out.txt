From our lives' beginning on
We are pushed in little forms
No-one asks us how we'd like to be
In school they teach us what to think
But everyone says different things
But they're all convinced that
They're the ones to see
So they keep talking and they never stop
At a certain point you give it up
So the only thing that's left to think is this
I want out
To live my life alone
I want out
Leave me be
I want out
To do things on my own
I want out
To live my life and to be free
People tell me A and B
They tell me how I have to see
Things that I have seen already clear
So they push me then from side to side
They're pushing me from black to white
They're pushing till there's nothing more to hear
But don't push me to the maximum
Shut your mouth and take it home
Cause I decide the way things gonna be
I want out
To live my life alone
I want out
Leave me be
I want out
To do things on my own
I want out
To live my life and to be free
There's a million ways (million ways) to see the things in life
A million ways to be the fool (million ways)
In the end of it, (in the end) none of us is right
Sometimes, we need to be alone (alone, alone, alone)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Leave me alone
To live my life alone
I want out
Leave me be
I want out
To do things on my own
I want out
To live my life and to be free
I want out
