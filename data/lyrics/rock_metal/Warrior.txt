Warrior
Warrior

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
I can feel the blades cutting in my skin, but there's a will within
I'm looking it straight in the eye, there's nothing to fear
I am brave like a warrior

Be brave
Let the blood flow and feed your hunger
Fear is nothing to a warrior
Don't be scared, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger

I am not afraid of tomorrow, no
I've got the brave heart of a warrior, of a warrior
Even at the end of the road, I'd go on
I've got the strong heart of a warrior, of a warrior

Gotta choose your battles wisely, set all pride aside
I am brave, I'm a warrior
Be strong
You can do whatever you set your mind to
Uncover the courage that lies within you
You can move mountains, you can break rocks

I am not afraid of tomorrow, no
I've got the brave heart of a warrior, of a warrior
Even at the end of the road, I'd go on
I've got the strong heart of a warrior, of a warrior

Warrior, warrior
Of a warrior, of a warrior
Warrior, warrior
Of a warrior, of a warrior

Got the heart of a warrior
Got the heart of a warrior

I am not afraid of tomorrow, no
I've got the brave heart of a warrior, of a warrior
Even at the end of the road, I'd go on
I've got the strong heart of a warrior, of a warrior
Warrior, warrior
Of a warrior, of a warrior
Warrior, warrior
Of a warrior, of a warrior
