(I saw your ghost in my reflection
I saw a darkness in the heart
I saw a shred of hope
I saw the world tear it apart
Our world is cold and empty)

I saw your ghost in my reflection
I saw a darkness in the heart
I saw a shred of hope
I saw the world tear it apart
I try and piece together
The parts of me that I want the world to see
But the mirror stares back, ever black, reminding me
Our world is cold and empty

I saw you slip
Into shallow pools of blood and blue
Servants of dark desire
Find shelter in a needle and fire
I starve the demons
But you still feed them
Another rush to the vein
In a lust to escape each ripple of pain

Tiny angels
In tiny hells
Contradictions
I know so well

Torment
When you can't move forward
Sinking slower then the mind breaks
Another casket lowered that I can't take
Sober
Carry your cross through lonely winters
My curse, my fate, my ghost
Beside me she whimpers
Our world is cold and fucking empty
An endless cycle of suffering
The pain has never fucking left me
Into the mirror ever black I see

Tiny angels
In tiny hells
Contradictions
I know so well

I saw your ghost in my reflection
I saw a darkness in the heart
I saw a shred of hope
I saw the world tear it apart
I try and piece together
The parts of me that I want the world to see
But the mirror stares back, ever black, reminding me
Our world is cold and empty

My curse, my fate, my ghost
I'd die before I let you go
My curse, my fate, my ghost
I'd die before it lets me go
Let me go
Let me go
