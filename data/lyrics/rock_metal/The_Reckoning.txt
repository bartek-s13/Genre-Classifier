<<<<<<< HEAD
As cold as stone, they march in darkness
Enslaving the young and killing their fathers
But soon they'll know the path they've chosen
Has carved their faith in stone

In blood and tears, a thousand times
We rise against, we'll always hold the line of reckoning

Red tears run down like a river
Don't close your eyes, it won't disappear
No fear you wanna end the pain
Don't let go, don't back down, hold the line, we'll bring the reckoning
(Bring the reckoning)

In blood and tears, a thousand times
We rise against, we'll always hold the line of reckoning

We're all alone, walking in twilight
The night has been long, and so many have fallen
Feel no remorse, light will be breaking
Our freedom is worth it all
In blood and tears, a thousand times
We'll rise against, we'll always hold the line of reckoning

Red tears run down like a river
Don't close your eyes, it won't disappear
No fear you wanna end the pain
Don't let go, don't back down, hold the line, we'll bring the reckoning

I see your face, find peace of mind
Between the madness and the sadness and the fire burning
The end of war, the great divine
We'll see the day of reckoning

In blood and tears, a thousand times
We rise against, we'll always hold the line
In blood and tears, a thousand times
We'll rise against, we'll always hold the line of reckoning
We'll bring the reckoning
In blood and tears, a thousand times
