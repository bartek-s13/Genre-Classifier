Well, I'm tellin' you man, I ain't no fool
If you come along with me, you gotta be dead cool
'Cause we're rockin' and a-rollin' on the Marie Celeste
'Cause dead pirate cats really know how to rock the best
Tell your moms and pops, you won't be late
They don't matter 'cause we just can't wait
'Cause we're rockin' and a-rollin' on the Marie Celeste
'Cause dead pirate cats really know how to rock the best
Now, all you cats like to stroll and bop
Come with me and dance till you drop
'Cause we're rockin' and a-rollin' on the Marie Celeste
'Cause dead pirate cats really know how to rock the best
Now, all you cats like to stroll and bop
Come with me and dance till you drop
'Cause we're rockin' and a-rollin' on the Marie Celeste
'Cause dead pirate cats really know how to rock the best
Well, I'm tellin' you man, I ain't no fool
If you come along with me, you gotta be dead cool
'Cause we're rockin' and a-rollin' on the Marie Celeste
'Cause gone Polecats really know how to rock the best
