Drivin' on 9
You could be a shadow
Beneath the street light
Behind my home
Drivin' on 9
I sure miss you
Pass a motel
Looking at the pines
Drivin' on 9
Looking for one thirty
Maybe I passed it
Go another mile

Drivin' on 9
Drivin' on 9

Drivin' on 9
I'll sure look pretty
Carson City
Walking down the aisle
Drivin' on 9
Does daddy have a shotgun?
He said he'd never need one
Go another mile

Drivin' on 9

Drivin' on 9
Looking out my windowsill
Wondering if I want you still
Wondering what's mine
