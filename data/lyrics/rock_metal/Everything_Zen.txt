There must be something we can eat
Maybe find another lover
Should I fly to Los Angeles
Find my asshole brother
Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Dave's on sale again
We kissy kiss in the rear view
We're so bored, you're to blame
Try to see it once my way
Everything zen, everything zen
I don't think so
Everything zen, everything zen
I don't think so
Raindogs howl for the century
A million dollars at stake
As you search for your demigod
And you fake with a saint
There's no sex in your violence
There's no sex in your violence
There's no sex in your violence
There's no sex in your violence
Try to see it once my way
Everything zen, everything zen
I don't think so
Everything zen, everything zen
I don't think so
Everything zen, everything zen
I don't believe that Elvis is dead
I don't believe that Elvis is dead
I don't believe that Elvis is dead
I don't believe that Elvis is, Elvis is
There's no sex in your violence
There's no sex in your violence
There's no sex in your violence
There's no sex in your violence
Try to see it once my way
Everything zen, everything zen
I don't think so
Try to see it once my way
Everything zen, everything zen
I don't think so
Zen, zen
I don't think so
I don't think so
