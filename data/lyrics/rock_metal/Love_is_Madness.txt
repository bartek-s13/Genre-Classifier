You are insane, my desire
A violent daydream, love, love
You are crazy, a perfect liar
Said you'd save me, love, love

I knew the moment I looked into your eyes
I'd have to swallow all your lies

I never said that I would be your lover
I never said that I would be your friend
I never said that I would take no other, be your lover
Never said

You are insane, my desire
A dangerous game, love, love
You are crazy, perfect liar
Simply save me, love, love

I knew the moment I looked into your eyes
I'd have to swallow all your lies
I never said that I would be your lover
I never said that I would be your friend
I never said that I would take no other, be your lover
Never said
Oh, woah, no, oh, no, woah
Love is madness

I knew the moment
I knew the moment
I knew the moment
Love is madness
I knew the moment I looked into your eyes
I knew the moment I looked into your eyes
I knew the moment I looked into your eyes
Love is madness
Oh, whoa

I never said that I would be your lover
I never said that I would be your friend
I never said that I would take no other, be your lover
Never said
Oh, woah, no, oh, no, woah
Love is madness
Love is madness
