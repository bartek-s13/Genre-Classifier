<<<<<<< HEAD
I can’t get away with murder
I am bound to take it further

I took the pills, I’ve been consumed
I drank the water, I had to choose
I’m still here with a fire burning, burning inside
If you want to burn, light it up, light up, let it rise

When you’re high who ya flying for
When you ride who ya riding for
When you toast who ya drinking for
When you play, gotta deal with the devil

Gotta deal with the devil
Gotta deal with the devil
Gotta deal with the devil

I have found comfort in sorrow
Now I’m bound, empty and hollow

I took the pills, I’ve been consumed
I drank the water, I had to choose
I’m still here with a fire burning, burning inside
If you want to burn, light it up, light up, let it rise
When you’re high who ya flying for
When you ride who ya riding for
When you toast who ya drinking for
When you play, gotta deal with the devil

Gotta deal with the devil
Gotta deal with the devil
Gotta deal with the devil
Let it rise

When you’re high who ya flying for
When you ride who ya riding for
When you toast who ya drinking for
When you play, gotta deal with the devil

Gotta deal with the devil
Gotta deal with the devil
Gotta deal with the devil
Gotta deal with the devil
Gotta deal with the devil
Gotta deal with the devil
Gotta deal with the devil
