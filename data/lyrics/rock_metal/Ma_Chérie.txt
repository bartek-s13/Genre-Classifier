Well I can’t seem to make you smile
Anymore, anymore ,yeah
What happened to the dresses
You wore before, wore before?

Well, I see, I see
You dancing tonight
Under, under his street light
Well, I see, I see
You drifting away from me, baby

Ma Cherie
Oh, time won't be enough
To make you even fall in love with me
Prefer the needle to me
Wanna hold you in my arms
But you want nothing to do with me
Ma Cherie

Well, I can’t seem to make you love me today
Oh, today (oh, today)
Just want to see that frown go away (see that frown go away)
Well, I see, I see
You dancing tonight
Under, under his street light
Well, I see
You driftin' away from me (you driftin' away from me)
Baby

Ma Cherie
Oh time won't be enough
To make you fall in love with me
The needle or me?
Well, I loved you and you walked away from me
It’s the little, little things
That you do, baby
That make me so damn crazy
Wanna see
Wanna hold you in my arms
But you want nothing to do with me

Oh, when you walked away
I’ll always remember that day, oh
She couldn’t love me anymore
She just walked out the door
I just need her to stay, baby, I know
Ma Cherie
Oh, time won't be enough
To make you fall in love with me
The needle or me?
Well I loved you and you walked away from me
It’s the little, little things
That you do, baby
That make me so damn crazy
Wanna see
Wanna hold you in my arms
But you want nothin' to do with me (nothin' to do with me)

Ma Cherie (ma cherie)
Oh, time won't be enough
To make you fall in love with me
The needle or me? (the needle or me)
Well, I loved you and you walked away from me
It's the little, little things
That you do baby
That make me so damn crazy
Wanna see (wanna see)
Wanna hold you in my arms
But you want nothin' to do with me (nothin' to do with me)
(the needle or me, the needle or me, the needle or me)
Oh, Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma Cherie

Ma Cherie
Oh time won't be enough
To make you fall in love
The needle or me?
Want to hold you in my arms
But you want nothin' to do with me
