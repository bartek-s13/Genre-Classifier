Drive at night, in the slow lane
Rabbit in the headlights, run away, run away
The great escape in the slow lane
Before it's too late to run away, run away
The life we left behind
Sleeping all our lives
The life we left behind
Dreaming all our life
We ride on hearts
Design our world
Let go of you and I
Run for our lives
