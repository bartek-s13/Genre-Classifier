I don't know
I don't know
I don't know anymore
Thought I had
Thought I had it under control
Hear my voice there it goes
Hear it louder than most
Here it goes, hear it (1 2 3 4)
It's not worth it
It's not workin'
You wanted it to be picture perfect
It's not over, you don't have to throw it away
So scream if you wanna, shout if you need
Just let it go (take it out on me)
Fight if you need to, smash if you have to
Get control (take it out on me)
Scream if you wanna, shout if you need
Just let it go (take it out on me)
Fight if you need to, smash if you have to
Get control
You try to move, try to move
Try but don't wanna lose
You So afraid, so afraid
You don't want it to fade
Hear my voice, there it goes
Hear it louder than most
Let it go, let it (1 2 3 4)
