Cloud Spiller
Well, I went down to the water, just to wipe my brow
My head felt so heavy, like a broken down levee
And to my surprise I met that lake’s lovely child
Well, oh yeah how she sheds her light
The one thing that keeps me alive
She fell down right from the sky
Eyes from the north got plenty of reasons why
Cloud spiller, she saved me
And now I’m free
After I shook the hooks of that succubus
The sun left its radiance and ran for the coast, oh
The cries of Skinwalkers cuts through the night
Oh yeah how she sheds her light
The one thing that keeps me alive
She fell down right from the sky
Eyes from the north got plenty of reasons why
Cloud spiller, she saved me
And now I’m free
Gravity’s my only enemy
Why do you have to pull down on me?
Gravity’s my only enemy
Why do you have to pull down on me?
Oh baby, keep me alive!
She fell down right from the sky
Eyes from the north got plenty of reasons why
Cloud spiller, she saved me
And now I’m free
