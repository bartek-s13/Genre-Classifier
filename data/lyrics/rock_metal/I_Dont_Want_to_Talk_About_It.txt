I can tell by your eyes that you've probably been crying forever
And the stars in the sky don't mean nothing to you; they're a mirror

I don't want to talk about it
How you broke my heart
If I stay here just a little bit longer
If I stay here, won't you listen to my heart?
Oh, my heart
You know what baby

If I stand all alone, will the shadow hide the color of my heart?
Blue for the tears
Black for the night's fears
The stars in the sky don't mean nothing to you, they're a mirror

I don't want to talk about it
How you broke my heart
If I stay here just a little bit longer
If I stay here, won't you listen to
...Oooh  ....heart

I don't want to talk about it
How you broke my heart
If I stay here just a little bit longer
If I stay here, won't you listen to my heart?
Oh, my heart
My heart
Oh, my heart
