She rides
Let loose upon the world
She is the night
And my loneliness in bondage
She's black
And sin runds down her back
She rides
From the daylight in chains

She rides the night
She rides the night

She slides
Down inside your skin
In time
She will make you scream
She's death
In a cool black dress
She rides
In the night of your mind

She rides the night
She rides the night
Yea
She'll take you down
She'll take you
She'll take you around

She rides
Let loose upon the world
She is the night
And my loneliness n bondage
She's black
And sin runs down her back
She rides
From the daylight in chains

She rides the night
She rides the night

Ooh yea
She'll take you down
She'll take you

She rides
