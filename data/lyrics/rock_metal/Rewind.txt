<<<<<<< HEAD
Staring here at these white walls
An empty canvas on my downfalls
No illusion greater than fear
Try to overcome but my vision's unclear
'Cause all my good intentions been tangled up
All my hopes been buried, gotta dig 'em up
All my life I've been trying not to mess it up
You know I had enough
Lay me down, carry me away
Let the clock unwind the years on tape
Rewind, start again
If I turn back before I break
I pray my soul my soul to take
Rewind, start again
Caught in the clouds, wishing for blue skies
Rolling the river, bound to capsize
If I could grab the wheel and just steer
Try to overcome, the directions unclear 'cause...
All my words I've been saying get tangled up
All my steps coming down seem to trip me up
All my life I've been trying not to mess it up
You know I had enough, yeah
Lay me down, carry me away
Let the clock unwind the years on tape
Rewind, start again
If I turn back before I break
I pray my soul my soul to take
Rewind, start again
Lay me down, take me to the river
Wash away, tell me you'll deliver me
And lay me down, I'm still alive
Rewind, deliver me, deliver me
Lay me down, carry me away
Let the clock unwind the years on tape
Rewind, start again (Deliver me)
(Deliver me, deliver me)
If I turn back before I break
I pray my soul my soul to take
Rewind, start again (Deliver me)
(Deliver me, deliver me)
Rewind, deliver me, deliver me
Rewind, start again
If I turn back before I break
I pray my soul my soul to take
