I find this scientifically fascinating
Running in circles
So it seems
Running in circles
Never ends, tragically
You are stuck, stuck in time
Unlike me, gliding free
So linear
Just like a dog
Dirt on your paws
Just like a dog
You dig your own grave
Run
Show your teeth
Now play dead
Show your teeth
Now play dead
Show your teeth
Now play dead
Show your teeth
Now play dead
All bark no bite, you dumb little bitch
