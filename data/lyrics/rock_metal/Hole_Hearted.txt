Oooh yeah wooh!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah

Life압 ambition occupy my time
Priorities confuse the mind
Happiness one step behind
This inner peace I've yet to find

Rivers flow into the sea
Yet even the sea is not so full of me
If I앐 not blind why can't I see
That a circle can앖 fit where a square should be?

There압 a hole in my heart
That can only be filled by you
And this hole in my heart
Can앖 be filled with the things I do
Hole hearted
Hole hearted

This heart of stone is where I hide
These feet of clay keep warm inside
Day by day less satisfied
Not fade away before I die
Rivers flow into the sea
Yet even the sea is not so full of me
If I앐 not blind why can앖 I see
Ooh, that a circle can앖 fit where a square should be?

There압 a hole in my heart
That can only be filled by you
And this hole in my heart
Can앖 be filled with the things I do

There압 a hole in my heart
That can only be filled by you
Should have known from the start
I앇 fall short with the things I do
Hole hearted,  hole hearted
Hole hearted,  hole hearted
Hole hearted,  hole hearted
Yeah
