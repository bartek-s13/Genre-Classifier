Ooh-ooh, ooh-ohh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ohh

I知 a sinner, I will consider
I am my father痴 son
I'm a sinner, I must consider
I've never owned a gun
I知 a sinner, seasoned beginner
Lucky to be alive
I知 a sinner, finished my dinner
Now I can go outside

If only yesterday took place tomorrow
I壇 pray for sleep
And wake you and lift your head
So I can fix your hand
I値l be your handyman (Handyman)

I知 not brittle, I知 just a little scared of your temperament
I知 not brittle, I知 just a little scared of my government
I知 not brittle, head hurts a little
Staring up overhead
I知 not brittle, I知 just a riddle
Born of white, blue and red
If only yesterday took place tomorrow
I'd pray for sleep
And wake you and lift your head
So I can fix your hand
I値l be your handyman (Handyman)

Do do do-do
Do do do-do-do
Do do do-do-do do
Do do do-do
Do do do-do-do
Do do do-do-do do
Do do do-do
Do do do-do-do
Do do do-do-do do
Do do do-do
Do do do-do-do
Do do do-do-do do

If only yesterday (Oooh)
Took place tomorrow (Oooh)
I'd pray for sleep (Oooh)
And wake you and lift your head (Oooh)
So I can fix your hand
I値l be your handyman
Handyman
