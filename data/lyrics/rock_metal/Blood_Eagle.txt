We come for war
King of the north and Norse
With drums beating, screams repeating and the hammer force of Thor
Surrender not enough
The Christian seed will sing amongst the soil of trees
From the sea is the destroyer
From the sea is the eagle drenched in blood
Blood eagle
Blood eagle is the destroyer
Blood eagle will set the wicked free

Rip the body from the bone now
Spread the heavens' wings
Show Valhalla glory and memory
Let 년m, let 년m
Let the Christians sing
Rip the body from the bone now
Spread the heavens' wings
Show Valhalla glory and memory
Let 년m
Let 년m
Let 'em sing

Let out the roar
Barbaric to the core
A storm brewing, all our doing for Odin's at the door
The spoils are not enough
We뇳l let 년m bleed
The moon takes everyone tonight

The Christians sing
How they sing amongst the broken wings
From the sea is the eagle drenched in blood
The Christians sing
How they sing amongst the broken wings
A soul descending swiftly
The burning stench of afterlife
No rays from heaven
Only high sea
A soul descending swiftly
The burning stench of afterlife
No grace from heaven
And no sun
Pleading to the sky once more
Weeping for the self
For the abandoned children of Christ have been laid to waste on the shelf

Pour out the tide of Valkyries
The land is ours to claim
No man or woman escape the fire
Pour out the tide of Valkyries
The land is ours to claim
No man or woman escape the fire
Now let 년m sing
Now sing
(The tide of Valkyries)
(The tide of Valkyries)
Now sing


We come for war
King of the north and Norse
With drums beating, screams repeating and the hammer force of Thor
Surrender not enough
We뇳l let 년m bleed
The moon takes everyone tonight

(A soul descending swiftly
The burning stench of afterlife)
We come for war
We come for war
We come for war
