Lost in the maze of the back streets I struggled
Fighting my way through a whole lot of trouble
Too many people were talking without moving their mouths
So many days, so many nights, ever wondered
About the lies that have stolen my thunder
In the haze of my mind all the wires were crossed
I love you but I'm lost

From a flame to the spark of an ember
To a fire on the fifth of November
We have strayed from the light
Now we count the dots
I love you but I'm lost
I love you but I'm lost

Look at the marks on your arms, all the colors
How you like to make them pay (how you like to make them pay)
These are the reasons why your life is not quite what it was
In a dream at the edge of a river
Where we swam and I watched you shiver
Came to life in my arms and then turned to dust
I love you but I'm lost
From a flame to the spark of an ember
To a fire on the fifth of November
We have strayed from the light
Now we count the dots
I love you but I'm lost
I love you but I'm lost

All we needed was some time
All we needed was some time
All we needed was some time
All we needed was some time

I love you but I'm lost
I love you but I'm lost
I love you but I'm lost
I love you but I'm lost
I love you but I'm lost
I love you but I'm lost

I love you but I'm lost
