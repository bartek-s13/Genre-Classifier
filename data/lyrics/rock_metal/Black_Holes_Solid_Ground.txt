<<<<<<< HEAD
Broken down so I walk the line
I drown my wounds in iodine
I'm out of money, I'm out of time
I fly low like a broken arrow
Time slows and my vision narrows
I'm out of money, I'm out of time

Sing your hearts out sing it loud
Make me happy make me proud
Black holes, solid ground
Black holes, solid ground
A thousand voices set 'em free
Because this silence is killing me

I’m still alive beneath the rubble
A wretched soul in a sea of trouble
I'm all alone
I'm all alone
Start the fire, set it off
Good intentions are wearing out
I don't know I'm all alone (Yeah)

Sing your hearts out sing it loud
Make me happy make me proud
Black holes, solid ground
Black holes, solid ground
A thousand voices set 'em free
Because this silence is killing me
Woah oh oh
Woah oh oh
Woah oh oh
Woah oh oh
Woah oh oh
Woaaahh
I'm fighting the fever again
Woah oh oh
Woah oh oh
Woah oh oh
Woah ooooooooh ooohh
Woah oh oh
Woah oh oh
Woah oh oh
I'm fighting the fever
Woah oh oh
Woah oh oh
Woah oh oh

Sing your hearts out sing it loud
Make me happy make me proud
Black holes, solid ground
Black holes, solid ground
A thousand voices set 'em free
Because this silence is killing me
