I tried to be perfect, but nothing was worth it
I don’t believe it makes me real
I thought it’d be easy, but no one believes me
I meant all the things I said

If you believe it’s in my soul, I’d say all the words that I know
Just to see if it would show that I’m trying to let you know
That I’m better off on my own

This place is so empty, my thoughts are so tempting
I don’t know how it got so bad
Sometimes it’s so crazy that nothing can save me
But it’s the only thing that I have

If you believe it’s in my soul, I’d say all the words that I know
Just to see if it would show that I’m trying to let you know
That I’m better off on my own, on my own!


I tried to be perfect, it just wasn’t worth it
Nothing could ever be so wrong
It’s hard to believe me, it never gets easy
I guess I knew that all along
If you believe it’s in my soul, I’d say all the words that I know
Just to see if it would show that I’m trying to let you know
