Bite that lip
Cause your tongue is a gun and your brain is the trigger
Fire at will
Oh I doubt that mouth could get any bigger
You live in hypocrisy, those skies are always sunny
You're never gonna be a threat to anybody
You're lying, you're lying
You're gonna be the one left crying
If you bring a gun, baby, we'll bring an arsenal
If you think we're done, baby, we'll bring it, we'll sing it
Open your eyes and see you are outnumbered, honey
You're never gonna be a threat to anybody
You'll never get this dance tonight
So split, oh you can run till you're done but the shame will never leave ya
Had your fun, was it worth all the time getting people to believe ya?
Open your eyes and see it never was that funny
You're never gonna be a threat to anybody
You're lying, you're lying
You're gonna be the one left crying
If you bring a gun, baby, we'll bring an arsenal
If you think we're done, baby, we'll bring it, we'll sing it
Open your eyes and see you are outnumbered, honey
You're never gonna be a threat to anybody
You're lying, you're lying
You're gonna be the one left crying
You're lying, you're lying
You're never satisfied
You're lying, you're lying
You're gonna be the one left crying
You're lying, you're lying
Till there's no one on your side
If you bring a gun, baby, we'll bring an arsenal
If you think we're done, baby, we'll bring it, we'll sing it..
If you bring a gun, baby, we'll bring an arsenal
If you think we're done, baby, we'll bring it, we'll sing it
Open your eyes and see you are outnumbered, honey
You're never gonna be a threat to anybody
A threat to anybody
A threat to anybody
A threat to anybody
