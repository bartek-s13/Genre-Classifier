You!
Why do they always send the poor?

Barbarisms by Barbaras with pointed heels
Victorious victories kneel for brand new spanking deals
Marching forward, hypocritic and hypnotic computers
You depend on our protection, yet you feed us lies from the table cloth

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, ooh-ooh
Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshine

Kneeling roses disappearing into Moses' dry mouth
Breaking into Fort Knox, stealing our intentions
Hangars sitting dripped in oil, crying, "Freedom"
Handed to obsoletion, still, you feed us lies from the table cloth

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, ooh-ooh
Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshine
Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshine
Blast off, it's party time
And we don't live in a fascist nation
Blast off, it's party time
And where the fuck are you?

Where the fuck are you?
Where the fuck are you?
Why don't presidents fight the war?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why don't presidents fight the war?
Why do they always send the poor?

Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshine
Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sun
Where the fuck are you?
