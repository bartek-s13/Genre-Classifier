Streets like a jungle, so call the police
Following the herd down to Greece on holiday
Love in the '90s is paranoid
On sunny beaches, take your chances looking for

Girls who want boys who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone you really love

Avoiding all work 'cause there's none available
Like battery thinkers, count your thoughts on one, two, three, four, five fingers
Nothing is wasted, only reproduced
You get nasty blisters, du bist sehr schön, but we haven't been introduced

Girls who want boys who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone you really love
Girls who want boys who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone to really love

Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
