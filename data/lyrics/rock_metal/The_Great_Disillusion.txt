How could I have been so fucking blind?

Look out, look out, look by your side
Sometimes the devil wears a pretty disguise
So reach out, cry out, open my eyes
Show me my future before I kiss it goodbye

And you told me we could fly
So I hold on and once again
Once again I leave it all behind
You told me we could swim
So I climbed so high up to a mountain for you
I closed my eyes, and I took the dive

How can I make up for all this lost time?!

The scent of home sweet home
Now bears the bitterest smell
And the land I was meant to love
Feels like a short stay in hell
Feels like a short stay in hell
It's time to let go
And you told me we could fly
So I hold on and once again
Once again I leave it all behind
You told me we could swim
So I climbed so high up to a mountain for you
I closed my eyes, and I took the dive

How can I make up for all this fucking lost time?
That I'll never ever get back
25 to life
I thank you for, thanks for wasting my time
Time I'll never ever, ever ever get back
How could I have been so fucking blind?!

And you told me we could fly
So I hold on and once again
Once again I leave it all behind
You told me we could swim
So I climbed so high up to a mountain for you
I closed my eyes, and I took the dive

And I took the dive
And I took the dive
You told me could fly
So I hold on and once again
Once again I leave it all behind
You told me we could swim
So I climbed so high up to a mountain for you
I closed my eyes...
Life is so fucking bad
