I will sit right here and bide my time
As long as it takes, to get what's mine

And I won't be denied
And all I got left is my pride
And I will rise up

Breaking out, break you down
Break the rules, break new ground
Had your chance, now it's gone
A new day, a new dawn

I will sit right here and I will wait
But sooner than later, it's your last mistake

And I won't be denied
And all I got left is my pride
And I will rise up

Breaking out, break you down
Break the rules, break new ground
Had your chance, now it's gone
A new day, a new dawn
I control my own fate
Now, for you, it's too late
It's my dream, it's my way
It's my life, it's your pain! Oh, no!

And I won't be denied
And all I got left is my pride
And I will rise up

Breaking out, break you down
Break the rules, break new ground
Had your chance, now it's gone
A new day, a new dawn

And I won't be denied
And all I got left is my pride
And I will rise up

Breaking out, break you down
Break the rules, break new ground
Had your chance, now it's gone
A new day, a new dawn

A new dawn
