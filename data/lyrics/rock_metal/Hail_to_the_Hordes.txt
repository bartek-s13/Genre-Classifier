Build me a nation, a fountain of life
And let us be the voice
For what words cannot express
The failed, the outcasts
The sagacious and wise
Will form a bond, impeccable art
Crafted through eons of time
If night will fall black shadows
Are taking our sight
We carry each other
Through the darkest moments in life
Stronger than hate
Stronger than fear, stronger than all
We are one
Hail to the hordes
We are one
Hail to the hordes
Build me a nation, let's make a stand
Live our lives to the full
Come let's walk hand in hand
Let us remember, what it once meant
To be no Untertan
No God and no government
If night will fall black shadows
Are taking our sight
We carry each other
Through the darkest moments in life
Stronger than hate
Stronger than fear, stronger than all
We are one
Hail to the hordes
We are one
Hail to the hordes
If night will fall black shadows
Are taking our sight
We carry each other
Through the darkest moments in life
Stronger than hate
Stronger than fear, stronger than all
We are one
Hail to the hordes
We are one
Hail to the hordes
