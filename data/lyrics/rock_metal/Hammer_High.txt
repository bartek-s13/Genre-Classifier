Hammer high this is a freedom cry
Hammer high, no one should ask me why
It's my life - proudly I will defy
Hammer high until I die!

Black clouds on the horizon
Dread crimson skies
The thunder within
The sign to begin
A tempest of fire and ice
I keep my courage blazing
Withhold these grounds
Protecting the steal
This is my deal
The flames of thy anger and my will!
Remember the frozen tears
Turning each second to years
I meltdown in paradise
Revolution calling, break the ice!

Hammer high this is a freedom cry
Hammer high, no one should ask me why
It's my life - proudly I will defy
Hammer high until I die!

The rapid fire pounding
To the beat of my heart
Let's make a stand
True to till the end
Warrior under command
I'm melting the frozen ice
Burning the books filled with lies
And inside the pouring rain
Things will never ever be the same!

Hammer high this is a freedom cry
Hammer high, no one should ask me why
It's my life - proudly I will defy
Hammer high until I die!

The strong will survive
In the end, it's the game
Forever defy
Hammer high up in the sacred sky!

Hammer high this is a freedom cry
Hammer high, no one should ask me why
It's my life - proudly I will defy!
Hammer high until I die
Hear me now this is a freedom cry
It's my life - no one should ask me why
Hammer high I won't conform and I
Will defy until I die
Hammer high this is a freedom cry
Hammer high, no one should ask me why
It's my life - proudly I will defy
