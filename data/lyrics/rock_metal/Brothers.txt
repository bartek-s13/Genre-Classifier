In a Thousand Lifetimes
We Have Sailed the Seven Seas
Climbed the Highest Mountains
We Have Crossed the Desert Plains
Fought and Died in Many Battles
It Feels Like an Endless War
Warring Sprits Take Their Toll
Finding Strength With Kindred Souls
I Will Help Carry Your Pain
For Me I Know You'll Do the Same
Especially Through the Hardest Times
I'm Always Standing By Your Side
Whether Lawless and Enraged
Born in Chaos For the Stage
We Are Meant to Live this Life
Getting Strong With Every Fight

Brothers Standing Side By Side
Our Bond Will Never Falter
Brothers Ready For the Fight
Forged With Strength and Honor
Brothers Standing Side By Side
We'll Set the World on Fire
Brothers Ready For the Fight
Take Our Sprits Higher
The Ties that Bind Us Will Not Break
Many Others Will Forsake
Attempt to Conquer and Divide
All Have Failed, Some Have Tried
Moving Forward We Will Triumph
And Our Trust Will Never Crumble
Every Challenge We Will Face
Our Bond Is Stronger Everyday

Brothers Standing Side By Side
Our Bond Will Never Falter
Brothers Ready For the Fight
Forged With Strength and Honor
Brothers Standing Side By Side
We'll Set the World on Fire
Brothers Ready For the Fight
