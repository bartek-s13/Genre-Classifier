It never quits, it never stops
If I close my eyes don't wake me up
When the time comes I'll sleep forever
See you in my dreams
See you never
Sing me to sleep
Scare me to death
Sing me to sleep
Scare me to death
Sing me to sleep
Scare me to death
Sing me to sleep
Scare me to death
Every day above ground is a curse
Nothing you do to me could fucking make it worse
There is no glimmer no chance of hope
You'll find a noose at the end of my rope
So fucking worthless, you serve no purpose
I see you shaking, you should be nervous
I am here to make you well again
Here to make your life a living hell again
Deliver you from evil
Deliver a dose that is lethal
Breathe in the sickness
Exhale the plague
Breathe in the sickness
Exhale the plague
Breathe in the sickness
Exhale the plague
Breathe in the sickness
Exhale the plague

So fucking worthless
You serve no purpose
With your hands around my neck
Begging you to bring me death
