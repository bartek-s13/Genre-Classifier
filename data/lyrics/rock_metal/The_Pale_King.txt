I was awakened by the howling of the dog
Or perhaps a wolf
Summoned by the voices who are shouting in my ear
The pale king comes from afar
Before the time
Who will decide
I live to see one thousand moons
I am weak
I am ill
I am old with the taste for the kill
All that I've seen in the years that I possess
Faces I don't recognize
Summoning the ancients with the evil that awaits
Read from the book of the dead
Zone of the gods
Below the sea
I've traveled amongst the stars
I am life
I am death
I control the gates of this world
The pale king's reign condemns this world
They're doing time til the end of their lives
Falling
Travelling throughout this world
Falling
Falling from the skies
Taken from the prophecy
As they control your mind
The pale king holds your fate
One hundred thousand years and counting
One hundred million more to go
Throughout his life he keeps on searching
The pale king makes this world his own
And the seals of these are written herein
Yet others I must take with me
The spirit and daemon no longer known
Anu have mercy on my soul
