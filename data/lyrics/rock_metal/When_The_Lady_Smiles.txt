When the lady smiles
You know it drives me wild
Her lips are warm and resourceful
When her fingertips
Go drawing circles in the night
Then the mood is soft and sensual, hu-u
And I love it, yeah I love it
It's the answer to all my dreams
Every time it feels like the earth is shakin'
It doesn't matter, a glass is fallin'
I hear it shatter
Maybe it's raining, faster and faster, shadow dancin'
Together oh I, I'm a bettin' on the game of love
Oh oh oh I, I'm bettin' that love is gonna come out
When the walls no longer shout, back at me
And I'm feelin' proud
When the lady smiles
She holds me in her hand
As a matter of fact
She could always let me down
But when the lady smiles
I can't resist her call
As a matter of fact
I don't resist at all
'cos I'm walking on clouds
And she is leadin' the way
My friends tell me
She's the beast inside your paradise
I guess you've heard it all before
A fallen angel
That has got you hypnotized
And that always needs some more, hu-u
And I love it, yeah I love it
She's done nothin' to mislead me
'cos every time we meet
The earth is shakin'
It doesn't matter, a glass is fallin'
I hear it shatter, maybe it's rainin'
Faster and faster, shadow dancin'
Together oh I, I'm bettin' on the game of love
Oh oh oh I, I'm bettin' that love is gonna come out
When the walls no longer shout, back at mea
Nd I'm feeling proud
When the lady smiles
She holds me in her hand
As a matter of fact, she could always let me down
But when the lady smiles
I can't resist her call
As a matter of fact
I don't resist at all
'cos we're walkin' on clouds
And she is leadin' the way
Oh no, oh no, oh nooooo......
