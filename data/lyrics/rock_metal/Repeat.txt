Libraries of all of these memories I never touch
I only look back to see where I don't want to go again
Barely sleep, but I see it all in my dreams
Goes as far as I can see
But believe me, all I need is to believe

Only violence, need to not think
I need something to hold on
I'm out on the road, love that's left alone
She's saving him for herself, not saving him for his own
Love's best left alone, tears dry on their own
And the queen of the broken hearts
Feels better off left alone, she'll be better off left alone

I see words, D-I-D
Leave it on repeat, oh, I see
I see words, D-I-D
Leave it on repeat, oh, I see

Better off left alone
She'll be better off left alone
Better off left alone
Oh, I chew her out cause she’s the only one
Time and time again she tries to pull apart
Love, I love you much, but we are going down
Oh, I’m on my own, I am the only one
Yeah, she’s swinging moods just like my mother do
Oh, I see the tension overcoming you
Yes, the cruel intentions start to shine through
Girl, I couldn’t help but fall in love with you
Oh, I like the bad bitch, too
I like ‘em cause they tell the truth
Something you couldn’t ever do
I know you’re watching all my moves
I do believe I’m leaving you
How loving when everyone just goes along
Time and time again, gotta mosey on
Leave it awful, damn, I am the only one
Leave it all on you, I am the lonely one

I see words, D-I-D
Leave it on repeat, oh, I see
I see words, D-I-D
Leave it on repeat, oh, I see
I see words, D-I-D
Leave it on repeat, oh, I see
I see words, D-I-D
Leave it on repeat, oh, I see
I see words, D-I-D
Leave it on repeat, oh, I see
I see words, D-I-D
