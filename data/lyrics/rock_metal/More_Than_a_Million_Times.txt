<<<<<<< HEAD
Sometimes I wake up in the morning
And I reach across the bed for you
Nothin' is left except your memory
I can't believe we're really through
After we meant so much
I can't forget your touch
Habits are hard to break
You're one I just can't shake
More than a million times
I've tried to get you off my mind, and
More than a million nights
I've dreamed of how we held each other tight
More than a million times
All I can do is think about you
I close my eyes and see your face
Since you've been gone you're my obsession...oooh
Something inside I can't erase
After we meant so much
I can't forget your touch
Habits are hard to break
You're one I just can't shake
More than a million times
I've tried to get you off my mind, and
More than a million dreams
Remind me how it used to be
More than a million times
I've tried to get you off my mind, and
More than a million nights
I've dreamed of how we held each other tight
More than a million times
Maybe I'm dreamin'
Maybe you're home
But when I wake up
Baby you're still gone
(Solo)
More than a million times
I've tried to get you off my mind, and
More than a million dreams
Remind me how it used to be
More than a million times
I've tried to get you off my mind, and
More than a million nights
I've dreamed of how I held you tight
More, more, more
More than a million times
I said more, yeah more
More than a million times
Yeah more, yeah more
More than a million times
I said more, yeah more
