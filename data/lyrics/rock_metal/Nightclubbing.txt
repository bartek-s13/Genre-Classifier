Nightclubbing, we're nightclubbing
We're what's happening
Nightclubbing, we're nightclubbing
We're an ice machine
We see people brand new people
They're something to see

Nightclubbing, we're nightclubbing
Bright-white clubbing
Oh isn't it wild?

Nightclubbing, we're nightclubbing
We're walking through town
Nightclubbing, we're nightclubbing
We walk like a ghost
We learn dances brand new dances
Like the nuclear bomb

When we're Nightclubbing
Bright-white clubbing
