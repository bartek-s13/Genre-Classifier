Sun went down, sun went down over Pompeii
On both sides, a vow was broken
Oh my, my, I'm the one
Trying to hide this damage done
One day, all our secrets will be spoken

As we slow danced, I became your statue, frozen
Times I wonder are we just a puff of smoke? Yeah
Underneath this bed of ashes, still withholding everything
Like we were never close

Don稚 you worry, baby, no sense trying to change it
I'ma strike these matches, never had control
I'm ready to let go, no, was I fooling myself?
I知a spread these ashes, never had control
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready to let go

Sun went down, sun went down over Pompeii
On holy ground, our vows were broken
We met up, we broke bread
I was blue, your dress was red
Ain't it strange?
We both knew this day was coming

As we slow danced, I became your statue, frozen
Times I wonder are we just a puff of smoke? Yeah
Underneath this bed of ashes, still withholding everything
Like we were never close

Don't you worry, baby, no sense trying to change it
I'ma strike these matches, never had control
I'm ready to let go, no, was I fooling myself?
I知a spread these ashes, never had control
I知 ready, I'm ready, I知 ready to let go

Don't you worry, baby, no sense trying to change it
I'ma strike these matches, never had control
I'm ready to let go, no, was I fooling myself?
I知a spread these ashes, never had control
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready to let go
