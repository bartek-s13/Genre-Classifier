Watching the flames fill up the sky
When the world is on fire, we need to remember who we are
We're losing grip bit by bit, is it worth fighting for it?
Losing time day by day, are you gonna leave or stay?

If the choices we make define who we are
Then this is who I am, I'll never let go
When our worlds collide, when our worlds collide
I will never let go when our worlds collide

Just like a supernova exploding
Our two worlds are colliding, we are endlessly falling
Just like a photograph ageing, fading
The cracks are slowly breaking, and we are slowly changing

I'm watching the flames painting the sky
The world is on fire
Losing grip bit by bit, is it worth fighting for it?
Fading away piece by piece, struggling hard to breathe

If the choices we make define who we are
Then this is who I am, I'll never let go
When our worlds collide, when our worlds collide
When our worlds collide
When our worlds collide
When our worlds collide
When our worlds collide

Just like a supernova exploding
Our two worlds are colliding, we are endlessly falling
Just like a photograph ageing, fading
The cracks are slowly breaking and we are slowly changing

If the choices we make define who we are
Then this is who I am, I will never let go
When our worlds collide, when our worlds collide
When our worlds collide
When our worlds collide
When our worlds collide
When our worlds collide
