I was lost in translation
TRANSIENT LOVE
Then you pulled up in a Nova
It was over, yeah
I found a personal salvation
In your omniscient eyes
Did it hurt when you fell?
Probably not, I could tell

You're like
Kali Durga Radha Sita Saraswati Parvati
I would love to lay you
Way up in the Himalayas
No, no need to modest, baby
You appear to be A GODDESS, babe
Sweet, unholy thoughts of you
LET US PRAY
Oh, heavenly father, wherever you are
Could this be mine, all mine, all mine?

YOUR BODY IS A TEMPLE
It just might be the temple of doom
Got an Indiana Jones for you, baby
There's no telling what I might do

You're like
Kali Durga Radha Sita Saraswati Parvati
I would love to lay you
Way up in the Himalayas
No, no need to modest, baby
You appear to be A GODDESS, babe
Sweet, unholy thoughts of you
LET US PRAY
