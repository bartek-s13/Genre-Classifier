You look at me
And call me I-D-I-O-T
You laugh and turn your back
'Cause I'm not like you're supposed to be
But it's not a question
A question of low IQ
Cause if it was, well then the answer
Wouldn't be me but you

A-K-A I-D-I-O-T
Don't know who the Hell I'm supposed to be
I-D-I-O-T
(A-K-A I-D-I-O-T)
A-K-A I-D-I-O-T
Yeah, that's me
I-D-I-O-T
(A-K-A I-D-I-O-T)

I put up with being laughed at
'Cause I put up with being me
And then on artificial someone says
I'm the I-D-I-O-T
But I got motivation, yeah
I pretty much love it all
To make your artificial nation
Stumble and fall

A-K-A I-D-I-O-T
Don't know who the Hell I'm supposed to be
I-D-I-O-T
(A-K-A I-D-I-O-T)
A-K-A I-D-I-O-T
Yeah, that's me
I-D-I-O-T
(A-K-A I-D-I-O-T)

I know that I'm a screw up
I know I'm in a band
I know that I am up against
A mighty mighty man
But I'm satisfied with being
Being one of the lucky few
Who'll be the ones laughing knowing that
The joke is gonna be on you-
(A-K-A I-D-I-O-T)

A-K-A I-D-I-O-T
Don't know who the Hell I'm supposed to be
I-D-I-O-T
(A-K-A I-D-I-O-T)
A-K-A I-D-I-O-T
Yeah, that's me
I-D-I-O-T
(A-K-A I-D-I-O-T)
