I fight fire with fire
And I run rivers in rain
A fever spreading like wild
Gonna kill like Abel and Cain

Nobody to see, nobody to lose
Young blood on the street, been blackened & bruised
Get ready for me, I’m ready for you
Go sharpen the blade, bear witness to truth
Oh, my, those teeth are pearly white, the better to eat you with

Oh, my
Hey
My heavy metal dreamer
Hey
Get ready for some third rail love
Hey
My pretty little demon
Hey
Burn bright like the midnight sun

Rage like Eve in the garden
The sweetest fruit you can bear
When the riptide’s draggin’ you under
Are you gonna drown?

Nobody to see, nobody to lose
Young blood on the street, been blackened & bruised
Get ready for me, 'cause I’m ready for you
Go sharpen the blade, bear witness to truth
Oh, my, those teeth are pearly white, the better to eat you with

Oh, my
Hey
My heavy metal dreamer
Hey
Get ready for some third rail love
Hey
My pretty little demon
Hey
Burn bright like the midnight sun

Burn, burn bright like the midnight sun
Burn bright like the midnight sun
Burn bright like the midnight sun
Burn bright like the midnight sun
Burn bright like the midnight sun
Burn bright like the midnight sun

Hey
My heavy metal dreamer
Hey
Get ready for some third rail love
Hey
My pretty little demon
Hey
Burn bright like the midnight sun
