Foundation cracks
The wounds are bleeding
The end is calling
The end...is here
You're in a deathgrip, you're in a deathgrip
(Deathgrip!)
Death will know my name
You're at the world's end, you're at the world's end
(World's end!)
I will be the last one standing
I can see the end
It’s staring right back at me
I brought us here
A place laid to waste by humanity
The storms destroy
The quakes awaken
The end is calling
The end...is here
You're in a deathgrip, you're in a deathgrip
(Deathgrip!)
Death will know my name
You're at the world's end, you're at the world's end
(World's end!)
I will be the last one standing
I can see the end
It’s staring right back at me
I brought us here
A place laid to waste by humanity
In a life of choice I chose to deny
Through all of my sins, I chose to die
There will be nothing when I've lost it all
Please God, let this end painlessly
My memories are like a noose around my neck
I could never let go of all the regrets
Deathgrip!
You're in a deathgrip, you're in a deathgrip
(Deathgrip!)
Death will know my name
You're at the world's end, you're at the world's end
(World's end!)
I will be the last one standing
I can see the end
It’s staring right back at me
I brought us here
