In the early morning hours there's a din in the air;
Mayhem's on the loose
Stormtroopers comin', and you better be prepared
Got no time to choose

Get ready. Stormtroopers comin'

Comin' up that street, jackboots steppin' high
Got to make a stand
Looking in your windows and listen to your phone
Keep a gun in your hand

Get ready. Stormtroopers comin'
Get ready. Stormtroopers comin' around

Two hundred down, and it's comin' 'round again
Got no second choice
Where's the justice and where's that law
Raise your healthy voice

Get ready. Stormtroopers comin'
We'll be ready. Stormtroopers comin'
Getting ready. Stormtroopers comin'
