It's the end of the world and nobody cares
We got problems of our own
So nobody stares at themselves in the mirror anymore
A good hard look can shake you to the core, so

Do you know who you are?
Part of the solution or the one at fault, yeah
Look in your heart

Pull the pin, be careful where the fragments go
Live for yourself, don't care about collateral
Damage and such don’t mean too much
When your heads stuck up in your own asshole
It's easy not to see (so easy)
To be blind to the fact that the problems
That lay before us as a we (as a we)
Were created by a lack of our respect, so

Do you know who you are?
Part of the solution or the one at fault, yeah
Look in your heart
In your heart
Do you know, yeah, who you are?
In your heart


Yeah, do you know who you are?
(I do, I do, I know who I am)
Part of the solution or the one at fault
(Cause today I'm standing up)
Look in your heart
In your heart
Do you know, yeah, who you are?
