<<<<<<< HEAD
The times are changing so fast I wonder how long it lasts
The clock is ticking, time is running out
The hatred fills this earth and for what it's worth
We're in the end before we know
Throughout the years I have struggled
To find the answer that I never knew
It strucked me like a million lightnings
And here I am telling to you
Every second of day it is coming your way
Future unknown it is here to stay
Got to open your mind or you will be led to astray
There's a time to live, there's a time to die
But no one can escape their destiny
Whoa, yeah
Look all these things we've done under the burning sun
Is this the way to carry on?
So take a look at yourself and tell me what do you see
A wolf in clothes of the Lamb?
Throughout the years I have struggled
To find the answer that I never knew
It strucked me like a million lightnings
And here I am telling to you
Every second of day it is coming your way
Future unknown it is here to stay
Got to open your mind or you will be led to astray
There's a time to live, there's a time to die
But no one can escape their destiny
Let your spirit free through window of your mind
Unchain your soul from hate, all you need is faith
I control my life, I am the one
You control your life but don't forget your destiny
It's time to say goodbye, I know it will make you cry
You make your destiny, I know you'll find the way
And outside the sun is bright the things we'll be alright
