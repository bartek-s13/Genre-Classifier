Life

Things keep ending up this way
Another notch is carved away
In the thoughts of mass decay
Funny how things end up this way

Beaten down
Dominated by its sound
Growing deep within my head
Softly dying, its soul is shed
Eating me all up inside
This cancer finds everything I hide
Living my life horrified
Nothing will keep this pacified and out my life

Life
That's not right out insane

Satisfaction is delayed
Its motivation is displayed
Flaunting its misogyny
Funny how I thought it'd go away
Beaten down
Dominated by its sound
Growing deep within my head
Softly dying, its soul is shed
Eating me all up inside
This cancer finds everything I hide
Living my life horrified
Nothing will keep this pacified and out my life

Life
That's not right out insane

I'm constantly beat up inside
And I'm the one to blame
No one can relate to me
That's not right out insane
That's not right out insane
That's not right out insane
That's not right out insane
That's not right out insane
That's not right out insane
That's not right out insane
That's not right out insane
Beaten down
Dominated by its sound
Living my life horrified
Nothing will keep this pacified and out my life

Beaten down
Dominated by its sound
Growing deep within my head
Softly dying, its soul is shed
Eating me all up inside
This cancer finds everything I hide
Living my life horrified
Nothing will keep this pacified and out my life
