My Girlfriend's a dick magnet
My Girlfriend's gotta have it
She's hot, can't stop, up on stage, doing shots
Tip the man he'll ring the bell
Get her drunk she'll scream like hell
Dirty girl, gettin' down
Dance with guys from outta town
Grab her ass, actin' tough
Mess with her she'll fuck you up
No one really knows if she's drunk or if she's stoned
But she's coming back to my place tonight
She likes to shake her ass
She grinds it to the beat
She likes to pull my hair
When I make her grind her teeth
I like to strip her down
She's naughty to the end
You know what she is, no doubt about it
She's a bad, bad girlfriend
Red thong, Party's on
Love this song, sing along
Come together, leave alone
See you later back at home
No one really knows if she's drunk or if she's stoned
But she's coming back to my place tonight
I say no one really knows just how far she's gonna go
But I'm gonna find out later tonight
Chorus
She likes to shake her ass
She grinds it to the beat
She likes to pull my hair
When I make her grind her teeth
I like to strip her down
She's naughty to the end
You know what she is, no doubt about it
She's a bad, bad girlfriend!
Doesn't take her long to make things right
But does it make her wrong to have the time of her life?
The time of her life
My girlfriend's a dick magnet
My girlfriend's gotta have it
She's a gold digger
Now you figure out it's over
Pull the trigger
Futures finished, there it went
Savings gone, the money spent
Look around and all I see
No good, bad and ugly
Man she's hot and fixed to be
The future ex-Miss Connolly
Chorus
She likes to shake her ass
She grinds it to the beat
She likes to pull my hair
When I make her grind her teeth
I like to strip her down
She's naughty to the end
You know what she is, no doubt about it
She's a bad, bad girlfriend!
She's a bad, bad girlfriend
She's a bad, bad girlfriend
