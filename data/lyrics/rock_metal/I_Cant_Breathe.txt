I'm walking away
You're hurt, and I am to blame
Who's right or wrong?
What does it matter now anyway?
Sorry I fucked up for this hurtful breakup
But I cannot change who I am

Uh oh, the skies are red
Better run, better run, gonna end up dead
Dead and gone, dead and gone, dead and gone
Uh oh, the skies are red
Gotta make, gotta make this right if it's not too late
Too little, too late

I wanna say that I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused
I wanna tell you I'm sorry for the mistakes I've made
And I hope it's not too little, not too late
'Cause I can't breathe, I can't breathe
I can't breathe, oh, I can't breathe
I can't breathe, oh, I can't breathe

Who's right or wrong?
What does it matter now anyway?
Sorry I fucked up for this hurtful breakup
But I cannot change

Uh oh, the skies are red
Gotta make this right, gonna end up dead
Dead and gone, dead and gone, dead and gone

I wanna say that I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused
I wanna tell you I'm sorry for the mistakes I've made
And I hope it's not too little, not too late
'Cause I can't breathe, I can't breathe
I can't breathe, oh, I can't breathe
I can't breathe, oh, I can't breathe

I wanna say that I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused
I wanna tell you I'm sorry for the mistakes I've made
And I hope it's not too little, not too late
'Cause I can't breathe, I can't breathe
I can't breathe, oh, I can't breathe
I can't breathe, oh, I can't breathe
