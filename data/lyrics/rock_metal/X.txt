I just wanted to write this note to all my opposition
To say thank you from the pit of my soul for your caustic inspiration
My methods may mean nothing to you as you question my dedication
But to wear my life upon my sleeve is the source of my salvation
Hostility
Brutality
Is building up inside of me
I'm raging like a fire as I burn
I give myself to all of you no matter what you say or do
But I'm expecting nothing in return
Disgrace me or embrace me
You can choose to love or hate me
Better fucking know I've got something to say
You masticate and you spit me out
You picked me up to knock me down
No matter what I'm always the prey
I'm exposed
X X
Heart open wide
X X
So mark the X on me
Stab your horns into my eyes
Bear my soul
X X
Transparent life
X X
So mark the X on me
Stab your spears into my side
I just want to say these words to those who give respect
Let's lose our minds
Tear the walls down and break some fucking necks
I've fought the fight every day
I've won a few gave some away
But I'm still going to spill my share of blood
This little games a little old
A little late I've sold my soul
A martyr but I'm not the only one
Family don't mean shit to me
The wind has blown away the seed
Got a father but I've never been a son
We live to die all for one
Lean on each other to carry on
My metal family 'til the day I'm done
I'm exposed
X X
Heart open wide
X X
So mark the X on me
Stab your horns into my eyes
Bear my soul
X X
Transparent life
X X
So mark the X on me
Stab your spears into my side
Say what you want
Write what you want
But we stand proud on this stage
We're built to mosh
We're built to slam
We're built to fucking rage
Born and bred a metal head and that's the end of this
And if you've got a problem sorry but I don't give a shit
I'm exposed
X X
Heart open wide
X X
So mark the X on me
Stab your horns into my eyes
Bear my soul
X X
Transparent life
X X
So mark the X on me
Stab your spears into my side
Mark the X
Mark the X
Mark the X
Mark the X
Stab your spears into my side
X X
Stab your spears into my side
X X
Stab your spears
X X
Into my side
X X
