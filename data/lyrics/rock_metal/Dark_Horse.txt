True dedication most just do not possess
When push becomes shove, can you rise above the rest?
Waves of words, they fall short and crash at my feet
Such are the ways of the weak
I'm not scared! It's all that I know
Done nothing but travel without knowing where to go
I've been digging up bones
Remnants of what made up me I've never shown
This is my time to rise
Dark horse. I'll fight my way to the top
You will never be the thorn in my side
Dark horse. Dreams are my driving force
Open your eyes. Go live your own life
I'm not scared! It's all that I know
Done nothing but travel without knowing where to go
I've been digging up bones
Remnants of what made up me I've never shown
When the smoke clears, and the damage is done
I'll be the only one left standing
I see someone without a shred of hope
At their breaking point. At the end of the rope
I'm not scared! It's all that I know
Done nothing but travel without knowing where to go
I've been digging up bones
Remnants of what made up me I'll never show
I'm not scared! It's all that I know
Done nothing but travel without knowing where to go
I've been digging up bones
