Get your mind out the gutter babe
You laugh when I stutter babe
You think you'd do so much better
I ain't buyin' that
You hold me back when I'm walkin'
You do all my talkin'
Like you're the only one that matters
I won't stand for that
You say you got the touch
I think you talk too much
'Cause I swear I make you blush
But I won't get flattered cause it doesn't even matter
You think you know so much
But I think you're out of touch
I don't wanna make bets with you
Take your money with you honey find someone new
You always act like your leaving
I find it hard to believe
That you'd be anything
Without me
You're as pretty as the stars
But you try too hard
You always shoot for the moon
But end up right back where you started
You say you got the touch
I think you talk too much
'Cause I swear I make you blush
But I won't get flattered cause it doesn't even matter
You think you know so much
But I think you're out of touch
I don't wanna be next to you
'Cause I can't stand a single thing you do
You make me feel like a fool
And I hate living by your rules
I got everything a man could ever need
You hold me back when I'm walkin'
You do all my talkin'
Like you're the only one that matters
I won't stand for that
You say you got the touch
I think you talk too much
'Cause I swear I make you blush
But I won't get flattered cause it doesn't even matter
You think you know so much
But I think you're out of touch
I don't wanna be next to you
'Cause I can't stand a single thing you do
You say you got the touch
I think you talk too much
'Cause I swear I make you blush
But I won't get flattered cause it doesn't even matter
You think you know so much
But I think you're out of touch
I don't wanna make bets with you
Take your money with you honey find someone new
