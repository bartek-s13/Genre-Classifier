<<<<<<< HEAD
I believe, I believe, I believe in you
I believe, I believe, I believe in you
I took a chance on a dance with a lady so true
'Cause I believe, I believe in a lady like you
I know you're not an easy one to conquer
May I remind you girl that I'm a monster
And if I may suggest we move it closer
Just put your hands in mine like you're supposed to
The way she slithers on the dance floor, criminal
So I'll be careful 'bout my first step, pivotal
And they're watching from the sidelines, visual
So let's leave 'em with some highlights (Yeah)
So I just bob my head right through the bass line
If she was someone else it wouldn't take time
She said don't fall in love without a head start
I said well find me love cause that's the hard part
Da da da da, da-da-da-da-da
Da da da da, da-da-da-da-da
Da da da da, da-da-da-da-da
Da da da da, da-da-da-da-da
Oooh, I think I've found you out
Oooh, I think I've found you out
Oooh you've been spilling your secrets honey
Oooh you've been spilling your secrets honey
I've had enough with you turning your back on me
I think I've found you out
I've had enough with you turning your back on me
I think I've found you out
Oooh you've been spilling your secrets honey, Oooh oh oh
I've had enough with you turning your back on me
Da da da da, da-da-da-da-da
Da da da da, da-da-da-da-da
Da da da da, da-da-da-da-da
