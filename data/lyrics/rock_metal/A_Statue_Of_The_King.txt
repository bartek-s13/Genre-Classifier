<<<<<<< HEAD
On this glorious day we’re all citizens!
By all your warriors' names, we swear diligence!
Lay the first stone we lay at your feet...
...all the world trembles, begs and flees!

Everybody wants one, everybody needs one...
Everybody heard the word, it’s absurd!
Well, no one else can make one!
They don't know how to take one!
But I know that you know!
You know, and I know that...!!
Everybody wants one, everybody needs one...
But they lack proper stone, and rocks, and balls!
So they can all just dream on...
...but we don't wanna share one!
We have worked too hard!
So hard! I'm hard!
Harder than steel is my king’s will!

Adversaries, dignitaries, ladies and gentlemen...
...my beloved citizens!
It is time to ignite the mighty flame...
Of the royal beacon!
And then unveil the statue of our ruler!
We celebrate! We've built... a statue of the king!

Bigger than the last one, bigger than the best one!
Bigger than the dreams we dream to the extreme!
There's nothing to compare to...
No-one could prepare you!
But I know that you know
You know, and I know it's...!!
...bigger than the last one, bigger than the best one!
Made with proper stone, and rocks, and balls!
So you can try to make one...
...'cause we ain’t gonna share one!
We all worked too hard!
So hard! I'm hard!!

Adversaries, dignitaries, ladies and gentlemen...
...my beloved citizens!
It is time to ignite the mighty flame...
Of the royal beacon!
