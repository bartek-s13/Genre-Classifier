Love is blindness, I don't want to see
Won't you wrap the night around me?
Oh, my heart, love is blindness

I'm in a parked car, on a crowded street
You see your love made complete
Thread is ripping, the knot is slipping
Love is blindness

Love is clockworks and cold steel
Fingers too numb to feel
Squeeze the handle, blow out the candle
Love is blindness

Love is blindness, I don't want to see
Won't you wrap the night around me?
Oh, my love
Blindness

A little death without mourning
No call and no warning
Baby, a dangerous idea
That almost makes sense
Love is drowning in a deep well
All the secrets, and nobody else to tell
Take the money
Why don't you honey?
Blindness

Love is blindness
I'm so sick of it, I don't want to see
Why don't you just take the night
Wrap it all around me?
Oh, my love
Blindness
Love is blindness
Oh, I'm too numb to feel
Blow out the candles
