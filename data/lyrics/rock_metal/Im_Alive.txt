Aaaaah!

The light in the tunnel
Was a not coming train
I was under the rubble
But I'm back again

Did you miss me baby?
Here I am
Did you miss me baby?
I'm your man

I climb back up from the bottom of the stairs
They're dancing on my grave but I'm not not in there
Oh where, oh where could our little friends be?
You open your eyes then you look right at me

So did you miss me boys and girls?
I crawled out of the underworld
And I知 alive!
I知 alive!

Thought I was six feet under
Dead and gone
They thought I was sober
But I switched back on

Did you miss me baby?
Here I am
Did you miss me baby?
I'm your man

I climb back up from the bottom of the stairs
They're dancing on my grave but I'm not not in there
Oh where, oh where could our little friends be?
You open your eyes then you look right at me

So did you miss me boys and girls?
I crawled out of the underworld
And I知 alive!
I知 alive!

I知 alive!
I知 alive!
Yeah I知 alive!
