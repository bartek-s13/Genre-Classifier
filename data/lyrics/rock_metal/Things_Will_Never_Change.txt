Oh, oh, I didn't want to wear another mask
For another day, for another task
I've been treating you bad, yeah I know
It's time to change it, time to grow
I'm gonna let you in, play video games
Gon' let you win and act ashamed
We're gonna have a good time
We're gonna have a good time, yeah
I didn't know I could change this story
Am I the reason why nothing will ever change?
Are you the girl who just stood before me?
Am I the shadow of me from yesterday?
You didn't know you just killed my glory
I didn't realize things will never change
But things will never change
Oh, oh, you should've let me go
I should just drive away
Without looking back
Without a thing to say
But you are on my mind simply everyday
I'm like a fish in the pond
The one you could betray
It doesn't make any sense
You don't seem to care
About what we had, it isn't fair
I know you're still the good kind
I know you're still the good kind
I didn't know I could change this story
Am I the reason why nothing will ever change?
Are you the girl who just stood before me?
Am I the shadow of me from yesterday?
You didn't know you just killed my glory
I didn't realize things will never change
But things will never change
So I blow out the candle
The fire puts me in control
I know I told you awhile ago
And I hate to say, "I told you so"
But did the time just run out?
Did the time just run out?
Did the time just run out?
I think our time just ran out
Just ran out, yeah
I didn't know I could change this story
Am I the reason why nothing will ever change?
Are you the girl who just stood before me?
Am I the shadow of me from yesterday?
You didn't know you just killed my glory
I didn't realize things will never change
