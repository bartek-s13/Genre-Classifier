Hey Mister, where have you been?
I'll never get to live this life again
I gave it all but you were never there
I gave it all but did you really ever care
I hope where you are is a home for you
Because I never found mine
While I was always looking for you
Hey Mister, where have you been?
I'll never get to live this life again
Hey! Live it up

Where are you this time?
You never showed, I'll never know
How could you just let me go
I'm all alone but you can't feel that
Look at me now, now I've become
Become the man you will never know!

This is the anthem for all you cowards!
This is the anthem for all you cowards!
Cowards!
Hey Mister, where have you been?
I'll never get to live this life again
I just don't see it eye to eye anymore
You were too much for me to ignore
This search has been full of so many tears
That flooded the future I saw, discovering you
Hey Mister, where have you been?
I'll never get to live this life again
Hey! Live it up
Where are you this time?
You never showed, I'll never know
How could you just let me go
I'm all alone but you can't feel that
Look at me now, now I've become
Become the man you will never know!

This is what I got
I don't need you anymore!
This is what I got
I don't need you anymore!
This is what I got
I don't need you anymore!
This is what I got
