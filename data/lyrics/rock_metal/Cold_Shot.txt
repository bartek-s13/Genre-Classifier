Once was a sweet thing, baby
Held that love in our hands
But now I reach to kiss your lips
It just don't mean a thing

And that's a cold shot, baby
Yeah that's a drag
A cold shot, baby
I've let our love go bad

Remember the way that you loved me
Do anything I say
Now I see you out somewhere
You won't give me the time of day

And that's a cold shot, oh
Yeah that's a drag
That's a cold shot, baby
We'd better learn from that

I really meant I was sorry
For ever causing you pain
You showed your appreciation
By walking out anyway
And that's a cold shot, baby
Yeah that's a drag
That's a cold shot, baby
We'd better learn from that

So sad
Too bad
So sad
