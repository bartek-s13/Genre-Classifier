Where is your heart? Can we beat this if we all
Tear the borders, break the walls, together as one?
The cruel hand of a faithless destiny that never sleeps (Oh, oh-oh)
The guiltless restraints assured by deceit (Oh, oh-oh)
Are we free? (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Are we all alone? (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)

If you gonna accuse me of pourin' too much salt in the wound
We have just proved that they can pollute our heads with the news
They will manipulate the masses again
If you gonna accuse me of tellin' you what you already knew
It's the same song sung with a different truth
And all of us forget it 'cause our head's inside the noose
They will manipulate the masses again
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we won't forget it
You better pray for absolution
You can change but you can't deny
The new wave in a terror nation
Why do we ignore the warning signs?
Board it up, the borders are shut
The blood of the innocent is under the rug
White lies in a world corrupt
Are we too blind to see through honest eyes?
War will cease when we refuse to fight
Where is your heart? Can we beat this if we all
Tear the borders, break the walls, together as one?
The cruel hand of a faithless destiny that never sleeps (Oh, oh-oh)
The guiltless restraints assured by deceit (Oh, oh-oh)
Are we free? (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Are we all alone? (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Are we all alone?

Hope widows, shattered windows
Restriction without effect
Deadlines in silhouettes
Why do we ignore the warning signs?
Cold calls to derelict homes
Needles at the side of the road
Wires and liars like thorns that won't let go
Are we too blind to see through honest eyes?
War will cease when we refuse to fight
Tell me, where is your heart?

I think the silence speaks volumes
Now, we march to our own drums
They're only singing what they want to be sung
Hate's become the new anthem
How could you?
When did our veins run numb?
We treat our species like a fuckin' flood
Hate's becomin' our new anthem
The longer I live, I learn that we don't belong
We've taken more than we can give
And you'd do better on your own
The longer I live, I learn that we don't belong
We've taken more than we can give
And you'd do better, better on your own
Are we all alone?

Tear the borders, break the walls, take us back to when we're all
Together as one, taught to love, born to live and let go
Tear the borders, break the walls, take us back to when we're all
Together as one, taught to love, born to live and let go
