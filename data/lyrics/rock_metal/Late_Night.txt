Oh, I hoped that you were somebody
Someone I could count
To pull me to my feet again
When I was in doubt
Oh now, Mama, do you hear me
Calling out your name?
Oh now Mama do you hear me
I'm calling out your name?
I'm calling out your name
And I'm the last cowboy in this town
Empty veins and my plastic broken crown
They said I swam the sea that ran aground
They said I once was lost but now I'm truly found
And I know the place but not the way
I feel, I feel no shame
Oh now, Mama, do you hear my fear?
It's coming after me
Calling out your name
Calling out your name
Stay with me
Stay with me
But you threw your heart away
Boy, I know just what I say
Tho the phone cut in the way
Being still downtown, I say
And I know you ran away,
Oh, I know but I'm feeling OK
Now I found love, the feeling won't go
Now I found love, the feeling won't go
See you walk away
Feeling okay now
Happy now?
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
