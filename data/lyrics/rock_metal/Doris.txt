It crushes me to know she's ignored
Throw up, hang up, this one is for no one
Show me how it is inside
Show who I am this time

To give
To let you
Either way this blood will rot
To be, just be
The blood is draining through my eyes

To be with someone's lover, my bad
You know it, I threw up
My little, my trash, my lover
Show me how it is inside
Show who I am this time

Too good
To let you
Either way this blood will rot
To be, just be
The blood is draining through my eyes

Fear, fear!
They'll shoot me with this not right fear, fear
This earth and world is not enough, fear

To be, just be
To care, do you care?
To be, just be
The blood is draining through my eyes

Never be it, never be, never be, never be, never be, never
