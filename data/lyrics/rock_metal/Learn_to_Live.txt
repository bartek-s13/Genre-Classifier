Slave away, it's just another day
It's just another day without meaning
Blue to gray, another bill to pay
Until you die under a glass ceiling
Gas prices rise
We numb our feelings
Monetized and bipolarized
By the drugs that they've been dealing

Staring awake at the ceiling
You promised never to forgive
Tearing apart at the seams, baby
You better learn to fucking live

Because this world don't give a shit

Run the track and fucking play it back
And ask yourself where you stopped believing
Look inside, you can no longer hide
The discontentment that you've been feeling
There's so much more
This life can hold
If you ignored the fucking broken record
Of a dream you've bought and sold
Staring awake at the ceiling
You promised never to forgive
Tearing apart at the seams, baby
You better learn to fucking
Staring awake at the ceiling
You promised never to forgive
Tearing apart at the seams, baby
You better learn to fucking live

Staring awake at the ceiling
You promised never to forgive
Tearing apart at the seams, baby
You better learn to fucking
Staring awake at the ceiling
You promised never to forgive
Tearing apart at the seams, baby
You better learn to fucking

You better learn to fucking live
You better learn to fucking live
You better learn to fucking live
Because this world don't give a shit
