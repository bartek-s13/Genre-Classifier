<<<<<<< HEAD
They're walking by the night
The moon has frozen blue
Long black coats a shelter for the rain
Their load must get through
Now bats are leaving their trees
They're joining the call
Seven satanic Hell preachers
Heading for the hall
Bringing the blood of a newborn child
Got to succeed, if not it's Satan's fall

Home... come home
Evil messengers with blood stained wings
Home... come home
Home... come home
Is it Satan's fall?
No... It's Satan's call

Craniums high on stakes
It's Satan's epigraph
Something you can't erase... 666
Craniums high on stakes
It's Satan's epigraph
Something you can't erase... 666
They call him the beast

Use your demon eyes, uncover the disguise
Time is out.. Yeah, I don't need your god
Oh the law of Satan
Pray and obey it forever
Oh the law of Satan

Innocent lovers... it's a lie

Iron fists won't do no good against the evil eyes
Of seven holy Hell preachers, don't you even try
Now they cross the river Styx and see the castle rise
So high

Waiting on the other shore for Charon to arrive
A shape with horns and glowing eyes, Satan's still alive
He receives the sacrifice with evil laughs and pride
You better escape, you've got to escape
