<<<<<<< HEAD
I never cared about the money, never really needed fame
You think it would've changed me but I've always been the same
My label tried to sue me, TMZ tried to screw me,
Blabbermouth can fuckin' suck it 'cause they never fuckin' knew me!
Everybody seems like they're waiting for me to die
Talk shit behind my back, can't look me in the eye!
They say I'm overrated, that I should've already faded;
Give a shit about it all because I love to be so hated

All in all it's a good life; I got what I want
I can't complain (I can't complain)
I'm living the good life, a toast to you now
It's all sham pain (It's all sham pain)

I barely get to eat and when I finally get to sleep
I get drug out of bed for another meet-and-greet
I shake the hand of every fan, put on a happy face;
Spread so fuckin' thin I'm all over the place
I hate riding on the bus, I hate flying in the planes;
Sedate myself just to kill the pain
I have no life, forgot the hope;
The whole thing's turned into one big joke
All in all it's a good life; I got what I want
I can't complain (I can't complain)
I'm living the good life, a toast to you now
It's all sham pain (It's all sham pain)

I mean no disrespect, but I ain't picking up the check
Takin' selfies on your phone while you're breathing down my neck
Is getting pretty fuckin' old, and I'm almost nearly done;
I'm glad that you were happier when I was number one

I'm living the good life, a toast to you now
It's all sham pain

All in all it's a good life; I got what I want
I can't complain (I can't complain)
I'm living the good life, a toast to you now
