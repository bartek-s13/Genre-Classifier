This disease is killing me
I can fake somebody else but I cannot fake me
Like a noose around my neck, that's breaking my breath
Before I get down, get down on my knees
There's something wrong in me
I thought I knew what was inside of my head

Hell contends my soul
I'm not on my own, demons take over me
Take my hand and drag me out of this

I need to break out, I need to break
From my cage made of my own bones
It's something I sure can't control
Now let me pretend it's all okay
Even when nothing goes in the right way
I'm waiting for you to admit
There's something wrong in me
(Something, it's taking over)

Hell contends my soul
I'm not on my own, demons take over me
Take my hand and drag me out of this
I cannot withstand
Please drag me out, out of this
Day by day, I'm faking it's all okay
Now tell me what the fuck is wrong with me
Break me down within and set me free

Hell contends my soul
I'm not on my own, demons take over me
Take my hand and drag me out of this
I cannot withstand
