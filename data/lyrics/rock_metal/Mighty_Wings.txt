<<<<<<< HEAD
It's just a ball of dust underneath my feet
It rolls around the sun
It doesn't mean that much to me
Take a chance on the edge of life
Just like all the rest
I look inside and dig it out
Cause there's no points for second best

There's a raging fire in my heart tonight
Growing higher and higher in my soul
Lord!
There's a raging fire in the sky tonight
I wanna ride on the silver dome
Far into the night
Till I make you take me
On your mighty wings
Make you take me
On your mighty wings across the sky
Take me on your mighty wings
Take me on your mighty wings tonight

With just a little luck
A little cold blue steel
I cut the night like a razer blade
Till I feel the way I wanna feel

Oh, I wanna make you
Take me on your mighty wings
Make you take me
On your mighty wings across the sky
Take me on out on your mighty wings
Take me on your mighty wings tonight
On your mighty wings
Make you take me
