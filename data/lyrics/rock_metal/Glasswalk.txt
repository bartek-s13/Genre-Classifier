I’ve seen the light at the end of the walk
These steps lead through the dark
Here now I stand, this chance in hand, to be the only one to hold on to, follow you
In the fear I am shrouded
Consumed Its suffocating me
Its only you, that can get us through
Is this the only chance to start new?
At the end of it all, once the roof begins to fall, will we then know what we were meant to be? Or are we fated to pace the hall?
Broken glass at our feet, we are forced to our knees
I’ve seen the light at the end of the walk
These steps lead through the dark
Here now I stand, this chance in hand, to be the only one to hold on to, follow you
It’s never ending, Theres no escaping it
Breathe in, breathe out, and make the memory
Its never ending, theres no avoiding it
Breathe in, breath out, and make the memory
Im not sure if I’m willing or able, to reach the door that so many pray for
A constant battle with the fear of falling
My eyes are open to a world thats calling
I’ve seen the light at the end of the walk
These steps lead through the dark
Here now I stand, this chance in hand, to be the only one to hold on to, follow you
I know it feels like hell, to gain the strength to walk again
Here now I stand, this chance in hand, to be the only one to hold on to, follow you
Take a step, Make the move, ask yourself
What the fuck have you got to lose
I’ve seen the light at the end of the walk
These steps lead through the dark
Here now I stand, this chance in hand, to be the only one to hold on to, follow you
I know it feels like hell, to gain the strength to walk again
Here now I stand, this chance in hand, to be the only one to hold on to, follow you
