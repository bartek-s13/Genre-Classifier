First time I felt alive
I heard her voice and I knew her pain and strife
I roamed alone, death by my side
Nothing seemed right 'til you came into my life
I grabbed a hold to learn and grow
It was destined that you and I collide
My everything, my sacrifice
And I'll defend you 'til the day I die
Keepers of the faith
I will defend your name
Only true believers remain
The blood, the sweat we gave
Through all my joys and pains
You can't deny the keepers of the faith
I reach for you in troubled times
You spoke to me and made everything alright
I live through you, I'm by your side
It's safe to say that you truly saved my life
Keepers of the faith
I will defend your name
Only true believers remain
The blood, the sweat we gave
Through all my joys and pains
You can't deny the keepers of the faith
I live through you, I'm by your side
It's safe to say that you truly saved my life
I live through you, I'm by your side
It's safe to say that you truly saved my life
My everything, my sacrifice
And I'll defend you until the day I fucking die
Keepers of the faith
I will defend your name
Only true believers remain
The blood, the sweat we gave
Through all my joys and pains
You can't deny the keepers of the faith
Keepers of the faith
Only true believers remain
All the blood, the sweat we gave
You can't deny we're the keepers of the faith
