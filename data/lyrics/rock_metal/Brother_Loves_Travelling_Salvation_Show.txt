Hot August night
And the leaves hanging down
And the grass on the ground smellin' sweet
Move up the road to the outside of town
And the sound of that good gospel beat
Sits a ragged tent
Where there ain't no trees
And that gospel group tellin' you and me

It's Love, Brother Love, say
Brother Love's Traveling Salvation Show
Pack up the babies and grab the old ladies
And ev'ryone goes, 'cause everyone knows
Brother Love's show

Room gets suddenly still
And when you'd almost bet
You could hear yourself sweat, he walks in
Eyes black as coal
And when he lifts his face
Ev'ry ear in the place is on him
Starting soft and slow
Like a small earthquake
And when he lets go
Half the valley shakes
It's Love, Brother Love, say
Brother Love's Traveling Salvation Show
Pack up the babies and grab the old ladies
And ev'ryone goes, 'cause everyone knows
'Bout Brother Love's show

Brothers
I said, brothers
Now you got yourself two good hands
And when your brother is troubled, you gotta reach out your one hand for him
‘Cause that’s what it’s there for
And when your heart is troubled, you gotta reach out your other hand
Reach it out to the man up there
‘Cause that’s what He is there for

Take my hand in yours
Walk with me this day
In my heart I know I will never stray
Halle, halle, halle, halle
Halle, halle, halle, halle

It's Love, Brother Love, say
Brother Love's Traveling Salvation Show
Pack up the babies
And grab the old ladies and ev'ryone goes
I say, Love, Brother Love, say
Brother Love's Traveling Salvation Show
Pack up the babies
And grab the old ladies and ev'ryone goes...
Love, Brother Love, say
Brother Love's Traveling Salvation Show
