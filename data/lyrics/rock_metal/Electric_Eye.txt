Up here in space, I知 looking down on you
My lasers trace everything you do
You think you致e private lives, think nothing of the kind
There is no true escape, I知 watching all the time

I知 made of metal
My circuits gleam
I am perpetual
I keep the country clean

I知 elected electric spy
I知 protected electric eye

Always in focus, you can稚 feel my stare
I zoom into you, but you don稚 know I知 there
I take a pride in probing all your secret moves
My tearless retina takes pictures that can prove

I知 made of metal
My circuits gleam
I am perpetual
I keep the country clean
I知 elected electric spy
I知 protected electric eye


Electric eye, in the sky
Feel my stare, always there
There痴 nothing you can do about it
Develop and expose
I feed upon your every thought
And so my power grows

I知 made of metal
My circuits gleam
I am perpetual
I keep the country clean

I知 elected electric spy
I知 protected electric eye
I'm elected electric spy
