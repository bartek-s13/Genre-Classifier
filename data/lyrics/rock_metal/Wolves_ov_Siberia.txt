Enthrone thyself, O Archuman
O how thou shineth in the realm above
As planets rumble when thou descended upon this globe
To walk this Earth like a shimmering god
Let it be forever heard
We lost our Eden to own the world
Let it be forever known
We lost our battle to win the war
Come all ye, Wolves ov Siberia
We hail the flame, we hail the ice
Beyond bosom, beyond materia
We reject! We fucking deny!
Let it be forever heard
From Slave to king, from king to man
Let it be eternally known
