You know the words to every song I wrote
Front row at every single gig I go
Looking for a better place to call home
No, no, no that ain't home
You strut up to me
Place my hand upon your jeans
I'm so close you can feel the heat
Then you whisper in my ear
You know what I want to hear
You know that I'm all yours tonight

You know what I want to hear
You know what I want to hear
Piece by piece
You know what I want to hear
You know what I want to hear
Piece by piece

You say "baby, buy me these"
I say "baby maybe if you say please"
I don't know if you're here
For you, for you and me
You say "help me", what's wrong?
There's more to me than my songs
I'm surprised that it took this long
Now you're nowhere to be seen
Despite all the begs and pleads
You don't know what life you want to lead

You know what I want to hear
You know what I want to hear
Piece by piece
You know what I want to hear
You know what I want to hear
Piece by piece
You know what I want to hear
You know what I want to hear
Piece by piece
You know what I want to hear
You know what I want to hear
Piece by piece
You know what I want to hear
You know what I want to hear
Piece by piece
You know what I want to hear
You know what I want to hear
Piece by piece
