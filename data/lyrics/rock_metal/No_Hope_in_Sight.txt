No hope in sight
Daylight before them dies
Enshrined the horrified
No hope in sight

Have I prayed
As a slave of lasting cry's
To obey
To sedate as humour dies
Cold embrace
Is the saviour in disguise
Through old age
Only danger never dies
Never dies

It's a battle
As the years start to fade
It's a battle
As the years start to fade

No hope in sight
A light before us dies
Aligned the horrified
No hope in sight

You'll face your fears
Through faded years

It's a battle
As the years start to fade
It's a battle
As the years start to fade

No hope in sight
Daylight before them dies
Enshrined the horrified
