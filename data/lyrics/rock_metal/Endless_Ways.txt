Hold on, hold on for dear life
And run, and run all night
For you are loved in endless ways
Stay with me, please believe
I can't be your memory
My world will never be the same
And my heart is never going to regret
For you are loved in endless ways
Are loved in endless ways
Hold on, hold on for dear life
And run, and run all night
For you are loved in endless ways
Are loved in endless ways
There痴 no way of knowing
What could be waiting
There痴 no way of knowing
The dream I知 creating
There痴 no way of knowing
The dream I知 creating
