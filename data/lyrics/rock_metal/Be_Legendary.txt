Pull the trigger, ride the bull
And cut the cord wrapped around your neck
Hanging by threads
Hands bleeding
Edge of glory, write your story
Seize the moment, no regrets
Our name in stone, forever more
We want more
We want more
We want more
It's our time to shoot the stars
We ain't gonna stop till the world is ours
It's landslide, rocks below
Ready to rise, ready to roll
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Down in history
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Be legendary
Be legendary
Be legendary
Take the power, scold the doubters
They don't know how we roll
Keep an eye out, watch your back now
We're coming for the crown
More
We want more
We want more
We want more
It's our time to shoot the stars
We ain't gonna stop till the world is ours
It's landslide, rocks below
Ready to rise, ready to roll
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Down in history
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Be legendary
Be legendary
Be legendary
It's our time to shoot the stars
We ain't gonna stop till the world is ours
It's landslide, rocks below
Ready to rise, ready to roll
It's our time to shoot the stars
We ain't gonna stop till the world is ours
It's landslide, rocks below
Ready to rise, ready to roll
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Down in history
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Be legendary
Be legendary
Be legendary
Let's be legendary
Be legendary
