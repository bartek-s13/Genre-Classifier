Do you believe in love?
Do you believe in destiny?
True love may come
Only once in a thousand lifetimes
I too have loved, they took her from me
I prayed for her soul
I prayed for her peace
When I close my eyes
I see her face, it comforts me
When I close my eyes
Memories cut like a knife
The blood is the life
And Christ I defy
My sworn enemy, birth of a new creed
Is this my reward
For serving God's own war?
The blood I've spilled up
For faith fulfilled
To damn her, a disgrace
You spit back in my face
I served you loyally
And you spew blasphemy
I avenge with darkness
The blood is the life
The Order of the Dragon
I feed on human life
There are far worse things
Awaiting man than death
Come taste what I have seen
I'm spreading my disease
I will feed upon His precious child
The human race will bleed
They will serve my need
I avenge with darkness
The blood is the life
The Order of the Dragon
I feed on human life
I am the dragon of blood
The relentless prince of pain
Renouncing God off his throne
My blood is forever stained
For true love I shall avenge
I defy the creed that damned her
I am the dragon of blood
The relentless prince of pain
Renouncing God off his throne
My blood is forever stained
I am the dragon of blood
The relentless prince of pain
Renouncing God off his throne
My blood is forever stained
For true love I shall avenge
