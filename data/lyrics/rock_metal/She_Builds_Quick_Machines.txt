Hold fast, little love
Burn it strong, let it roam
Ice cold desert snow
She built a quick dream
Seems to keep her motor clean
Sunday visits and a wet machine
She's always quick to fight
We'll break her through, tonight

I could feel it when you push right down
I could feel the way they stood their ground

Roll over, right
Keep it through tonight
Right, right
Keep it through tonight
Right in my sight, keep it through tonight
I'll smash right through your spotlight

She ran away to Texas
To keep away the excess
Old ex in Vegas, dope, back taxes
She burnt through inheritance
Danced across America
At the all night sex show, so far from home

I could feel it when you push right down
I could feel the way they stood their ground

Roll over, right
Keep it through the night
Right, right
Keep it through the night
Right in my sight, keep it through the night
I'll smash right through your spotlight

What you give is what you take
What you bleed is what you break
I'll bleed for you
I'd steal for for you
I'd take, I'd take, I'd take, I'd take, I'd take, I'd take, I'd take, I'd take

I could feel it when ya push straight down
I could feel the way they stood the ground

Roll over, right
Keep it through the night
Right, right
Keep it through the night
Right in my sight, keep it through the night
