There's a lit cigarette
In the hand of my new angel
She's blowing smoke like halos
And now everybody wants her
But I shouldn't even bother
Because you made me so complete dear
But you left me so alone here
Hang a noose for my new sinner somewhere everyone can see you

Won't you beg me and then tell me how to love you
Like anybody else would
I know you're risking failure (risking failure)
Go run for cover (for how long)
You better start to love her so much you're movin' on and on

Now there's a whole wide world, that wants to know
Have cheap hotels lost their turn-on? She's bathing in the neon
And she's polluting all the airways while I'm passed out in the hallway
And you left me so in love here, and you left with so much hate dear
Was I creating only chaos? This world lives just fine without us

Won't you beg me and then tell me how to love you
Like anybody else would
I know you're risking failure (risking failure)
Go run for cover (for how long)
You better start to love her so much you're movin' on and on

Will it change your life, if I change my mind?
When she's lit the whole wide world
I want to know, if you will

Beg me and then tell me how to love you
Like anybody else would
I know you're risking failure (risking failure)
But I'd hope you set your levels (for how long)
So you can run for cover
You better start to love her
Now are we this pathetic?
You made me finally see it
(Will it change your life when I change my mind?)
Go run for cover
(Will it change your mind when I change my life?)
You better fucking love her so much you're moving on
I'm so pathetic, you made me finally see it
Got what you want? I'm gone

For how long?
For how long?
(For how long?)
For how long?
(For how long now?)
Will it change your life?
