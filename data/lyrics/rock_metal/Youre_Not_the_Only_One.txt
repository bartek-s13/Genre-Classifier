Wallow in the mire and then you're at the pinnacle
The fabricated smiles so wide that it hurts
Your composure is so brittle, and you hold yourself so well
Inside, you cling to pieces of a broken carousel
Tonight, these streets are heaving with young hearts on the chase
We'll have this place on lockdown, it's here for you to taste

The night is ours
You're wide awake, and I'm the same
Darling, you're not the only one
Oh, wide awake, and I'm the same
Darling, you're not the only one
Only one, only one

Maybe we were born and raised too cynical
In the wake of a miracle, we'd never believe
You impersonate the seasons, your gold autumnal haze
But something dies inside you when winter rears its face
Tonight, these streets are heaving with young hearts on the chase
We'll have this place on lockdown, it's here for you to taste

The night is ours
You're wide awake, and I'm the same
Darling, you're not the only one
Oh, wide awake, and I'm the same
Darling, you're not the only one
Only one, only one
