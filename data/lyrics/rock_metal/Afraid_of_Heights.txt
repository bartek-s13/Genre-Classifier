Wherever I go, wherever I go
I have to question the hand that I hold close
Wherever I go, wherever I go
I have to silence the words that you fear most
Don't ever let go, don't ever let go
Are we destined to hit the ground below?
Don't ever let go, don't ever let go
We're at the end of a burning tightrope

Now I'm waiting on the corner in the back of your mind
It's a lonely place to live, and I got nowhere to hide
Cause you told me that you'd never be afraid of heights again
Nobody ever thought that we could make it this high
You're the only one I'd follow 'til the end of time
If we fall, we fall together baby, don't think twice again

Together I know, together I know
That we'd burn like a rocket's afterglow
Together I know, together I know
We could conquer the stars beyond this world
We let it all go, we let it all go
I'm just a voice on a broken radio
We let it all go, we let it all go
We got lost in the constellations
Now I'm waiting on the corner in the back of your mind
It's a lonely place to live, and I got nowhere to hide
Cause you told me that you'd never be afraid of heights again
Nobody ever thought that we could make it this high
You're the only one I'd follow 'til the end of time
If we fall, we fall together baby, don't think twice again
(Don't think twice again again )

And after all of these years, and all of this time
Darling, if I'm still a question in your mind
Well just say the words and this will end
Yeah!

You told me that you'd never be afraid of heights
You told me that you'd never be afraid of heights
You told me that you'd never be afraid of heights again
You told me that you'd never be afraid of heights
You told me that you'd never be afraid of heights
If we fall, we fall together baby, don't think twice again

Wherever I go, wherever I go
I hear your voice on a broken radio
Wherever I go, wherever I go
I know we'll burn like a rocket's afterglow
Don't ever let go, don't ever let go
So are we destined to hit the ground below?
Don't ever let go, don't ever let go
