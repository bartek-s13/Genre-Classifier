<<<<<<< HEAD
I woke up this morning in a panic
I had my red dress on again
Last night I came out, I was so damn manic
I don't even know where I went wrong
But I went wrong

And it's times like these that I swear to God
I'm glad my mother can't see me and if she did
I don't know how I would keep it together
I don't know how I would keep it
It's the rush, it's the lust, you can't trust
It's the rush, it's the lust, you can't trust

There's something to be said about the power of persuasion
It's a fine line just waiting to be crossed
Between what's right, what's wrong, what really turns you on
What makes your heart beat faster
You're headed for a beautiful disaster

Times like these that I swear to God
I'm glad my mother can't see me and if she did
I don't know how I would keep it together
I don't know how I would keep it
And it's times like these that I learn to forget
'Cause it's easier than to live with regret
I don't know how I would keep it together
I don't know how I would keep it
It's the rush, it's the lust, you can't trust
It's the rush, it's the lust, you can't trust
It's the rush, it's the lust, you can't trust
It's the rush, it's the lust, you can't trust

And it's times like these that I swear to God
I'm glad my mother can't see me and if she did
I don't know how I would keep it together
I don't know how I would keep it
And it's times like these that I learn to forget
'Cause it's easier than to live with regret
I don't know how I could keep it together
I don't know how I could keep it
It's the rush, it's the lust, you can't trust
It's the rush, it's the lust, you can't trust
It's the rush, it's the lust, you can't trust
