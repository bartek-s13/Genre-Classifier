Every time I feel the Spirit
Moving in my heart I will pray
Every time I feel the Spirit
Moving in my heart I will pray

Upon the mountain my Lord spoke (my Lord spoke)
Out of his mouth came fire and smoke (came fire and smoke)
When Jordan's River is chilly and cold
It chills the body, Lord, but not the soul

Every time I feel the Spirit
Moving in my heart I will pray
Every time I feel the Spirit
Moving in my heart I will pray

I looked all around me, and it looked so fine
I asked the Lord if all of it's mine
Jesus Christ, His Lord of all
He's coming again to save us all

Every time I feel the Spirit
Moving in my heart I will pray
Every time I feel the Spirit
Moving in my heart I will pray
Every time I feel the Spirit
Moving in my heart I will pray
Every time I feel the Spirit
