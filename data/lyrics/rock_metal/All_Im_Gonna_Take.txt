Did you ever wonder
If you were gonna break
When you finally hear the power
You've had all you're gonna take
I know when I give in
There ain't nothin left to say
Somethin clicks inside me
And it's graduation day
Everybody learns (everybody learns)
The point of no return
My circuit braid is breaking
My sanity's at stake
I know I've taken all I'm gonna take
Frustrated bodies shakin
Feel like I'm gonna break
I know I've taken all I'm gonna take
Big boss man
In his collar and his tie
Thinks he's got the upper hand
When he turns us loose at night
It can make a man so desperate
When there ain't no money left
But a pistol's always welcome
Like American Express
Everybody learns (everybody learns)
The point of no return
My circuit braid is breaking
My sanity's at stake
I know I've taken all I'm gonna take
Frustrated bodies shakin
Feel like I'm gonna break
I know I've taken all I'm gonna take
My circuit braid is breaking
My sanity's at stake
I know I've taken all I'm gonna take
Frustrated bodies shakin
Feel like I'm gonna break
I know I've taken all I'm gonna take
I know I've taken all I'm gonna take
I know I've taken all I'm gonna take
