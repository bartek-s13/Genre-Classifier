And you can bring me to my knees again
All the times that I could beg you please in vain
All the times that I felt insecure for you
And I leave my burdens at the door

But I'm on the outside, I'm looking in
I can see through you, see your true colors
'Cause inside you're ugly, you're ugly like me
I can see through you, see to the real you

All the times that I felt like this won't end, it's for you
And I taste what I could never have, it was from you
All the times that I've cried
My intentions, full of pride
But I waste more time than anyone

But I'm on the outside, I'm looking in
I can see through you, see your true colors
'Cause inside you're ugly, you're ugly like me
I can see through you, see to the real you

All the times that I've cried
All this wasted, it's all inside
And I feel all this pain
Stuffed it down, it's back again
And I lie here in bed
All alone, I can't mend
But I feel tomorrow will be okay
But I'm on the outside, I'm looking in
I can see through you, see your true colors
'Cause inside you're ugly, you're ugly like me
