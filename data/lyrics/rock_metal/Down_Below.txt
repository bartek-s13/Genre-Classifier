<<<<<<< HEAD
I once saw a girl who had a heart so blue
And she smoked and drank about as much as you
And I was hoping, baby, we'd get out soon
While the night's still young under this waning moon

And I can't think about the way we once were
I can't think about his fingers running through your hair
Or what goes on in my room when I'm not there

Down below, I'll meet you in the river down below

I once saw a girl who looked a lot like you
Her hair was storm cloud black, her eyes were raindrop blue
And all I wanted, baby, was to hold you
Before the Stranger comes under this waning moon

Down below, he'll meet you in the river down below
Down below, he'll meet you in the river down below
Let me take you down

And he'll come to see you in the window of your home
To take you to the river down below
And he'll come to see you in the window of your home
To take you to the river down below
And he'll come to see you in the window of your home
To take you to the river down below

Down below, he'll meet you in the river down below
Down below, he'll meet you in the river down below
