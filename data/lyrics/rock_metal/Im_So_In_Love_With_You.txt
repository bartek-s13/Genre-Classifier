You're the reason I live again
You gave me shelter when I needed a friend
I fell in love with you
I'm so in love with you
And girl you're crazy
You want a man like me
So many others can set you free
I'm in love with you
And thank you showing me my way home
When I'm holding you
I'm so in love with you
I am in love with you
I am in love with you
I'm in love
I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you
I'm so in love holding you
It's all I ever want to do
All I ever want to do
You're the reason I live again
