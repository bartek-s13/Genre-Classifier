Your whole life, "I tried and now I'm getting older"
Your whole life, "I tried and now I’m getting closer"

Tell me what you want, was it enough for you?
Fucking up your life, was it enough for you? No way
Tell me what you want, was it enough for you?
Fucking up your life, was it enough for you? No way

No, it's what you wanted though
Everything you told me, I don't need to know
It’s what you wanna do
Everything you ever could've wanted to do

Don't say it's what you need, I'd say it's what you wanted
Don't say it's what you need, I’d say it’s what you wanted

Your whole life, "I tried and now I'm getting older"
Your whole life, "I tried and now I’m getting closer"

Tell me what you want, was it enough for you?
Fucking up your life, was it enough for you? No way
Tell me what you want, was it enough for you?
Fucking up your life, was it enough for you? No way

Here we go, barely though, I'm not searching for a miracle
Here we go, barely though, I'm not searching for a miracle
Here we go, barely though, I'm not searching for a miracle
Here we go, barely though, I’m not searching for a miracle
