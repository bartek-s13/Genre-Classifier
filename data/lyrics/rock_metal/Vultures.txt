You're narcissistic, self righteous, what is this?
You're even worse than the bullshit you preach
Against so if that's what you call real
...I guess I ain't real but I know your type
And you'd sell your soul for a fucking record deal
A hungry man eats anything you feed em
A rich man buys anything you sell em
A scared man believes anything you fucking tell em
The vultures circle back again and again and again
And yeah I see you tryna cash out
Through your tag lines yeah you were built on
Fake hype and co-signs and now all of a sudden
Running your mouth in public but you ain't from it
You ain't got the heart and you don't got the
Stomach motherfucker!
A hungry man eats anything you feed em
A rich man buys anything you sell em
A scared man believes anything you fucking tell em
The vultures circle back again and again and again
Yeah you're just the asshole
Tryna get paid off all of them 
A hungry man eats anything you feed em
A rich man buys anything you sell em
A scared man believes anything you fucking tell em
The vultures circle back again and again and again
Again and again and again (Hey...Hey...Hey...)
The vultures circle back again and again and again
