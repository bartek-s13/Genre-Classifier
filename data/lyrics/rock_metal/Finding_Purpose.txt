Lay it out on the line exhausted from life
I let go and reflect on all of my thoughts
To fulfill a void to fill a hole in my heart
When I put the past behind me
If I make a mark on life
To see my child born sparked the momentum
To be apart of something more led my direction
I found a purpose found meaning in passion that I’ve had this is why I’m alive to listen and give back
In a short time I’ve had to fill many positions in life
I’ve grown to deal with the stress and adapt
Make a decision on what’s more important and what means most
The good and the bad every moment a lesson learned
Obstacles placed to overcome, the choices I make
What will I face
Finding a balance
Becoming a man
I found a purpose found meaning in passion that I’ve had this is why I’m alive to listen and give back
I’ve grown to communicate how I really feel
We are all given a gift the gift of freedom
To give back to me is what matters to give back to me is what matters most
My mind drifted and ventured to find value
