So it's goodnight
Why don't you take a leap of faith and ask me in
And be temped by the moment
Don't you think it's time
To let imagination dance you from your doubts
So we can fall with abandon
I'll shelter you
In wonder love
Till the midnight skies
Turn blue
But I won't push
I'll leave it up to you
Close your eyes
Can you feel me whisper Closer against your skin
On a bed of velvet roses
With every little touch
My hands could tracer a path Around your heart
Deep and into your secrets
I'll shelter you
In wonder love
Till the midnight skies
Turn blue
But I won't push
I'll leave it up to you
It's only love that is
Crying out
It's in your hands
Tell me baby how do I prove To you somehow
That you should know by now just who I am
Baby, don't be afraid we're Just one more kiss away
Don't waste a perfect moon
But I won't push
I'll leave it up to you
I'll be true to you, Baby
But, I won't push
I'll leave it up to you
Leave it up to you, Ohh, yes I will, Uhhh ...
It's All in your Hands
In your heart
