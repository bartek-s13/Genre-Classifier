I ain't no good
And I live by the wood
They say I ain't bad
I'm the best that I've had
And I know it ain't right
But I'll fight my whole life
Just to prove that I was right
The day it went down
I was out on my pad
Not feeling so bad
I'm a suspect now
I'm a vagabond tramp
Living out on a limb
I live by the woods
They say I ain't bad
I'm the best that I've had
And I know it ain't right
But I'll fight my whole life
Just to prove that I was right

Terrestrial fire ascending from underground
Godspeed divine
So we control the mound
Shape shifter spirits whisper
Guide me through this black sorcery
Flashing teeth
Aggressive tendencies
Cloaked beneath
Silver redeems
Smoking mirrors
Black obsidian
Tell us where to find the marrow

The prophecy will be realized
Lord of the near and the nigh
Possessor of earth and sky

Guard your temple
From destruction
Make sure no one goes inside

The prophecy will be realized
Lord of the near and the nigh
Possessor of earth and sky
It's right in front of me
The throne of maladies
It's right in front of me
