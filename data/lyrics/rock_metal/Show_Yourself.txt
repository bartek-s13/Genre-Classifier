Show yourself
Show yourself
I want to see everything you're made of
Tear it down and rip it out
Shed your skin and float it down the river
Lose yourself
Lose yourself
Wild horses ride you through the valley
Come alive
Come alive
Sail into the void without your worries

You're not as safe as far as I can tell
And I can tell
Only you can save yourself
Soon this will all be a distant memory
Or could this dream be real at all?

Stars align
Stars align
Stars can fall and get you into trouble
Be afraid
Don't be afraid
Speak the ancient wisdom of the desert
You're not as safe as far as I can tell
And I can tell
Only you can save yourself
Soon this will all be a distant memory
Or could this dream be real at all?


Show yourself
Show yourself
I wanna see everything you're made of
Reveal yourself
Reveal yourself
The truth will send a ripple through your body
See your fate
You'll see your fate
Death will come and steal you from the living
Dead and gone
Dead and gone
