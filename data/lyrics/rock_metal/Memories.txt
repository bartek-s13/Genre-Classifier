So this is where it ends, the road we took together
Turn another page, however and forever
We only got one chance, the seconds are fading
Under the moonlight, we're wishing the same thing
I wanna remember, remember this moment
Remember this moment, remember this moment

Tonight, I'm thinking it's time
To burn it all down before the rest of our lives
And it can't last, so never look back
Give me your heart and I will give you my hand

Cause nothing's stopping you and me
From making all these memories
Cause nothing's stopping you and me
From making all these memories

Another line begins, I wonder what comes after
Will we be the same, or be in different chapters?
We only got one chance before it's all over
Under the moonlight I want you to hold on
We're gonna remember, remember this moment
Remember this moment, remember this moment
Tonight, I'm thinking it's time
To burn it all down before the rest of our lives
And it can't last, so never look back
Give me your heart and I will give you my hand

Cause nothing's stopping you and me
From making all these memories
Cause nothing's stopping you and me
From making all these memories

This is it, we're never getting time back
I’ll admit, I’ll always think of what we had
(One last night to remember)
This is it, we're never getting time back
I'll admit, I'll always think of what we had
(Let's take this world together, now)

Tonight, I'm thinking it's time
To burn it all down before the rest of our lives
And it can't last, so never look back
Give me your heart and I will give you my hand
Cause nothing's stopping you and me
From making all these memories
Cause nothing's stopping you and me
From making all these memories

Cause nothing's stopping you and me
(One last night to remember)
Cause nothing's stopping you and me
(Let's take this world together)
