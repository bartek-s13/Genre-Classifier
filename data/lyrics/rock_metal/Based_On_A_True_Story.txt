I'm just a bit scared that's all
Since you never write back and never answer my calls
I'm waiting here by the phone
So let me know if you're alive and well
So I can leave you alone
Yeah, so I can leave you alone
I said I'm just a bit scared that's all
Should I accept my big loss and get ready to fall?
I'm still waiting by the phone
So let me know if you're alive so I can leave you alone
Eli you told me- live as a winner, die as a sinner
I was protecting down and above her, said that I loved her

I'm gonna leave you alone, gonna let you decide
Make up your mind and tell a line after lie
If I leave you alone, will you do me the same?
I hate the game I play again and again
I will leave you alone
I'm gonna leave you alone
I'm gonna leave you alone
Cos I feel so ashamed to be part of a game
I'm ready to take control
For every step that I take I will rely on my soul
And all the titles I know they tried to give to you and me
We blew away and walked out laughing happily
A happy new year given to none but one who walks alone
If I could just erease but a sharp year, instead of eating the bone
I'm gonna leave you alone, gonna let you decide
Make up your mind and tell a line after lie
If I leave you alone, will you do me the same?
I hate the game I play again and again
I will leave you alone
I'm gonna leave you alone
I'm gonna leave you alone
Cos I feel so ashamed to be part of a game
To be part of a game
To be part of a game

You tried to change me didn't you?
You tried to change me didn't you, didn't you?
I tried to stop you didn't I, didn't I?
I guess I didn't now
I guess I didn't
I guess I didn't
I guess I never tried to stop you at all
I'm gonna leave you alone, gonna leave you behind
I made up my mind and tell a line after lie
If I leave you alone, will you do me the same?
I hate the game I play again and again
I will leave you alone
I'm gonna leave you alone
I'm gonna leave you alone
Cos I feel so ashamed to be part of a game
To be part of a game
To be part of a game
