Welcome to the west coast where we at?
We in northern california
Welcome to the west coast
Whatchu bangin'? This is LHHC!

Started this band in 2004 passing demos out at
Shows dropping flyers at the door
Like, "fuck a co-sign I'm gonna get it on my own"
I'm gonna write a couple songs then motherfucker
I'm gone, god damn

So lemme get it on the record...
Never gave a fuck about selling records so my bags
Are packed I got the bay on my back
So when they ask me where I'm at
You know the answer to that, it goes:

Welcome to the west coast where we at?
We in northern california
Welcome to the west coast
Whatchu bangin'? This is LHHC!

Started again 2007 I tried my last reset on a studio session
Nobody else could give a fuck but
Couldn't fuck with my visions so what they're yellin'?
Fuck the one whole world rocking with us
Let's get it

Welcome to the east coast where we at?
We from MLB to NYC
Welcome to the east coast
Whatchu bangin'? This is DNHC

Where we at?
We in northern california
Whatchu bangin'? This is LHHC
Where we at?
We from MLB to NYC
Whatchu bangin'? This is DNHC

Ey yo Rob! Waddup Jay?
Through it all, we stood tall, we made our own way
LHHC!

Now y'all must have forgot I've been here for 13 years
And I still can't stop I said I still won't stop
So, right hand to god you either with us
Or against us
And if not, fuck all of y'all
You either with us
Or against us
And if not, fuck all of y'all
