<<<<<<< HEAD
Bound to your side and trapped in silence
Just a possession
Is the sex or only violence
That feeds your obsession
You send me to a broken state
Where I can take the pain
Just long enough
That I am numb
That I just disappear

So go on and fight me
Go on and scare me to death!
Tell me I asked for it
Tell me I'll never forget!
You could give me anything but love!
Anything but love

Does it feel good tonight
Hurt me with nothing!
Some sort of sick satisfaction
You get from mind fucking
Oh stripped down to my naked core
The darkest corners of my mind are yours
That's where you live
That's where you breathe
So go on and fight me
Go on and scare me to death!
Tell me I love you
Tell me I'll never forget!
You could give me anything but love!
Anything but love!

Without any faith
Without any light!
Can dare me to live
Can dare me to lie!
Inside!, I am dead

So go on and fight me
Go on and scare me to death!
I'll be the victim
You'll be the voice in my head!
You could give me anything but love!
Anything but love

Anything but love
