I'm an alien
Cause I'm not of this world
I have a name
But I've been changed, and now I can't stay the same
And I'm a loser if that means I've been lost before
But now I found it, I'm surrounded
Cause you can hear the way it sounded

Like angels singing with a million voices

The end is where we begin
It's crawling back when
We run away, run away
Cause the end is where we begin
Where broken hearts mend
And start to beat again
The end is where we begin

I'm a monster if that means I'm misunderstood
Cause its alive and I can't hide it
The energy is rising
And I'm a traitor if that means I've turned on myself
I can't deny it, it's like a riot
And I can't keep it quiet

Like angels singing with a million voices

The end is where we begin
It's crawling back when
We run away, run away
Cause the end is where we begin
Where broken hearts mend
And start to beat again
The end is where we begin

Hear me running
Hear me running, running
Hear me running, hear me running, ra-running
Hear me running, hear me

The end is where we begin
It's crawling back when
We run away, run away
Cause the end is where we begin
Where broken hearts mend
And start to beat again
The end is where we begin
It's crawling back when
We run away, run away
Cause the end is where we begin
Where broken hearts mend
And start to beat again
The end is where we begin
