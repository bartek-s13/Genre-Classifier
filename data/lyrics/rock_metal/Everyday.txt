Every day, it's a-getting closer
Going faster than a rollercoaster
Love like yours will surely come my way
A-hey, a-hey-hey

Every day, it's a-getting faster
Everyone said, "Go ahead and ask her"
Love like yours will surely come my way
A-hey, a-hey-hey

Every day seems a little longer
Every way, love's a little stronger
Come what may
Do you ever long for true love from me

Every day, it's a-getting closer
Going faster than a rollercoaster
Love like yours will surely come my way
A-hey, a-hey-hey


Every day seems a little longer
Every way, love's a little stronger
Come what may
Do you ever long for true love from me

Every day, it's a-getting closer
Going faster than a rollercoaster
Love like yours will surely come my way
A-hey, a-hey-hey
