Alone at last we can sit and fight
And I've lost all faith in this blurring light
Stay right here we can change our plight
Storming through this despite what's right

One final fight for this tonight, whoa-oh-oh
With knives and pens, we made our plight

Lay your heart down, the end's in sight
Conscience begs for you to do what's right
Every day it's still the same dull knife
Stab it through and justify your pride

One final fight for this tonight, whoa-oh-oh
With knives and pens we made our plight, whoa-oh-oh

And I can't go on without your love, you lost, you never held on
We tried our best, turn out the light, turn out the light!

One final fight for this tonight, whoa-oh-oh
With knives and pens we made our plight, whoa-oh-oh

And I can't go on without your love, you lost, you never held on
