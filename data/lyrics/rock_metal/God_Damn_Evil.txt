We power up the empty screen
And let the games begin
Far beyond its poisoning
Is a special kind of sin
We open locks
And break the chains
And let the devil in
We're losing all of what remains
In a war we'll never win
In a war we'll never win

God damn Evil
God damn it all
But God save the people
But God damn the walls

Self control is all but gone
The weak time after time
Take the bait and break the bond
But never pay the crime
The only saving grace is love
And we know where that lies
It's what we feel unworthy of
So we don't claim the prize
No, we never claim the prize

God damn Evil
God damn it all
God save the people
But God damn the walls


God damn Evil
God damn it all
God save the people
But God damn the walls
God damn Evil
But God damn the walls, oh yeah yeah
God save the people
Save the people
God damn Evil
God damn Evil, oh yeah yeah
God save the people
God save the people
Oh!
God damn Evil...
