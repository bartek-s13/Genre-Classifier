I don't want you, cook my bread
I don't want you, make my bed
I don't want your money, too
I just wanna make love to you
I don't want you, be no slave
I don't want you, work all day
I don't want you to be sad and blue
I just wanna make love to you
I can tell by the way that you baby talk
I can see by the way that you switch and walk
I can tell by the way that you treat your man
But I could love you, baby, it's a cryin' shame
I don't want you, wash my clothes
I don't want you, keep a home
I don't want you to be true
I just wanna make love to you
I don't want you, be no slave
I don't want you, work all day
I don't want you to be true
I just wanna make love to you
I don't want you, keep a home
I don't want you, wash my clothes
I don't want you to be true
