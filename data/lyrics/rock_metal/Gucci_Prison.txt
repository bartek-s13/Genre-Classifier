They say I'm fucking crazy
Stupid, also lazy
Truth is it don't phase me
'cause bitch I might be
You'll never meet another mother fucker like me
I'll never change who I am
Love it or leave it don't be tripping cause we ain't the same
I'll never change who I am
Talk all the shit but acting different when we face to face
They say I'm fucking worthless
No future and no purpose
Just a damaged person
Yeah bitch I might be
You'll never meet another mother fucker like me
Just another bad seed from a good garden
No good low life with the blade sharpened
Write a check with my mouth and cash it no fronting
So don't be coming around unless you want to start something
Bitch, I'll cut you
Bitch, I'll cut you
Bitch, I'll cut you
Wide open
They say I'm fucking crazy
Stupid, also lazy
Truth is it don't phase me
'cause bitch I might be
You'll never meet another mother fucker like me
Bitch, I'll cut you
Bitch, I'll cut you
Bitch, I'll cut you
Wide open

"What do you see when you look inside yourself"?
"Inside myself? I see everything. I see all: I see the good, the bad, the evil. I see the whole thing"
"How much evil is there"?
"As much as you see."
"What do you see"?
"All of it, hahahaha. Right down to peaks you haven't touched yet. Dreams you haven't dreamed, and worlds you haven't conquered. The mind is endless. You put me in a dark solitary cell, and to you that's the end. To me, it's the beginning, there's a universe in there. There's a world in there... and I'm free"
