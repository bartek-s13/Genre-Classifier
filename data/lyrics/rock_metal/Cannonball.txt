Check check check
One two

Spitting in a wishing well
Blown to hell, crash
I'm the last splash
I know you little libertine
I know you're a real cuckoo

Want you cuckoo cannonball
Want you cuckoo cannonball
In the shade, in the shade
In the shade, in the shade

I know you little libertine
I know you're a cannonball
I'll be your whatever you want
The bong in this reggae song

In the shade
In the shade
Want you cuckoo cannonball
Want you cuckoo cannonball
Spitting in a wishing well
Blown to hell, crash
I'm the last splash
I'll be your whatever you want
The bong in this reggae song

Want you cuckoo cannonball
Want you cuckoo cannonball
In the shade, in the shade
