She's got an ice cold stare and hypnotize
Like a deadly weapon with her eyes
She's got killer lips, talkin' sweet and low
No matter what I did, he still said no...oh no
Rumors flyin' high and low
She says she does and you know she won't
(She)
She'll never satisfy
(She's a tease)
She's gonna leave you dry
(She)
You better take it from me
(She)
She's gonna act so nice
(She's a tease)
So don't think twice
(She)
'Bout takin' my advice
She's a tease
She's like a double shot of sex on ice, calculated to entise
She'll work up your appetite
And then she'll tell you "not tonight"...not tonight?
Rumors flyin' high and low
She says she does and you know she won't
(She)
She'll never satisfy
(She's a tease)
She's gonna leave you dry
(She)
You better take it from me
(She)
She's gonna act so nice
(She's a tease)
So don't think twice
(She)
'Bout takin' my advice
She's a tease
Caviar, cabronet
My credit card, Broadway plays
No matter what I say
She only took me half the way
(Solo)
(She)
She'll never satisfy
(She's a tease)
She's gonna leave you dry
(She)
You better take it from me
(She)
She's gonna act so nice
(She's a tease)
So don't think twice
(She)
'Bout takin' my advice
(She's a tease)
(She)
(She's a tease) That girl's a tease
(She) She'got me down on my knees
Now get the hell out of here you...
