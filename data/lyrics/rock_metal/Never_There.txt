Do you think about me cause I don’t have any doubt
You must in this life
Even though you’re never there, I didn’t feel you disappear
From sight, you did it well

And now you and I share the same life missin' out
And so the story goes
That we’re left, we’re stuck with a broken house
I know that if I
I had the chance, I’d let you know that I understand
I’ve let you go

I don’t need you by my side I think by now I’m doin' fine
Myself, on my own
And I feel you time to time, like you're sending out a sign
I can tell you're not alone

Because you and I share the same life missin' out
And so the story goes
That we’re left, we’re stuck with a broken house
I know that if the
The chance appears I’d have no fears
We both share pain, we feel the same

And now you and I share the same life missin' out
And so the story goes
That we’re left, we’re stuck with a broken house
I know that if I
I had the chance, I’d let you know that I understand
I’ve let you go
You and I share the same life missin' out
So the story goes
That we’re left, we’re stuck with a broken house
I know that if the
The chance appears, well I’d have no fears
We both share pain, we feel the same
