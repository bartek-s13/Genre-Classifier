13 days I slept on the floor while the hospice workers came and I begged for more
The moment we heard the news, my emotions left my body left my body
The loss of a sibling it’s sickening and left me traumatized
No amount of help will end my suffering the constant ache no amount of time will heal these wounds
Sixteen roses on your grave one for every year you changed my life
February 8th won’t be the same laying you down and closing the casket was the hardest thing I’ve done looking back it drained me of all emotions the pain is real just like the guilt I feel to this day every person I knew doesn’t look at me the same to this day those people will never remember your name never remember your name there were times I wished I was you because  then you’d still be here they want their little girl back but cancer took you too soon laying you down and closing the casket was the hardest thing I’ve done looking back it drained me of all emotions that day I was mostly mad at myself for never showing face for never being there all the excuses I made just to avoid those visits the loss of a sibling it’s sickening and left me traumatized
Left you alone too selfish burdened with myself
I was only living for me now you’re gone and I’m living for you
Sixteen roses on your grave
Sixteen roses on your grave one for every year you changed my life I will never be the same Sixteen roses on your grave one for every year you changed my life I will never be the same I will never be alright
Stage three cancer and nothing’s changed a malignancy in your brain
Slipping away
Sitting next to your sibling it’s something I see every time I close my eyes slipping away
