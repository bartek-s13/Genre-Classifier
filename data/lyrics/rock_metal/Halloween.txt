Masquerade, masquerade
Grab your mask and don't be late
Get out well disguised
Heat and fever in the air tonight
Meet the others at the store
Knock on other people's door
Trick or treat, they have no choice
Little ghosts are making lots of noise
But watch out (watch out)
Beware
Listen (listen)
And take care
In the streets on Halloween
There's something going on
No way to escape the power unknown
In the streets on Halloween
The spirits will arise
Make your choice, it's Hell or paradise
It's Halloween
It's Halloween
Tonight
Someone's sitting in a field
Never giving yield
Sitting there with gleaming eyes
Waiting for big pumpkin to arise
Bad luck if you get a stone
Like the good old Charlie Brown
You think Linus could be right
The kids will say it's just a stupid lie
Well, watch out (watch out)
Beware
Listen (listen)
And take care
In the streets on Halloween
There's something going on
No way to escape the power unknown
In the streets on Halloween
The spirits will arise
Make your choice, it's Hell or paradise
It's Halloween
It's Halloween
Tonight
Listen now, we are calling you
Listen now, we are calling you
Listen now, we are calling you
Listen tonight, we are calling you
And there is magic in the air
Magic in the air
Magic in the air
Magic in the air
On Halloween
Black is night, full of fright
You'll be missing day
What will be here very soon?
Changing your way
A knock at your door
Is it real or is it a dream?
On trembling legs you open the door
And you scream on Halloween, on Halloween
Darkness, where am I now?
Is there anybody out there?
What has happened?
Am I in Heaven or is it Hell?
I can see a light come
It's coming nearer, it's shining
It's shines so bright
It's shining on me
I am the one
Doom's in my hands
Now, make your choice
Redeemed or enslaved
I'll show you passion and glory
He is the snake
I'll give you power and abundance
He's the corrupter of man
Save me from the evil one
Give me strength to carry on
I will fight for all mankind
Deliverance and peace of mind
But watch out, watch out, beware
Listen, listen, take care
In the streets on Halloween
There's something going on
No way to escape the power unknown
In the streets on Halloween
The spirits will arise
Make your choice, it's Hell or paradise
It's Halloween
It's Halloween
It's Halloween
It's Halloween
Yeah, it's Halloween
Yeah, it's Halloween
Yeah, it's Halloween
Yeah, it's Halloween
Tonight
