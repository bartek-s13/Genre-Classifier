A glint of steel, a flash of light
You know you're not going home tonight
Be it jack or switch, doctor's or mind
Nowhere to run, everywhere you'll find
You can't escape from the bed you've made
When your time has come, you'll accept the
Blade
You're cornered in the alley way
You know you're all alone
You know it's gonna end this way
The chill goes to the bone
Now here it comes that glistening light
It goes into your side
Blackness comes, tonight's the night
The blade is gonna ride
'Cause you're under the blade, oh
You're under the blade
It's not another party head
This time you cannot rise
Your hands are tied, your legs are strapped
A light shines in your eyes
You faintly see a razor's edge
You open your mouth to cry
You know you can't, it's over now
The blade is gonna ride
'Cause you're under the blade, oh
You're under the blade
A glint of steel, a flash of light
You know you're not going home tonight
Be it jack or switch, doctor's or mind
Nowhere to run, anywhere you'll find
You can't escape from the bed you've made
When your time has come, you'll accept the
Blade
You've tried to make it to the front
But you're pinned against the side
A monster stands before you now
His mouth is open wide
The lights go on, the night explodes
Tears into your mind
When the night does end, you'll come again
The blade is gonna ride
'Cause you're under the blade, oh
You're under the blade
Here it comes, baby
Ah, wah
Oh, you're under it
You're goin' down, down, down, down, down, down
