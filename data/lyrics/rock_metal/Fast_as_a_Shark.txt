<<<<<<< HEAD
Fog in the streets, a church clock beats
Midnight, darkness all around
You better beware, you better take care
Be prepared for the shock
The time has come and he's the one
Who's breathing down your neck
Coming from behind, now it's your time
A loser will die
Fast as a shark, he'll cut out of the dark
He's a killer, he'll rip out your heart
On a one way track and you're not coming back
'Cause the killer's on the attack
Surprise attack, coming from the back
An expert of the deadly knack
Just take care, just beware
Be prepared for the fight
Fast as a shark, he'll cut out of the dark
He's a killer, he'll rip out your heart
On a one way track and you're not coming back
'Cause the killer's on the attack
Watch out, watch out
Fast as a shark, he'll cut out of the dark
He's a killer, he'll rip out your heart
On a one way track and you're not coming back
'Cause the killer's on the attack
Fast as a shark, he'll cut out of the dark
He's a killer, he'll rip out your heart
On a one way track and you're not coming back
'Cause the killer's, 'cause the killer's
'Cause the killer's on the attack, attack, attack
