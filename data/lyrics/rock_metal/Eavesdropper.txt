(1939 in review)

Mic check, is this thing tapped?
‘Cause I can’t say shit without being hacked
Mic check, is this thing tapped?
‘Cause I know they hit record and play it back

Town houses, bugged out
Drop the bomb, smoke them out
Eavesdropper, free thought stopper
In my home, in my phone, in a helicopter
Looking down in the towns with a searchlight
There's a shadow with no sun tonight, alright?
C4 to the door, say hello to your big brother
Now put your hands up motherfucker

There’s a storm about to roll in
Boarded up I’m Edward Snowden
Morse coding
Messages behind the men in black
Bite my lip before i catch a bullet in the back of my head
Narcs sleeping in my bed?
Keeping tabs on everything I said
Hand me over to the feds
Drag me to the chemical sheds
And let my last words be:
"Free speech is dead"
"Free speech is dead"
"Free speech is dead"

Yes, solid
From GCHQ to the NSA
When the tables are turned
Laws are nothing but hearsay
They are subject to the whims of stubborn rulers
Taking a drill to a hard drive ain’t gonna fool us
It’s all uncovered, their shadows are lifted
Through the metadata, and content they're sifting
Ask my boy Orwell what the hell do we do
His fiction pervades the future, for me and you
C4 to the door say hello to your big brother
C4 to the door say hello to your big brother

Now put your hands up you fuck
C4 to the door say hello to your big brother
C4 to the door say hello to your big brother
Now put your hands up you fuck
