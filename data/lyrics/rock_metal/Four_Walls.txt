So when the saints go marching in
They won't be singing for your sins
They just hope to hell you've learnt something living and breathing

Everybody dies with a debt, no silence
Watching death is how we live
Take it or leave it , don't waste your breath
I clear my mind, deny real life
Define here without borders, possessions or enemies

Everybody dies with a debt, we all die for a life that we fear we will only forget
Or confess to a God that we know we only hear in ourselves

Bottle it up, let your problem distill
Forget your dreams or fulfill them
Leave no trace, waste away it's time for change

So when the saints go marching in
They won't be singing for your sins
They just hope to hell you've learnt something living and breathing
Four walls in this prison
But I still can see the river
Four walls in this prison, lies to poison your decisions in life
Take note

(Now you tell me why you’re living a lie)
Don't ignore it, now you know
I saved my soul
I sold it to the open road

I found hope in the wreckage of progress
Trophies shattered and stained (Do what you're told)
There's a mould to be broken
A light burning over your name

And I saved my soul
But I never said I wasn't the culprit
Never said I wasn't deceived (I saved my soul)
Just trying to rewrite the wrongs that were written on me
(I saved my soul)

Everybody dies with a debt, we all die for a life that we fear we will only forget
Or confess to a God that we know we only hear in ourselves
So when the saints go marching in
They won't be singing for your sins
