Lucille, you won't do your sister's will?
Oh, Lucille, you won't do your sister's will?
You ran off and married, but I love you still
Lucille, please, come back where you belong
Lucille, please, come back where you belong
I've been good to you, baby, please, don't leave me alone

I woke up this morning, Lucille was not in sight
I asked my friends about her but all their lips were tight
Lucille, please, come back where you belong
I've been good to you, baby, please, don't leave me alone, whoah


I woke up this morning, Lucille was not in sight
I asked my friends about her but all their lips were tight
Lucille, please, come back where you belong
I've been good to you, baby, please, don't leave me alone

Lucille, baby, satisfy my heart
Lucille, baby, satisfy my heart
