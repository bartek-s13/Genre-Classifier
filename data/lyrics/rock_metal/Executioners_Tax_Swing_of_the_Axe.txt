<<<<<<< HEAD
Go on and look at you
Today is your lucky day
The executioner’s here
And he’s ready to make you pay
You prayed for so long
And now you have your chance
The executioner’s here
And he’s sharpening his axe

Swing of the Axe
(Swing of the Axe)
Cry all you want
But the blade soars today
Swing of the Axe
Swing of the Axe

You buy in the for the privilege
To know what lies beyond
Death hides behind veiled faces
It only takes one swing and you’re gone

The executioner
The beginning and the end
He carries cold hard steel masked with the taste of medicine
Blessed with a reaper’s touch, his might cannot be matched
It’s time to pay the man, The Executioner’s Tax

Swing of the Axe
Swing at the World
Swing of the Axe
(Swing of the Axe)
Even a killer has to get paid
(Swing of the Axe)
