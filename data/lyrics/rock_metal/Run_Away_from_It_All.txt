<<<<<<< HEAD
Standin' on a bridge, see the water keep flowin' by, by
I flipped a quarter in the river, then I headed for the other side, side
I made the same wish that I always do
I'm just fool enough to think they ever come true
Came in like a lion, now I'm out like a lamb
They don't even know who I am

Miles and miles wide open for me
Got it all laid out so beautifully
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, baby, we can run away from it all

Old ghost whistle in the wind in the dead of night, night
I'm walkin' through the valley of the shadow headin' for the light, light
I wore out my welcome like I always do
Got to find myself a life that's shiny new
They say that the truth is gonna set us free
I ain't waitin' 'round to see

Miles and miles wide open for me
Got it all laid out so beautifully
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, baby, we can run away from it all
Squeezin' every drop outta what's left of my time
Jumpin' on tormorrow before it goes by
No matter what they say, baby, we can run away from it all

Miles and miles wide open for me
Got it all laid out so beautifully
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, baby, we can run away from it all
Squeezin' every drop outta what's left of my time
Jumpin' on tormorrow before it goes by
