No sun would rise
In my silent heaven
Without your love
Lord knows I've tried
But I keep looking into
Your empty eyes
Don't take for granted
I'll be lyin' here
When the morning comes
If there's still a chance
Tell me now
But don't think I'll be waitin'
Around
While you treat my love
Like it's all a dime a dozen
You don't feel the pain
Baby, you're the lucky one
Every day and night
I keep wondering
Should I just tear out these
Pages
Can't you see it girl
You're the lucky one
Who have you been lyin' to
Is it me baby
Or is it you
How long would you trust
Before your Lady Luck
Gives you up
Any truth to your promises
Washed away before the war began
If there's still a chance
Tell me now
(Repeat Chorus)
Maybe it's true nothing lasts forever
So they say
So sad
Baby without your love
No sun would rise again
But girl these open arms are
Gettin' tired
And pretty soon I'm gonna
Walk away
No you don't feel the pain
Baby you're the lucky one
And don't think I'll be waitin'
Round
While you treat my love
Like it's all a dime a dozen
Can't you see it girl
You're the lucky one
You're the lucky one
And every day and night
I keep wonderin'
Should I just tear out these
Pages
Can't you see it girl
It's you yeah
