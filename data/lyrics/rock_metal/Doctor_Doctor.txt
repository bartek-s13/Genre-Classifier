Doctor, doctor, please
Oh, the mess I'm in
Doctor, doctor, please
Oh, the mess I'm in
She walked up to me
And really stole my heart
And then she started
To take my body apart
Living, loving, I'm on the run
Far away from you
Living, loving, I'm on the run
So far away from you
Doctor, doctor, please
Oh, I'm going fast
Doctor, doctor, please
Oh, I'm going fast
It's only just a moment
She's turning paranoid
That's not a situation
For a n-nervous boy
Doctor, doctor, please
Oh, the mess I'm in
Doctor, doctor, please
Oh, the mess I'm in
But you look so angry
As I crawl across your floor
She's got the strength
And I can't take any more
Living, loving, I'm on the run
So far away from you
Living, loving, I'm on the run
So far away from you
Doctor, doctor, please
Oh, the mess I'm in
Doctor, doctor, please
Oh, I'm going fast
Doctor, doctor, please
Oh, the mess I'm in
Doctor, doctor, please
