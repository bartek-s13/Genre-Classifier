Al Green / Mabon Hodges - Al Green Music / JEC Pub. - BMI
I don't know why I love you like I do
After all the things that you put me through
You stole my money and my cigarettes
And I haven't seen why I should forget
I want to know, won't you tell me
I'd love to stay, yea yea
Take me to the river, wash me down
Please my soul, put my feet on the ground
I don't know why she treat me so bad
After all the things that we could've had
Love is a notion that I can't forget
My sweet sixteen I will never regret
I want to know, won't you tell me
I'd love to stay, I'd love to stay
Take me to the river, wash me down
Please my soul, put my feet on the ground
Hold me, love me, please me, squeeze me
Oh, 'til I can't, 'til I can't, 'til I can't, I can't take no more
Take me to the river, wash me down
Please my soul, put my feet on the ground
{Rod - Solo}
Take me to the river, wash me down
Please my soul, put my feet on the ground
Take me, take me, take me to the river
Take me, take me, take me to the river
Take me, take me, take me to the river
Take me, take me, take me to the river
Take me, take me, take me to the river
Take me, take me, take me to the river
Take me, take me, take me to the river
