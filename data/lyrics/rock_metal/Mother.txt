I am your mother
Your flesh and blood, your family, yeah
And like no other
Until they bury me 6 foot deep
No matter what the future holds
And even know you just began to grow
Just know you'll always have your mother
The damage is done
I never wanted things to work out this way
My little ones, how do I say how sorry I am
Some day you'll see the truth
And you'll come running back to me
Just know you'll always have your mother
You'll always have your mother
He lies to you, and
He tries to find
Should be crucified, left to die
He paints an ugly picture of you and die
It's so far from truth
See only when you hurt me
But my love for you
I am your mother
Please understand why I had to leave
Pain was deep
He was hurting me
When you look in the sky at a shinning star
Listen to your heart and know who you are
And I'll always be your mother
I'll always be your mother
