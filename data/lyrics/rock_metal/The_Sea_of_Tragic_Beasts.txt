Fall in the fire with me

Inescapable agony
The rivers of ruin run deep
The skill of savagery
Only the alpha wolf claims the meat

Our path is carved with the cruelest cut
Carnage consumes all we've ever loved
The innocent blistered by the flame
Trial by fire, we burn in shame

These tragic beasts suffer eternally
The sad circus of humanity
Remove your wings, rise from the sea
And fall in the fire with me
These tragic beasts claw through the centuries
Devouring the sons of sanity
Remove your wings, rise from the sea
And fall in the fire with me

Unnatural predators
Insatiable hunt for the weakest prey
Kill or be killed, violent will
The flock is led astray
Our path is carved with the cruelest cut
Carnage consumes all we've ever loved
Lethal instincts, sharpened sense of rage
Fight or flight, destroy humanity

Evolution through violence
Defend yourself
Thrown to the wolves
They eat what they kill
Not before I've had my fill
Defend yourself

These tragic beasts suffer eternally
The sad circus of humanity
Remove your wings, rise from the sea
And fall in the fire with me
These tragic beasts claw through the centuries
Devouring the sons of sanity
Remove your wings, rise from the sea
And fall in the fire with me
Fall in the fire with me

There's a hole from here to hell
Fall deep and find no peace
In the sea of tragic beasts
There's a hole from here to hell
Retreat or fight for peace
In the sea of tragic beasts
