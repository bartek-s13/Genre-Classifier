Well I'm just out of school
Like I'm real, real cool
Got to dance like a fool
Got the message that I got to be
A wild one
Ooh yeah, I'm a wild one

Got to break it loose
Going to keep them moving wild
Going to keep a swinging baby
I'm a real wild child

Going to met all my friends
Going to have ourself a ball
Going to tell my friends
Going to tell them all
That I'm a wild one
Ooh yeah, I'm a wild one

Got to break it loose
Going to keep them moving wild
Going to keep a swinging baby
I'm a real wild child

I'm a real wild one
And I like a wild fun
In a world gone crazy
Everything seems hazy
I'm a wild one
Ooh yeah, I'm a wild one

Got to break it loose
Going to keep them moving wild
Going to keep a swinging baby
I'm a real wild child

I'm a wild one
I'm a wild one
I'm a wild one
Oh baby
I'm a wild one

Got to break it loose
Going to keep them moving wild
Going to keep a swinging baby
I'm a real wild child
