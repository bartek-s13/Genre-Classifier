Let it go!
How far will the fallin' star take me, how far can I go, can I go?
Gotta be what the nightmare made me, gotta be, gotta be what I see
Jump clear of the fallin' parts from me, how far will they go, will they go?
Can't give what you want from me baby, just let it go
Bringin' me down, break me down, sweet sugar
Bringin' me down, break me down
Breakin' me down to the ground, sweet baby
Breakin' me down to the ground
Too much is made of what's in me, not enough about how I strive
Keep an eye on your world, it's cheating, keep an eye, keep an eye on me
Deep inside there's a little place for me, a little place for me
Can't give what you want from me baby, just leave it be
Bringin' me down, break me down, sweet sugar
Bringin' me down, break me down
Breakin' me down to the ground, sweet baby
Breakin' me down to the ground
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah-eah
Sweet razor wound
Deep down, slice my groove
Sweet razor wound
Deep down, c'mon and slice it
How far did the fallin' star take me, how far did I go, did I go?
Had to be what the nightmare made me, fuck, just had to be
Jump clear of the fallin' parts from me, how far did they go, did they go?
Can't give what you want from me baby, hell, just let it go
Bringin' me down, break me down, sweet sugar
Bringin' me down, break me down
Breakin' me down to the ground, sweet baby
Breakin' me down to the ground
Bringin' me down, bring me down (Sweet baby)
Bringin' me down, bring me down (Sweet sugar)
Bringin' me down to the ground, sweet baby
Breaking me down to the ground
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah-eah
