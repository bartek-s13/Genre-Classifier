You're blind to what's in front of you
What do you know about the truth
Devalued as, as soon as we're cast
We were never made to last
Just bodies made and fabricated
We're fighting towards our life extension
We're living for our expiration

Under the surface we're not machines
Under the surface we're living dreams
Death lives just one breath away

Somewhere my heart beats in silence
I make my way through the violence
Nobody lives forever
It's a shame you won't live but then again, who does
My endless will for resolution
Echoing since my creation
I'm living for my expiration



It's a shame you won't live but then again, who does
All these memories will fade in time, like tears in the rain
Time to die
