Well, hello baby
Tell me how have you been?
We all have missed you
And the way you grin
The day is necessary
Every now and then
For souls to move on
Given life back again
Fly on, fly on
Fly on my friend
Go on, live again
Love again
Day after day
Night after night
Sittin' here singin'
Every minute
As the years go passin' by
By, by, by
A long look in the mirror
We come face to face
Wishin' our love
We took for granted
A love we had yesterday
