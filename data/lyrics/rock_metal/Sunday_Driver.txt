Woo

Here comes the Sunday driver
Came to get my sister
We know you're such a liar
Can't believe I missed her

It ain't right (Yeah)
It ain't wrong
It's a fact
Sing my song

Yeah, I know he's gonna spin it
Can't believe she kissed him
He said, "Give me just a minute
I'm working on a system"

It ain't right (Woo)
It ain't wrong
It's a fact, yeah
Sing my song
(Woo)
Let's take a drive
Let's take our time
Paying no mind
To people behind
The road stretches wide
You're close by my side
Let's kill some time
Let's go for a drive

It ain't right (Woo)
It ain't wrong
It's a fact
Sing my song

(Woo)
