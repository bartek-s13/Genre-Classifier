Calling all comas
Prisoner on the loose
Description: The spitting image of me
Except for the heart-shaped hole where the hope runs out

Shock me awake and tear me apart
Pinned like a note in a hospital gown
Prisoner of sleep
Deeper down
The rabbit hole, never to be found
Again

Where are you hiding, my love?
Cast off like a stone
Feelings, raw and exposed
When I'm out of control
Pieces were stolen from me
Or dare I say, given away
Watching the water give in
As I go down the drain
I appear missing now
I go missing
No longer exist
One day, I hope
I'm someone you'd miss

Shock me awake
Tear me apart
Pinned like a note in a hospital gown
Deeper asleep
Further down
The rabbit hole, never to be found
It's only falling in love
Because you hit the ground

Dancing on wire both ends are on fire
Cut me loose
Nowhere to run, no more room to pretend
Wandering along the road in the summer night

I go missing
No longer exist
One day, I hope
I'm someone you'd miss
Shock me awake
Tear me apart
Pinned like a note in a hospital gown
Deeper asleep
Further down
The rabbit hole never to be found

(Confide)
With my toes on the edge it’s such a lovely view
(Don’t cry)
I never loved anything until I loved you
(Inside)
I’m over the edge, what can I do?
(But shine)
I haven’t a thing unless I have you
(Confide)
With my toes on the edge it’s such a lovely view
(Don’t cry)
I never loved anything until I loved you
(Inside)
I’m over the edge, what can I do?
(But shine)
