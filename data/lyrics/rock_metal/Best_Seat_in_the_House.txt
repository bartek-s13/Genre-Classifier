Did you ever get the feelin' you ain't been dealt a good hand?
The odds are against you, you're a slave to the law of the land?
I'm gonna gather unto me what must be mine
I want it all right now, not a little at a time

Thinking 'bout a revolution
The first world drawin' the line

We all want what we ain’t got
Some of us have and some have not
Everything I've got comin' to me
Life, love, money in the land of the free
All my life I've been turned out
One of these days I get the best seat in the house

You got a right to your opinion, you got a right to speak your piece
You got a right to be silent, well that ain't ever worked for me
Goin' through the system'll chew you up and spit you out
In the land of confusion, that's what it's all about

Thinkin' 'bout the evolution
Have we always been in the ground?

We all want what we ain’t got
Some of us have and some have not
Everything I've got comin' to me
Life, love, money in the land of the free
All my life I've been turned out
One of these days I get the best seat in the house

It’s the measure of a man
Does anyone even understand?

We all want what we ain’t got
Some of us have and some have not
Everything I've got comin' to me
Life, love, money in the land of the free
All my life I've been turned out
One of these days I get the best seat in the house
Best seat in the house
The best seat in the house
The best seat in the house, oh yeah
