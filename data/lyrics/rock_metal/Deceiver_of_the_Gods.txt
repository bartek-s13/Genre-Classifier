<<<<<<< HEAD
Since I was born, they have kept me down
They have forced me to conform
I will tear down
The holy crown in a vengeful thunderstorm
I loathe their bloody righteous ways
It fills me with despise
Fueling flames of violent rage
I will be their world's demise

Asgaard's always been my home
But I'm of different blood
I will overthrow their throne
Deceiver, deceiver of the gods

All this rage, and all this hate
It burns me deep inside
And still it is, the only thing
Keeping me alive
Dark ambition within my heart
And its aching to break free
The one true nature of my soul
The giant lives in me

Kneel!
You all shall kneel to me!
Or death will set you free!
You all shall kneel to me!
Fall!
You all shall fall to me!
Vengeance will be sweet!
You all shall fall to me!

Asgaard's always been my home
But I'm of different blood
I will overthrow their throne
Deceiver of the gods!
Asgaard's always been my home
I'm born from different blood
I've come to overthrow their throne
