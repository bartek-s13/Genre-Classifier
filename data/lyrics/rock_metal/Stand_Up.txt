I've got something to tell you
Something you can't deny
I've taken all that you've given
I've had it p to my eye
Can't feel the hunger
Feel that you can't go on, now
Stand up and be counted
Don't push your luck too far
Stand up and be counted
Don't push your luck too far, woah woah woah woah
And now I feel it
Burnin' deep inside
I've got a lot of good reasons
Of the mysterious kind
Can't feel the hunger
Feel that you can't go on, now
Stand up and be counted
Don't push your luck too far
Stand up and be counted
Don't push your luck too far
Can't hold on
Can't hold on
Gonna rock it up tonight
Let it roll now
Let it go now
Let it loose tonight, woah
(Guitar Solo)
Can't feel the hunger
Feel that you can't go on, now
Stand up and be counted
Don't push your luck too far
Stand up and be counted
Don't push your luck too far
Stand up and be counted
Don't push your luck too far
Stand up and be counted
Don't push your luck too far
Stand up and be counted
Stand up and be counted
