My dear Annie
Won't you please let me in?
I know that I've made some mistakes
I'm so sorry, I was never really there
I'm just so sorry that I never, even tried

But you saw through my lies
My endless lies
Take me (take me) to a better place
Where I can breathe the air (breathe the air)
Where I can smile
This house is getting smaller, and the blinds are all shut
Please help me to smile
I know that I've made some mistakes
But I'm only a man
And I'm sorry, so sorry, I can't let you in
Just a shell of a man
There's no more of me to give
But it's not going to finish
It's not going to stop
I'm not going to throw in the towel
I'm gonna fix myself
One day at a time
I won't hurt you no more
I just can't hurt you no more!
Let me, let me, let me, why won't you let me in
Just let me breathe again!
Because I'm not okay, no I'm not alright
I hope that you're doing just fine

Let me go
You saw through my lies, my endless lies
But you never let me go
Just fucking let me go, trust me you deserve better
Just fucking let me go, I'm just no good for you anymore

My dear Annie
Won't you please let me in
I know that I've made some mistakes
I'm so sorry, but I tried and I tried
But it was never enough, for you

Yes I tried and I tried
But it wasn't enough
I'm gonna fix myself
One day at a time
Why won't you let me in?!
(Let me, let me)
Let me, let me, let me, why won't you let me in?
Just let me breathe again!
Because I'm not okay, no I'm not alright
I hope that you're doing just fine
Because I tried and I tried and I tried and I tried
But it wasn't enough
I promise I'll fix this one day at a time
