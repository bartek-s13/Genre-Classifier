I wanna hold em' like they do in Texas Plays
Fold em', let em' hit me, raise it, baby, stay with me, I love it
Luck and intuition plays the cards with Spades to start
And after she's been hooked I'll play the one that's on his heart
Oh, oh, oh
I'll get her hot, show her what I've got
Oh, oh, oh
I'll get her hot, show her what I've got
Can't read my, can't read my
No, she can't read my poker face
She's got to love nobody
Can't read my, can't read my
No, she can't read my poker face
She's got to love nobody
P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face
P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face
I wanna roll with her, a hard pair we will be
A little gambling is fun when you're with me
Russian roulette is not the same without a gun
And baby, when it's love if it's not rough, it isn't fun
Oh, oh, oh
I'll get her hot, show her what I've got
Oh, oh, oh
I'll get her hot, show her what I've got
Can't read my, can't read my
No, she can't read my poker face
She's got to love nobody
Can't read my, can't read my
No, she can't read my poker face
She's got to love nobody
P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face
P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face
P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face
P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face
I won't tell you that I love you
Kiss or hug you
I won't tell you that I love you
Kiss or hug you
I won't tell you that I love you
Kiss or hug you
I won't tell you that I love you
But she's got to love no one
Can't read my, can't read my
No, she can't read my poker face
She's got to love nobody
Can't read my, can't read my
No, she can't read my poker face
She's got to love nobody
Can't read my, can't read my
No, she can't read my poker face
She's got to love nobody
Can't read my, can't read my
No, she can't read my poker face
She's got to love nobody
