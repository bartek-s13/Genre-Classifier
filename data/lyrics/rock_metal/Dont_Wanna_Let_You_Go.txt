Everybody wants to have a girl like you
But I'm the one and it's right
Somebody comes along and says they play your song
My wish becomes his delight
He'll try to take you from me
Don't wanna let you go
Not gonna get far from me
Don't wanna let you go
You're special you're one of a kind, so
Don't wanna let you go
Some things money can't buy
Your smiles pasted, my time is wasted
You say I told you so, told you so
You can't tell lies from facts, he'll try to hold you back
You make the tension grow, grow and grow
He'll try to take you from me
Don't wanna let you go
You're not gonna get far from me
Don't wanna let you go
You're special you're one of a kind, so
Don't wanna let you go
Some things money can't buy
Don't wanna let you go
Don't wanna let you go
Everybody wants to have a girl like you
But I'm the one and it's right
And somebody comes along and says he plays your song
My wish becomes his delight
He'll try to take you from me
Don't wanna let you go
Your not gonna get far from me
Don't wanna let you go
You're special you're one of a kind, so
Don't wanna let you go
Some things money can't buy
Don't wanna let you go
You're special you're one of a kind, so
Don't wanna let you go
Some things money can't buy
Don't wanna let you go
Don't wanna let you go
Don't wanna let you go
He'll try to take you away from me
Don't wanna let you go, let you go, oh no no no, yeah
