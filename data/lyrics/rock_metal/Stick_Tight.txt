Where do you turn when you've got no place to go?
I won't live by your rules, these are the sounds of the underworld
Drug infested streets
Feeding on penniless dreams
Children of a lesser god
Never thought it could be so hard
Where do you turn when you've got no place to go?
I won't live by your rules, these are the sounds of the underworld
I call out for the just
The cries of the underdogs
A threat to your perfect world
The enemy of mankind
Where do you turn when you've got no place to go?
I won't live by your rules, these are the sounds of the underworld
So sick of shit thrown in my face
This world don't give a damn
I walk the line of truth and honor
And stick tight to my friends
Stick tight
Stick tight
I stick tight to my friends
