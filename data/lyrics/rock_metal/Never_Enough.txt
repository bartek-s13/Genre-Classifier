When the band's off the ground
Rockin' town to town
You know that it's you
That I need around
And if you're walkin' downtown
Then I'm comin' 'round
For you, for you

I keep fallin' in love
I keep fallin' in love
I keep fallin' in love
I keep fallin' in love
It's never enough
It's never enough
It's never enough

I keep fallin' in love
I keep fallin' in love
I keep fallin' in love
It's never enough
It's never enough
It's never enough

And when the road gets rough
I know you'll always give it up
I can't get enough of you
This feels so good
It feels so good
It's up and it's down
Was lost and I'm found
For you, and for you

I keep fallin' in love
I keep fallin' in love
I keep fallin' in love
I keep fallin' in love
It's never enough
It's never enough
It's never enough

I keep fallin' in love
I keep fallin' in love
I keep fallin' in love
It's never enough
It's never enough
It's never enough

It's for you
It's for you
It's for you
It's for you

I keep fallin' in love
I keep fallin' in love
I keep fallin' in love
I keep fallin' in love
It's never enough
It's never enough
It's never enough

I keep fallin' in love
I keep fallin' in love
I keep fallin' in love
It's never enough
It's never enough
It's never enough

I keep fallin' in love
I keep fallin' in love
I keep fallin' in love
It's never enough
It's never enough
It's never enough

I keep fallin' in love
I keep fallin' in love
I keep fallin' in love
It's never enough
It's never enough
It's never enough

I keep fallin' in love
I keep fallin' in love
I keep fallin' in love
It's never enough
It's never enough
It's never enough
