Legend of the Spaceborne Killer
The Legend of the Spaceborne Killer
Made the front page today
Nobody knows where he came from
Why he's here
Or what he'll do to you
I just saw the flashing lights
They blinded me they shined so bright
Is it half-bird, half-bot, or half-alien?
Well, I don't know
But he's got something in his hand
The Legend of the Spaceborne Killer
I met face to face today
I couldn't tell just what he wanted
If I had to give I would've gave it away
I just saw his glowing eyes
They blinded me they shined so bright
Is it half-bird, half-bot, or half-alien?
I don't know
But he's got something in his hand
No more buildings to stand tall
He must've destroyed them all
Is it half-bird, half-bot, or half-alien?
I don't know
