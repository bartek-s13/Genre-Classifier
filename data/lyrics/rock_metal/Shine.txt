I never really feel quite right, and I don't know why
All I know is something's wrong
Every time I look at you, you seem so alive
Tell me how do you do it, walk me through it
I'll follow in every footstep

Maybe on your own, you take a cautious step
'til you wanna give it up, but all I want is for you to

Shine
Shine down on me
Shine on this life that's burnin' out

I say a lot of things sometimes that don't come out right
And I act like I don't know why
I guess a reaction's all I was lookin' for, yeah
When you looked through me, you really knew me
Like no one else ever looked before

Maybe on your own, you take a cautious step
'til you wanna give it up, but all I want is for you to

Shine
Shine down on me
Shine on this life that's burning out
(I know, I know, girl, you got something)

Shine (Shine it on to me)
Shine down on me (I wanna feel it)
Shine on this life that's burning out

Maybe on your own, you take a cautious step
'til you wanna give it up, but all I want is for you to

Shine
Shine down on me (Just show me somethin')
Shine on this life that's burning out
(You give me something that I never know)

Shine (It's gonna get with you if you can show me your way)
Shine down on me (I wanna know what's goin' on in your life)
Shine on this life that's burning out
(Don't you know I want you to)

Shine
Shine down on me
Shine on this life that's burning (out)
