Our love is dead

We were two kids, playing with matches
(We never had a spark)
Young and numb, sleepless with back patches
There's this pool of angst I'm drowning in
(We're falling fast)
And you're in last year's quicksand paddling/sinking

Gather up your friends come watch me choke
(Our love is dead, hang your head)
From the clock tower, I'm sniping off lovers who dare elope
(Our love is dead, hang your head)

And I'm so sick of singing songs for you
(From in the wings)
So sick of obsessing on all you do
I'd always hoped that I would die dreaming
(Or sleepwalking)
It always seemed like hell was just living/breathing

Gather up your friends come watch me choke
(Our love is dead, hang your head)
From the clock tower, I'm sniping off lovers who dare elope
(Our love is dead, hang your head)

I fell like an angel for you
Now I do the deeds that devils do
And kids are singing carols again
And all I wanted was the world to end
Yeah, and I fell like an angel for you
Now I do the deeds that devils do
And kids are singing carols again
And all I wanted was the world to end, to end
Our love is dead

Gather up your friends come watch me choke
(Our love is dead, hang your head)
From the clock tower, I'm sniping off lovers who dare elope
(Our love is dead, hang your head)
