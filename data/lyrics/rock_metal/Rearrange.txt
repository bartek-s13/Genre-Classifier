I've got a lot of love and I've got a lot of ways to show it
But you should know by now that I'm broken and I need your help
I wrote a hundred songs to make sense of the meaningless
I'll un-write them all if you help me clear up this mess

Cause I would never break your heart
I would only re-arrange
All the other working parts will stay in place
Listen to me when I say, darling you're my everything
I didn't mean to hesitate, please stay with me

I've got a lot of rage and I'm struggling with ways to control it
When I wake in the morning I've forgotten what it is to cope
I scratch at my eyes and it renders me visionless
Even in the dark, what I want isn't what I need

Cause I would never break your heart
I would only rearrange
All the other working parts will stay in place
Listen to me when I say, darling you're my everything
I didn't mean to hesitate, please stay with me

Cause I would never break your heart
I would only rearrange
All the other working parts will stay in place
Listen to me when I say, darling you're my everything
I didn't mean to hesitate, please stay with me
