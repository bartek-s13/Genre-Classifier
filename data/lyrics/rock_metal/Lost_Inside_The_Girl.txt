I close my eyes and I pretend
I slip away lying next to her
And for a moment I will rest ashore
I cross the mile, she seems so far
But in my mind I feel her beating heart
And for a moment we are not apart

And I feel that I'm lost inside the girl
When I close my eyes almost to find the words
Love revealed she's a diamond, she's a pearl
She's a ray of light, a shot heard around the world
God I'm lost inside the girl

Forbidden fruit, it tastes so sweet
What can I do to get her close to me?
She is the only cure for my disease
Infatuation storms my heart
It's slowly breaking me, I fall apart
What can I do? I always fall so hard

And I feel that I'm lost inside the girl
When I close my eyes almost to find the words
Love revealed she's a diamond, she's a pearl
She's a ray of light, a shot heard around the world
God I'm lost inside the girl
Oh, I'm lost inside the girl
I'm lost inside the girl

She can do no wrong
Still she never seems to answer anymore


Her avatar shines so bright
But my obsession is the darkest kind
She doesn't even know that I'm alive

And I feel that I'm lost inside the girl
When I close my eyes almost to find the words
Love revealed she's a diamond, she's a pearl
She's a ray of light, a shot heard around the world
God I'm lost inside the girl
I'm lost inside the girl
I'm lost inside the girl

She can do no wrong
Still she never seems to answer anymore
She can do no wrong
