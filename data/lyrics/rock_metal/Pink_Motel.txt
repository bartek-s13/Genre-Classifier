All this money's just paper, baby
All these bills are just the same
In the end, the only reason for this house
Is to keep dry from the rain
When all your problems are self-made
What you got to worry about
Dry your eyes, we've been spoiled rotten
It ain't hard to figure out
I got a key
To a pink motel
Let's get away from the speed
Let's get away from the sound
Baby, we can leave
We can leave right now
I got a key
To a pink motel
You're measuring us up against
Everything and everyone around
There's a voice telling you to be perfect and it's bringing us down
Just let yourself loose in my arms
You can trust my steady hands
Trust me, if we put love first, nothing can be broken
I got a key
To a pink motel
Let's get away from the speed
Let's get away from the sound
Baby, we can leave
We can leave right now
I got a key
To a pink motel
I can't help if you want more than love
I can't help you if this is not enough
I remember when we never needed anything at all
We'll still be here when all of this is gone
I'm so tired of proving you wrong
I remember we never needed anything at all
Don't wait for me to leave you, baby
To tell me that I'm enough
I don't care about anything at all
Anything at all but you
Fuck the cars and the money
Fuck all the trappings and the lifestyle
Fuck the rain and fuck the expectations you put on everything
Don't wait for me to leave you, baby
What do you care about my love?
I care about you
I care about you
I can't help if you want more than love
I can't help you if this is not enough
I remember when we never needed anything at all
We'll still be here when all of this is gone
I'm so tired of proving you wrong
I remember we never needed anything at all
Baby, we can leave
We can leave right now
I got a key
To a pink motel
