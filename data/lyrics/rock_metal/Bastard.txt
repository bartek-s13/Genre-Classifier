Don't worry your son won't grow up to be a fatherless child
How could you leave your family to fend for themselves
Fend for themselves
Does the guilt weigh you down at night?
It haunts me time to time
Knowing parents abandon their kids
He's not going to grow up a victim
Resentment, I can't hold in all the things I feel
Resentment, you'll never see him again
The definition of emotional neglect
Flows through your body
The lack of contact the lack of affection
How could you beat your wife?
And put the blame on her
Everything in life comes full circle
Karma is a fucking bitch
I will put you in a fucking ditch
Does the guilt weigh you down at night?
It haunts me time to time
Knowing parents abandon their kids
He's not going to grow up a victim
Do you remember  the times you called me out?
But then I pushed back  and you suddenly went silent
Empty a worthless man
He will always know you as a burden
I will be what you should have been
He will always know you as a burden
Still living at home
You brought this upon yourself
And you can't even support your son
Don’t worry your son won't grow up to be a fatherless child
How could you leave your family to fend for themselves
Does the guilt weigh you down at night?
It haunts me time to time
Knowing parents abandon their kids
He's not going to grow up a victim
The  definition of a Bastard
Will never weigh me down  as long as he has me
This is our child that you will never see
You are my victim I am your torment
Never ending Never ceasing
You are the Bastard and I am his father
