Agony
Inside desire that yearns no longer
Memories
Burning the fire that made you stronger
The life that blinded me
Divided me forever bleeds
Divisive blinded deed
The spineless we can never reach

Heresy
Into a wilderness they wander
Tragedy
A perished heart that aches you conquered
The life that I must lead
The heartless one that never sleeps
Endeavour to receive
The strong, the brave, the empathy

Pretenders to the throne
Their willing turns to stone

This life – the last
The principle has lapsed
This life – the last
A yearning to relapse
This life – the last
The principle has passed
This life – the last
A yearning to relapse

Pretenders to the throne
Their willing turns to stone

This life – the last
The principle has lapsed
This life – the last
A yearning to relapse
This life – the last
The principle has passed
This life – the last
A yearning to relapse
