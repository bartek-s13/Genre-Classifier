<<<<<<< HEAD
Silver like a fish slappin' on my tongue
Speak to me the way you do
Hide me all summer in your arms
Hold me the way I like you to
You fill my cup 'till it's crackin' up
The button that says alarm
Says me I'm not supposed to
Be like a champ that's going down
Fighting to get close to you
Everybody gets up excited by love
The sight of the ring, the sight of the blood
I can't sleep without you (4 x)
Referee's in black and he's in shock
The judge is hammering for some solid proof
My heart keeps racing like a clock, yeah
I can't sleep without you
I'm like a timebomb, ready to go off
In my head and in my heart
The light keeps fading in the dark
It's like a nightmare that's comin' true
I can't sleep without you
I'm crazy in the city, it's just not fair
Send me to my corner, and you're never there
I can't sleep without you
