God loves cars, and God loves sex
God loves liquor and cigarettes
He's a fool for the rush just like the rest of us
Cause God is scared of his own death
And he dabbles in drugs on the weekend
Sometimes on a Sunday
When the choir stops singing, and the kids ain't watchin'
And the angels need a reason to pray
I bet it gets lonely in heaven
I bet that God gets lost too
I bet it gets lonely in heaven
I bet that God sings the blues
God loves Audrey Hepburn
And he love Marilyn Monroe
For all those scenes in all those movies
That no one really knows
And he seduces himself with his own eyes in the mirror
On the top floor of the Mariott
It's times like that, God really needs a friend
And sometimes the Devil's all he's got
I bet it gets lonely in heaven
I bet that God gets lost too
I bet it gets lonely in heaven
I bet that God sings the blues
Sometimes the Devils all you got (x2)
I bet it gets lonely in heaven
Sometimes the Devils all you got (x3)
I bet it gets lonely in heaven
Sometimes the Devils all you got
I bet it gets lonely in heaven
I bet that God is lost too
I bet it get lonely in heaven
I bet that God sings the blues
