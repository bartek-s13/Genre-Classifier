Life is so fragile
Like a trembling leaf
Time passes slower
With each day of misery
Things aren't so bad
Hey can you heal me
Hey, hey listen to me
Time fell down my crippled well
And I get what I deserve
Hey, hey listen to me
Focus on your pain
Nothing else remains
How would you answer
If I did the same
Things aren't so bad
Hey can you heal me
Hey, hey listen to me
Time fell down my crippled well
And I get what I deserve
Hey, hey listen to me
I get what I deserved, yeah!
I get what I deserved, yeah!
Before I cut my skin
You need to look deeper within
Hey can you heal me
Hey, hey listen to me
Time fell down my crippled well
And I get what I deserve
