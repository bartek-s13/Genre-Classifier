Lover, I know you're weary
Eyes are tired from the night
Lover, come to the kitchen floor
Tiles are cold, so am I

So take from me
What you want
What you need
Take from me
Whatever you want
Whatever you need
But lover, please stay with me

Lover, I feel your sorrow
Pouring out of your skin
I don't wanna be alone
If I am tonight, I'll always be

So take from me
What you want
What you need
Take from me
Whatever you want
Whatever you need
But lover, please stay with me

Oh, and I can see you
I can feel you
Slipping through my hands
Oh, I can taste you
I can taste you
Slipping through my hands

So take from me
What you want
What you need
Take from me
Whatever you want
Whatever you need
My lover, please stay with me
