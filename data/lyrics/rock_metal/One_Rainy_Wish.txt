Golden rose, the color of the dream I had
Not too long ago
A misty blue and the lilac too
A never to grow old

A there you were under the tree of song
Sleeping so peacefully
In your hand a flower played
Awaiting there for me

I have never, laid eyes on you
Not like before, this timeless day
But you walked and you, once smiled my name
And you stole, my heart away
A stole my heart away little girl, yeah
All right!

Golden rose, the color of the dream I had
Not too long ago
A misty blue and the lilac too
A never to grow old

Golden rose, the color of the dream I had
A misty blue and the lilac too
Golden rose, the color of the dream I had
A misty blue and the lilac too
Golden rose, golden rose, golden rose

It's only a dream
I'd love to tell somebody about this dream
The sky was filled with a thousand stars
While the sun kissed the mountains blue
And eleven moons played across the rainbows
Above me and you

Golden rose, the color of the velvet walls surrounds us
