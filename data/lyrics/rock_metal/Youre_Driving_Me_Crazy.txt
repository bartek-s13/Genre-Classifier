You're driving me crazy, you're driving me mad;
You're makining me lazy, you're making me bad
You know you're no good to me
But you're the best woman I've had
You lose all my friends
You scare them away;
It looks like the end, babe
Of living my way
You know you do me no good
But then I hope that you're going to stay
You ruin' my health, you use me too much
You've blown all my wealth, you cripple my crutch
I know I'm playing with fire
But then I like what I feel when I touch
My mama, she warned me - about your kind;
My friends all scorned me, they say I'm blind
But then I know what I like, and
Babe I like it with you all of the time
They call you a witch, they say I'm a fool;
They call you a bitch, say you're really uncool
But, babe, when I get on you
It's just like getting a kick from a mule
