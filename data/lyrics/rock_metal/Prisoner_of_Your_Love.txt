Something's got a hold on me
Something deep inside
I know that I should try to run
But I feel my hands are tied
I don't know where you came from
But you found your way to me
I don't ever wanna be set free
Woman black as coal, sister to the night
Stroke my body, touch my soul
Make me feel all right
I don't know just what you want
But you got your mark on me
It's become so very plain to see
I'm a prisoner of your love
I don't wanna be set free
I'm where I wanna be, yeah
You're the keeper of my soul
You got complete control
Lock the door and throw away the key, yeah
Every night I feel the love flowing through my veins
I know my body's free to leave
But my heart's tied up in chains
Girl, you've got the best of me
Don't know what to do
Might as well resign myself to you
Oh, let me be the only star of your fantasy
It took me time to realize I'm where I wanna be
Safe inside your paradise, leave the world behind
I'm just a prisoner of your love
