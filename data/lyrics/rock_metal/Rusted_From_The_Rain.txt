<<<<<<< HEAD
I stumble through the wreckage, rusted from the rain
There痴 nothing left to salvage, no one left to blame
Among the broken mirrors I don稚 look the same
I知 rusted from the rain, I知 rusted from the rain

Dissect me 稚il my blood runs down into the drain
My bitter heart is pumping oil into my veins
I知 nothing but a tin man, don稚 feel any pain
I don稚 feel any pain, I don稚 feel any pain
I知 rusted from the rain

Go on, crush me like a flower
Rusted from the rain
Come on, strip me of my power
Beat me with your chains
And if I知 the King of cowards
You池e the Queen of pain
I知 rusted from the rain
I知 rusted from the rain

You hung me like a picture, now I知 just a frame
I used to be a lap dog, now I知 just a stray
Shackled in a graveyard, left here to decay
Left here to decay, left here to decay
I知 rusted from the rain

Go on, crush me like a flower
Rusted from the rain
Come on, strip me of my power
Beat me with your chains
And if I知 the King of cowards
You池e the Queen of pain
I知 rusted from the rain
I知 rusted from the rain
I知 rusted from the rain

Go on, crush me like a flower
Rusted from the rain
Come on, strip me of my power
Beat me with your chains
And if I知 the King of cowards
You池e the Queen of pain
I知 rusted from the rain
I知 rusted from the rain
Go on, crush me like a flower
Rusted from the rain
Come on, strip me of my power
Beat me with your chains
And if I知 the King of cowards
You池e the Queen of pain
I知 rusted from the rain
I知 rusted from the rain

Oh, the sun will shine again
I知 rusted from the rain
I知 rusted from the rain
Oh, the sun will shine again
