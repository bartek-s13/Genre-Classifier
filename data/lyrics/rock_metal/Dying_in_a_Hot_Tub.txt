You're looking skinny, you sleepy head
Well, have you gotten out of bed?
Have you gotten out of bed?
Getting concerned about my lonely friend
Have you seen yourself today?
You're gonna need a haircut and a shave
I can see behind your eyes
Oh, your money is getting wasted
But you're always getting wasted all the time
Getting concerned about your lonely days
You're doing some more drugs
Getting caught in your "drug phase"

Have you heard the news
That you're on your own?
Have you heard the news?
You got nowhere to go, go, go, go, now

Well, I'll fly to the moon again
Well, I'm sleeping with clothes up on my head
I'll fly to the moon again
I'm dying in a hot tub
I'm dying in a hot tub with my friends
(With my friends)

Oh, you're a dinosaur today
Then you're an astronaut tomorrow
You're a spaceman in the Milky Way
Looking for ways outside
Oh, you left your brain upstairs
Next to the James and Pierre, but

Have you heard the news
That you're on your own?
I'll grab you a noose
'Cause you got nowhere to go, go, go, go, now

Well, I'll fly to the moon again
Well, I'm sleeping with clothes up on my head
I'll fly to the moon again
I'm dying in a hot tub
I'm dying in a hot tub, once again
Well, I'll fly to the moon again, yeah
Well, I'm sleeping with clothes up on my head
I'll fly to the moon again
'Cause I'm dying in a hot tub
I'm dying in a hot tub with my friends

Yeah, I'm here, and you're gone
I'll see you on the other side
I'm here, and you're gone
I'll see you on the other side
Yeah, I'm here, and you're gone
Oh, I'll see you on the other side
And I'm here, and you're gone, gone, gone

But I'll fly to the moon again
Well, I'm sleeping with clothes up on my head
I'll fly to the moon again
I'm dying in a hot tub
I'm dying in a hot tub, once again
I'll fly to the moon again
Well, I'm sleeping with clothes up on my head
I'll fly to the moon again
'Cause I'm dying in a hot tub
I'm dying in a hot tub with my friends
