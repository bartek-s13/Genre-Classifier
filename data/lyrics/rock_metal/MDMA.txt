It seems the lower that I go
The better I begin to feel
I don't want this life
If nothing I feel is real
Don't act so concerned
I tried my fucking best
But letting go was never an option
I've got this hole stuck in my chest
Let go
That's what you said
But letting go was never an option
I tried my fucking best
Let go
That's what you said
But letting go was never an option
I tried my fucking best
You said it was never goodbye
Liar!
It seems the lower that I go
The better I begin to feel
I don't want this life
If nothing I feel is real
Don't act so concerned
I tried my fucking best
But letting go was never an option
I've got this hole stuck in my chest
I don't expect you to understand
What I lost in you
I'm never getting back
And you don’t care. x2
Let go
That's what you said
But letting go was never an option
I tried my fucking best
Let go
That's what you said
But letting go was never an option
I tried my fucking best
