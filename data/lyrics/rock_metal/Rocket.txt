Guitar, drums

White lights, strange city, mad music
(All around)
Midnight, street magic, crazy people
(Crazy sound)
Jack Flash, Rocket Man
Sergeant Pepper and the band
Ziggy, Benny and the Jets
Ah, take a rocket

We just gotta fly
(I can take you through the center of the dark)
We're gonna fly
(On a collision course to crash into my heart)
I will be your, I will be your, I will be your
(Rocket, yeah, satellite of love)
Rocket baby
Come on, I'll be your satellite of love

Jet Black, Johnny B
Ah Jean Genie, Killer Queen
Dizzy, Lizzy, Major Tom
So come on

We're gonna fly
(Rocket, yeah, satellite of love)
We're gonna fly
(Rocket, yeah, satellite of love)
