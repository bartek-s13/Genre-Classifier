So hey, hey
And how does it feel
When they take
From us
When they steal
So pray, pray
To a God on a Dollar bill
Have faith in all that is not real
That is not real
I can't take
Can't take
Any more of this
I can't take
Can't take
Any more of this
I can't take
Can't take
Any more of this
You've got to slow your roll
Till you walk
Till you're walking in my shoes
Till you walk
Till you're walking in my shoes
Till you walk
Till you're walking in my shoes
Till you walk
Till you're walking in my shoes
So when you make, make
Your noise
Make sure you turn it up
Break, break
The walls they build
We ain't stuck
Freight train
We're coming
We're coming
You better run to a safe place
Offshore, where you keep all your funds
I can't take
Can't take
Any more of this
I can't take
Can't take
Any more of this
I can't take
Can't take
Any more of this
You've got to slow your roll
So impulsive
I'm destructive
Getting out of hand
This is getting out of hand
This is getting out of hand
This is getting out of hand
It's getting out of hand
This is getting out of hand
This is getting out of hand
This is getting out of hand
It's getting out of hand
Getting out of hand
This is getting out of hand
This is getting, fuck
This is getting out of hand
I can't take, can't take any more
I can't take
Can't take
Any more of this
I can't take
Can't take
Any more of this
I can't take
Can't take
Any more of this
You've got to slow your roll
I can't take

Any more of this

Any more of this
You've got to slow your roll
Till you walk
Till you're walking in my shoes
Till you walk
Till you're walking in my shoes
Till you walk
Till you're walking in my shoes
Till you walk
