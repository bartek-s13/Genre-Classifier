Been a long time, been a long time
Wrestled to the dirt now I'm back on my grind
I took a trip to the borderlines and I doused my head
In some upstream brine
Saw a man in a two-tone coat
Told me everything he liked about the songs I wrote
Turned his head and to my surprise
He had fire on his tongue and green in his eyes
Oooo, I won't let him get the best of me
Oooo, take the money just leave me be oh

Hey! I've been rollin' with the punches
Hey! I've been rollin' with the punches
Hey! I've been rollin' with the punches
Hey! I've been rollin' with the punches

Been a long time, been a long time
Look into my eyes tell me what do you find?
I had enough with you missin' deadlines
Demon with a dollar's been wasting my time
Take him back to his fiery hole
Take him to the cleaners with a sword of brimstone
And tell the rest of your hungry dogs
That I've got a new weapon just to rule them all
I need your help like I need blood loss
Words are for the weak with an empty cause
Give me what I want or I'll take it for myself, yeah
Hey! I've been rollin' with the punches
Hey! I've been rollin' with the punches
Hey! I've been rollin' with the punches
Hey! I've been rollin' with the punches
Hey! I've been rollin' with the punches
Hey! I've been rollin' with the punches
