You call us weirdoes, you call us crazy
Say what you want, say we're lazy
Say we're just the violent type
Kind of dumb
You know we're not too bright
We don't care what you say
Fuck you
We don't care what you say
Fuck you
You tell our friends we're really sick
Long-haired fags on a comedy trip
And you should know
Cause you're so cool
You're number one
You're nobody's fool
We don't care what you say
Fuck you
We don't care what you say
Fuck you
Fuck you
We don't care what you say
Fuck you
We don't care what you say
Fuck you
Step on over, baby, jump right in
This is one game that everybody's in
Don't care where you've been
I don't care how you look
It's all fire now, really gonna cook
We don't care what you say
Fuck you
We don't care what you say
We don't care what you say
We don't care what you say
Fuck you, fuck you
Fuck you, fuck you
