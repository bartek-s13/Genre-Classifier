So withdrawn and feeling numb
Watching life come all undone
Growing fear, a human grace
A drowning mind in a dark embrace
My, life
A disarray
And, I
Fade away
I am down on my knees
Praying beyond belief
The silence deafens my ears
And welds the shackles
Onto my fears
Lost!
All faith!
Lost!
All trust!
Lost!
All faith!
Lost!
All trust!
So withdrawn and feeling numb
Watching life come all undone
My, life
A disarray
And, I
Fade away
I am down on my knees
Praying beyond belief
The silence deafens my ears
And welds the shackles
Onto my fears
I have lost all faith
I have lost all trust
A sordid mesh turning to dust
A sordid mesh turning to dust
I am lost
I am so numb
I'm so numb
