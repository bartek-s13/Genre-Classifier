The wise before me chose to refine themselves
Melt away their shortcomings by enduring trials
A process we will all undertake
Even if we try to prevent change

Face it before you are pulled in
Face it while it's still within

Like iron shaped by fire, we aren't born this way
Shaped by fire, we are reborn through pain
We aren't born, we aren't born this way
We are reborn, we are reborn through pain

Though I too have endured fire
I wasn't wise enough to ignite the flame myself
But carried enough fuel for a flicker to excel

Face it before you are pulled in
Face it while it's still within
Face it before you are pulled in
Face it while it's still within

Shaped by fire, we aren't born this way
Shaped by fire, we are reborn through pain
We aren't born, we aren't born this way
We are reborn through pain
Shaped by fire, we aren't born this way
Shaped by fire, we are reborn through pain
Through pain we are reborn, we are reborn through pain

The time has come to watch the fire grow
Find new things to throw in, don't let the flames get low
I've grown used to the heat that makes me reevaluate
What I carry with me and what should be thrown away

Face it before you are pulled in
Face it while it's still within

Like iron shaped by fire, we aren't born this way
Shaped by fire, we are reborn through pain
We aren't born, we aren't born this way
We are reborn through pain
Shaped by fire, we aren't born this way
Shaped by fire, we are reborn through pain
We are reborn, we are reborn through pain
