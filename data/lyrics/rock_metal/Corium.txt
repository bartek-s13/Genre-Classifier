Supervision end to end and unprovided
For events beyond control
Once committed to progress
Now impelling the downturn, unable to confess
Megalomania, fueled by long gone visionaries
Reign of misguided futurist
No reason to see, the cataclysmic silence they still teach
In the name of progression, admitting of no option
Technology evangelists misled
An evocation of relentless distress
Now fallen from the highest of your victory
Still undiscerning, on and on into misery
Swallow their timeworn doctrines
Absorbing the lies like released iodine
Without protest
There is no yearning for deliverance from malediction
No reason to see, the cataclysmic silence they still teach
In the name of progression, evocation of a certain nemesis
Standstill in the name of progression, we lost control
Now fallen from the highest of your victory
Still undiscerning, on and on into misery
In the name of progression, in silence they still teach
They bought this fatal regression
