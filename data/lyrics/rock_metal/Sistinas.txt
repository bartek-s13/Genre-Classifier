Take my hand
You'll never find another quite like mine
If you look
You'll see that I'm a lonely one
I lost my soul
Deep inside
And it's so black and cold
Deep inside
Sistine smile
You'll never know the trap, it's set
And if you did
You'd never look into its eyes
I lost my soul
Deep inside
And it's so black and cold
Deep inside
The sun don't shine
The wind won't blow when you go hide
Without your love
I'm lonely deep inside
Take my hand
You'll never find another quite like it
And if you did
You'll see that I'm a lonely one
I lost my soul
Deep inside
And it's so black and cold
Deep inside
The sun don't shine
The wind won't blow when you go hide
Without your love
I'm lonely deep inside
