Jane says
I'm done with Sergio
He treats me like a ragdoll
She hides the television
Says I don't owe him nothing
But if he comes back again
Tell him to wait right here for me
Or just try again tomorrow
I'm gonna kick tomorrow
Gonna kick tomorrow

Jane says
Have you seen my wig around
I feel naked without it
She knows they all want her to go
But that's okay, man
She don't like them anyway
Jane says she's goin' away to Spain
When she gets my money saved
I'm gonna start tomorrow
I'm gonna kick tomorrow
Gonna kick tomorrow

She gets mad
Starts to cry
She takes a swing but
She can't hit
She
Don't mean no harm
She just don't know
What else to do about it

Jane goes to the store at 8:00
She walk up on St. Andrews
She waits and gets her dinner there
She pulls her dinner from her pocket
Jane says
I've never been in love
I don't know what it is
She only knows if someone wants her
I want them if they want me
I only know they want me

She gets mad
Starts to cry
She takes a swing but
She can't hit
She
Don't mean no harm
She just don't know
What else to do about it
