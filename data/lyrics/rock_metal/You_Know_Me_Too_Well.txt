<<<<<<< HEAD
Summer was long
And it's suffocating when you're alone
I gave you a call
Baby, I could come by, help forget it all
'Cause in this sticky weather, oh, it's really hard to sleep
As you know all too well
And when we get together, oh, you make me feel so cheap
But I can't help myself

Filthy impetuous soul
I wanna give it to you
Oh, just to see what you’d do
'Cause I'm so drunk on you
Baby, you're all that I want
I want you all to myself
Oh, but you know me too well

I left in the night
'Cause you don't like to see me in the daylight
And maybe you're right
We don't get on so well, when we lose the high
And lovers on the subway, they put on a show for me
But I just fell in lust
'Cause every lover's story always ends in tragedy
If you wait long enough
Filthy impetuous soul
I wanna give it to you
Oh, just to see what you’d do
'Cause I'm so drunk on you
Baby, you're all that I want
I want you all to myself
Oh, but you know me too well

Forgive me 'cause sometimes I forget
I got my own two hands clenched around my neck

Filthy impetuous soul
I wanna give it to you
Oh, just to see what you’d do
'Cause I'm so drunk on you
Baby, you're all that I want
I want you all to myself
Oh, but you know me too well

Oh, but you know me too well
Oh, but you know me too well
Oh, but you know me too well, well, well
Oh, but you know me too well
Oh, but you know me too well
