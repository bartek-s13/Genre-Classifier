Locked away in a cage
My rage has got the best of me
Time finds a way each day
Of leaving less of me behind
I find this fight must be won
Inside my mind
So uptight and confined
Often blinded by the light
Taking it's toll
On my system
Like some played out existence
Time ticks away
These last few moments
Is there anything we've left unsaid?
I'm on a quest for atonement
I've got to find peace of mind
And a place to rest
Biding my time until I'm strong enough
To fight back
Hope
I hope against hope for some resistance
Been taking it out on my system
Time ticks away
These last few moments
Is there anything we've left unsaid?
I'm on a quest for atonement
I've got to find peace of mind
And a place to rest
Time ticks away
These last few moments
Is there anything we've left unsaid?
I'm on a quest for atonement
I've got to find peace of mind
And a place to rest
Rest, rest
Rest, rest
There's a calm before the storm
And the western front is quiet
I've got Rembrandt as my right hand
And Solo as my pilot
There's a calm before the storm
And the western front is quiet
I've got Rembrandt as my right hand
And Solo as my pilot
Condemed Man (Condemed! )
Convicted Man (Convicted! )
Could not save my life, cutting strand by strand.(Strand By Strand)

Convicted Man (Convicted! )
Could not save my life, cutting strand by strand.(Strand By Strand)
Passing it off, Like some kind of king, You don't know peace
Till you've had suffering.(I Suffered! )
All of this so called resolve but you haven't tasted pain
Have you ever been inside of the new masterpiece?
Rest!
Have you ever been inside?
Rembrandt as my right hand, and Solo as my pilot
Have you ever been inside the new masterpiece?
Rembrandt as my right hand, and Solo as my pilot
