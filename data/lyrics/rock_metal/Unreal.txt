Sit back, bare your cross to me, oh, won't I listen?
Goddamn, have I burned my hands on what's been missin'?
I feel unreal every time I try and start to feel
Pick me up, my friend, let me start again
You fucked with me behind this garden
Don't fuck with me
Long before I could even see you're what was missin'
Twistin' deep inside of me, forever missin' the glistenin'
I feel unreal every time I try and start to feel
Pick me up, my friend, hold closed your hand
You fucked with me behind this garden
Don't fuck with me
Can you see all the clear skin in front of me?
Can you see, can you see what you wanna see?
Can you see there's a little spot of light in me?
Can you see, can you tell I'm fucked?
Bleed emotions
Bleed emotions
You sat back, gave your soul to me, but did I listen?
Goddamn, did I burn my hands on what was missin', the glistenin'?
I feel unreal every time I try and start to feel
Pick me up, my friend, hold closed my hand
You fucked with me behind this garden
You fucked with me behind this garden
Don't you fuck with me
