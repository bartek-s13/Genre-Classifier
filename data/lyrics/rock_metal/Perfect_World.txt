Oh, and I
I put a wish in
Made it my mission
To end the conflict
But, oh
I put a wish in
Hoping you‘d listen
Be my accomplice
But, oh
Relax, it‘s only dreaming fast
Giving way to feelings
No one ever stays long
It‘s over when you wake up
So I knew that it was
In the picture perfect world
We can be more than before
I said it was
I made it stronger
From the beginning
My head was spinning
The perfect star
And, oh, a church
A place to fit in
A new religion
I found your heart
And, oh
Relax, it‘s only dreaming fast
Giving way to feelings
No one ever stays long
It‘s over when you wake up
So I knew that it was
In the picture perfect world
We can be more than before
I said it was
I made it stronger
In the picture perfect world
We can be more than before
I said it was
I made it stronger
Uh
Uh
Uh
Uh
Don‘t get mad
You did your best, and I wish
All in the past to stay
So I knew that it was
In the picture perfect world
We can be more than before
I said it was
I made it stronger
In the picture perfect world
We can be more than before
I said it was
I made it stronger
