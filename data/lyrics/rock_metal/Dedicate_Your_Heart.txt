No worse hell I hoped there would be
The worst day for mankind is near
All that I have loved is fading
All I have embraced
As the traitors threat humanity
How can we avoid a tragedy
We should overcome this misery
We must unite
Enemies that should have all been drawn away
Watch the world go down as they are leading us astray
Will we find a way to decimate the devil's lies
I shall spare no life nor souls this time around
Use your anger in this battle, free us from the pain now
Now come to save us
Turn your anger into hate and save us
So that in the end we all be free
The Promised Land, our mighty land
Our future has an open end
We dedicate to life's debate
All that's vanished in this moment
The Promised Land, our mighty land
Try to feel it, not to understand
We dedicate and tolerate
A war that's imminent for all
What does it take to kill the beast
What does it take to spoil its feast
What does it mean to take its life
To pierce the heart with one big knife
Dedicate your heart all for the greater good
The deceivers of the days gone by will face their end
Dedicate your heart before it will be all too late
Turn your anger into hate and free us
Use your anger in this battle, free us from the pain now
Now come to save us
Turn your anger into hate and save us
So that in the end we all be free
The Promised Land, our mighty land
Our future has an open end
We will not fall, we shall not bow
For all that's captured in the here and now
The Promised Land, our mighty land
Try to feel it, not to understand
We dedicate and tolerate
A war that's imminent for all
What does it take to kill the beast
What does it take to spoil its feast
What does it mean to take its life
To pierce the heart with one big knife
Enigmatic monsters just pretending to be men
They will all be driven out as quickly as we can
There is a deep rage that keeps on running through our veins
They will all be driven far away
What awaits in all the paths we chose and do regret now
Precious wins we so desire or that hell awaits
Flowering our dedicated lives, beyond the veil
The promised land beyond the paradise
Just pour your heart and soul into your final battle
Paint with your body, the paths of our pride
Fly with wings of freedom, take your bow and arrow
We all should dedicate our hearts to be
Proud and be strong until
The end will tear us apart
Tear us apart
Devote your heart
This is the dark day all men will remember
They are dominated by fear and apathy
The shame imprisoned courage
That we have been discouraged
To chase victory
This is the day that all men will remember
Until the end of our destiny
The arcs that shall pave the way to our victory
To our freedom
The Promised Land, our mighty land
Our future has an open end
We will not fall, we shall not bow
For all that's captured in the here and now
The Promised Land, our mighty land
Our future has a final stand
We dedicate to life's debate
Yet all that's vanished in this moment
The Promised Land, our mighty land
Try to feel it, not to understand
We dedicate and tolerate
A war that's imminent for all
What does it take to kill the beast
What does it take to spoil its feast
What does it mean to take its life
To pierce the heart with one big knife
