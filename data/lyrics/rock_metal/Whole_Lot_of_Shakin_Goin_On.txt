Well, come on over baby
Whole lot of shakin' goin' on
I said come on over baby
Baby, you can't go wrong

Whole lotta shakin' goin' on
Well, I said come on over baby
We got chicken in the barn
Come on over baby

Whole lotta shakin' goin' on
Well, I said shake baby, shake it

Shake it baby
You can shake one time for me
Well, come over baby
Whole lot of shakin' goin' on
Now real low
All you gotta do honey
Is just stand in one tight little spot
And baby wiggle it around
Just a littlelittlelittlelittle bit
And that's when you flat out
Smack dab have got somethin', you know?
Well, let's go!

Shake it baby, shake it
Shake it baby, shake it
I said shake it baby, shake it
Move it baby, move it

Come on over baby
Don't you know you gotta give me the barn
Whose barn, what barn, my barn
Hey-y'all, I got the bull by the horn
Honey, I ain't fakin', I love it all night long
Well, come on, come on, come on, come on baby
Come on, come on, come on, all right
