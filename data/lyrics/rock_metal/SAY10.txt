Devil's got a cut like a slit in a cattle's calf
Dollar-sign snakes, I'm all in the damn
God-less, fearless of the flood
Or the blood of the coming Spring
Something is shedding its scales
Crying from the heat of the light
Or the empty shell on the stage
"And cash is the poor man's money"
"And cash is the poor man's money"

You say "GOD" and I say "SAY10"
You say "GOD" and I say "SAY10"
Say, say, "SAY10"

Open your mouth, love
Like a gutted church
My goat horns are napalm trees
And a crown of thorns is hard to swallow
You should pray, now
Is it above or is it below?
You should pray, now
Is it above or is it below?
You say "GOD" and I say "SAY10"
You say "GOD" and I say "SAY10"
Say, say, "SAY10"
You say "GOD" and I say "SAY10"
You say "GOD" and I say "SAY10"
Say, say, "SAY10"

Cocaine and Abel, I don't baptize whores
I'm a legend, I'm not a fable
Cocaine and Abel, I don't baptize whores
I'm a legend, I'm not a fable
Cocaine and Abel, I don't baptize whores
I'm a legend, I'm not a fable
Oh, you should pray, now
Is it above or is it below?
You should pray, now
Is it above or is it below?

You say "GOD" and I say "SAY10"
You say "GOD" and I say "SAY10"
Say, say, "SAY10"
You say "GOD", I say "SAY10"
You say "GOD" and I say "SAY10"
Say, say, "SAY10"
Say, say, "SAY10"
Say, say, "SAY10"
