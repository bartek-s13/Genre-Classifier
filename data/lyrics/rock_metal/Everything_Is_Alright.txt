I spent all my money on a pack of cigarettes
For a lady, that I love with a name I forget
That night I taught her how to laugh
She taught me how to slow dance
I tried to take her home, she said 'you don't stand a chance'
I'm the closest thing my mother had to a daughter
I used to be ashamed of that, but now I'm kind of flattered
I learn that my weakness is a weapon anyway
So I haven't touched a pretty thing in 40 days

Everything is alright
If only for the night
I forgot what it feels like

I set out on a dream that I couldn't understand
It made me happy, sad, love, lonely and I don't know what I had
A few too many favours from a few too many fake friends
I wake up in the afternoon and do it all again
Yeah, I punched a man on his wedding night
I'm still trying to figure out how to apologize
I learned that morning, I can't fix nothing anyway
So I haven't touched a pretty thing in 40 days

Everything is alright
If only for the night
I forgot what it feels like
Everything is alright
If only for the night
I forgot what it feels like
(Can you feel it, baby?)
(I can feel it baby, I feel it coming through)

Everything is alright
If only for the night
I forgot what it feels like
Everything is alright
If only for the night
I forgot what it feels like

I spent all my money on a pack of cigarettes
For a lady that I love with the name I forget
And I learned that morning, I can't fix nothing anyway
So I haven't touched a pretty thing in 40 days
