Born to bleed
Fighting to succeed
Built to endure
What this world throws at me
Born to bleed
Fighting to succeed
Built to endure
What this world throws at me
Born to bleed

Built to endure
What this world throws at me
Born to bleed
Fighting to succeed
Built to endure
What this world throws at me
Let me tell you of a force
Crashing through my veins again
Like a page torn from a chapter
Of a book of better days
In the moments that we seize together
Some will never know
It’s these words that never give true justice
Screaming all alone
I was born to bleed
Fighting to succeed
Built to endure
What this world throws at me
Born to bleed
Fighting to succeed
Built to endure
What this world throws at me
You may trust the unanswered
And put hope in the unseen
All our memories come to haunt us
If we still fail to believe
Now the fear we all once held
Is the breath we mustn’t take
Because those who saw in flames in ashes they shall reap
Ashes are all that you’re left with when you sow in flames
Ashes are all that you’re left with when you sow in flames
Ashes are all that you’re left with when you sow in flames
Ashes are all that you’re left with when you sow in flames
All life's sorrows are my own creation
The same is said for our love
All life’s sorrows are my own creation
The same is said for our love
All life’s sorrows are my own creation
The same is said for our love
Those who saw in flames in ashes they shall reap
I was born to bleed
Fighting to succeed
Built to endure
What this world throws at me
Born to bleed

Built to endure
What this world throws at me
Born to bleed

Built to endure
What this world throws at me
Born to bleed
Fighting to succeed
Built to endure
What this world throws at me
I was born to bleed
Fighting to succeed
Built to endure
What this world throws at me
Born to bleed
Fighting to succeed
But those who sow in flames in ashes they shall reap
