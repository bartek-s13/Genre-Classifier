I don't got a problem with the way I'm living
When I look around at what the world's becoming
Stay the fuck out the way cause it's my way
My way or the highway
All of the money, just problems
All of the problems, I solve them
All of the shit you've been talking
You don't want problems you walking
I'm living life on the wild side
Fuck you
Tattooed middle finger to the sky
Fuck you
Bad boy 'til the day I die
Fuck you
Feel the heat when I come alive
Step up
All that hype you been spitting going to get you knocked down
Another level put down
Ya'll wanna tear this place up give me a "Hell yeah!"
Ya'll wanna burn this place down let me hear "Hell yeah!"
Everybody else just looking for attention and mentions
But your intentions are to go the extra mile to troll my profile
You are the punch to my lines
Your nights don't come close to mine
You wish that you could live this
Your vacation, that's my whole life
I'm living life on the wild side
Fuck you
Tattooed middle finger to the sky
Fuck you
Bad boy 'til the day I die
Fuck you
Feel the heat when I come alive
Step up
All that hype you been spitting going to get you knocked down
Another level put down
Ya'll wanna tear this place up give me a "Hell yeah!"
Ya'll wanna burn this place down let me hear "Hell yeah!"
Fuck the ones who doubt me, talk shit about me
You're just a bitch and I'm a bad motherfucker
Ya'll wanna tear this place up give me a "Hell yeah!"
Ya'll wanna burn this place down let me hear "Hell yeah!"
Ya'll wanna tear this fucking place up give me a "Hell yeah!"
Ya'll wanna burn this place down let me hear "Hell yeah!"
