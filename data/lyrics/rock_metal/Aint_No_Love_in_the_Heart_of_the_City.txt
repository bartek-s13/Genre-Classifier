Ain't no love in the heart of the city
Ain't no love in the heart of town
Ain't no love, sure 'nuff is a pity, babe
Ain't no love 'cause you ain't around
Baby, since you been around, oh no
Ain't no love in the heart of the city
Ain't no love in the heart of town
Ain't no love, sure 'nuff is a pity, child
Ain't no love 'cause you ain't around
Every place that I go, well, it seems so strange
Without your love, baby, baby, things have changed
Now that you're gone, you know the sun don't shine
From the city hall to the county line and that's why
Ain't no love in the heart of the city
Ain't no love in the heart of town
Ain't no love, sure 'nuff is a pity
Ain't no love 'cause you ain't around, baby
Now listen
Every place that I go, well, it seems so strange
Without you love, baby, baby, things have changed
Now that you're gone, you know the sun don't shine
From the city hall, woman, to the county line, and that's why
There ain't no love in the heart of the city
There ain't no love in the heart of town
There ain't no love, sure 'nuff is a pity
Ain't no love 'cause you ain't around
Woman, woman, now
There ain't no love in the heart of the city
There ain't no love in the heart of town, hmm
Ain't no love, sure 'nuff is a pity
Ain't no love 'cause you ain't around
'Cause you ain't around
