Once they killed his monster
When he went into a trap
Now, he's making better ones
On a higher step
On a warm summer day
The doctor went away
To a place where he could make it real
His assistant's hips were nice
So he cloned her once or twice
Now, his hips are aching, what a deal
Dr. Stein grows funny creatures
Lets them run into the night
They become great rock musicians
And their time is right
Time is right
Sometimes when he's feeling bored
He's calling it a day
He's got his computers
And they do it their own way
They mix some DNA
Some skin and a certain spray
You can watch it on a laser screen
And the fellow's blue and grey
Or sometimes pink and green
Just check it out on Helloween
Dr. Stein grows funny creatures
Lets them run into the night
They become great politicians
And their time is right
One night, he cloned himself
Put his brother on a shelf
But when he fell asleep that night
It crept up from behind and thought
Well, never mind
Took a syringe and blew out his life
Dr. Stein grows funny creatures
Lets them run into the night
They become a great possession
And their time is right
Dr. Stein grows funny creatures
Lets them run into the night
They become a great oppression
And their time is right
Time is right, time is right, time is right
