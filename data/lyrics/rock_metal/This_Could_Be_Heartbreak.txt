This could be, I think this could be heartbreak
This could be, I think this could be heartbreak

God help me, I've fallen away
The leaves are dancing on my grave
Strings are sounding low, we already know
That our world is ending slowly
As sad as it sounds
Will I miss them when I'm underground?
Yeah, it's done, it's okay
I'm on my way to a better place

The walls are shaking, the Earth is breaking
Breaking apart what you gave me
This distance between us, it always defeats us
It always defeats us, it always defeats us

Our hearts start to bleed as our eyes, they become wells
This could be, I think this could be heartbreak
Our tears become rivers, swimming in our own private hell
This could be, I think this could be heartbreak

Yeah, it's happened again
Wave goodbye to all my friends
Yeah, I can't believe
How my past always comes back to haunt me
It always haunts me
It always haunts me
How could you blame me?
They just watch as my box is buried

The walls are shaking, the Earth is breaking
Breaking apart what you gave me
This distance between us, it always defeats us
It always defeats us, it always defeats us

Our hearts start to bleed as our eyes, they become wells
This could be, I think this could be heartbreak
Our tears become rivers, swimming in our own private hell
This could be, I think this could be heartbreak
Our hearts start to bleed as our eyes, they become wells
This could be, I think this could be heartbreak
Our tears become rivers, swimming in our own private hell
This could be, I think this could be heartbreak

All the hearts that are breaking
All the memories fading
All the drugs they are taking
All the drinks to erase me
All the hearts that are breaking
All the memories fading
All the drugs they are taking
All the drinks to erase me

This could be, I think this could be heartbreak
This could be, I think this could be heartbreak

Our hearts start to bleed as our eyes they become wells
This could be, I think this could be heartbreak
Our tears become rivers, swimming in our own private hell
This could be, I think this could be heartbreak
Our hearts start to bleed as our eyes they become wells
This could be, I think this could be heartbreak
Our tears become rivers, swimming in our own private hell
This could be, I think this could be heartbreak
