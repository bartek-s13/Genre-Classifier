White walls (filled with nothing)
But nervous paces (all around I see)
Something's off (inside of myself)
I see it in their faces

Say anything, say anything
Say anything that can make this all okay
Take it away, take it away
Take away all of this emptiness I feel
Cause I will never find another you
Another you, another you

I still hear you in this house (Whispering)
I still feel you in my bones (In these veins)
And like the portraits in the halls (Can't help but think)
I wish you were staring back at me (But you're gone)

Say anything, say anything
Say anything that can make this all okay
Take it away, take it away
Take away all of this emptiness I feel
Cause I will never find another (I may never find myself)
And I will never find another you
So I'll carry you with me in my dreams, my memory
So I'll carry you with me (you'll always be with me) in my dreams, my memory
So I'll carry you with me, you'll always be my memory

Say anything, say anything
Say anything that can make this all okay
Take it away, take it away
Take away all of this emptiness I feel
Cause I will never find another (I may never find myself)
And I will never find another you
