In the midst of the twilight you could see me come
To walk the endless woods alone
The earth is freezing
As I walk it becomes colder
Forever descending in a place of the moon
Where shadows moves with grotesque eyes
Where demons rise
Surrounded by black and mourning moonfog
And the eyes of the dark ones
Sempiternal woods wait only for me
A path opens clearly
The sun no longer rises
Over cold and forgotten valleys
The sun no longer rises
Where I walk and where I come
I believe (I believe)
In tragedies (In tragedies)
I believe (I believe)
In desecration (In desecration)
To the north and into eternal winters
To the north in the grip of eternal frost
