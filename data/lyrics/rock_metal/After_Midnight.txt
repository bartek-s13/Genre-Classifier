Yeah
You'd better run
Its a hurricane on fire
Nowhere to hide
Gonna hunt you through the night, yeah
You got it
I want it
Pretty soon he's gonna change his tune now
So keep knockin' keep rockin'
I got to, I got to hear you scream
I'm gonna get you, get you after midnight
Shock you, shock you til the sparks fly
Get you, get you after midnight
Shock you, shock you til the sparks fly
Trouble, like you've never had before
Gotta pull the trigger, gonna justify the score
You got it
I want it
Pretty soon he's gonna change his tune now
So keep knockin' keep rockin'
I got to, I got to hear you scream
I'm gonna get you, get you after midnight
Shock you, shock you til the sparks fly
Get you, get you after midnight
Shock you, shock you til the sparks fly ,sparks fly
