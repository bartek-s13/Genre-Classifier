I feel the wind in my hair
And it's whispering, telling me things
Of the storm that is gathering here
Full of power I'm spreading my wings

Now I'm leaving my worries behind
Feel the freedom of body and mind
I have started my journey
I'm drifting away with the wind, I go

I am hunting high and low
Diving from the sky above
Looking for more and more once again
I'm hunting high and low
Sometimes I may win, sometimes I'll lose
Its just a game that I play

After the storm there's a calm
Through the clouds shines the ray of the sun
I am carried from all of my harm
