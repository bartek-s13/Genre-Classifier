<<<<<<< HEAD
Losses, losers and more
Gain of life's pleasures, cohorts listen behind the doors
To a life sheltered in, less than zero in me
All my walls falling down, pains aloft, misery
I'm sure that the lessons were learned
I'm sure that the punishments went well deserved
By the pawn in the plan, taste of shit, bitterness
Walk from me, everything systema-tica-LLY
Come on!
You're the one! You're the one!
To dredge up shit inside of me
In my pointless life of nothing
Tell me! What I'm supposed to be
Tell me! Who I'm supposed to be
Tell me! What it takes to ascend
Tell me! What it takes to live
Patience, pleasures and rewards
Come in due time, stare at the sun, I'm bored
In a life meaningless soaking up all of me
Like the cross, you worship, life is loss, look at me
I'm sure that some day we'll wake up
I'm sure that some day we'll wake from the dream
Of success and focus, tunneling to the light
Glowing deep inside of me, your taunting, I wake UP
Come on!
You're the one! You're the one!
To dredge up shit inside of me
In my pointless life of nothing
Tell me! What I'm supposed to be
Tell me! Who I'm supposed to be
Tell me! What it takes to ascend
Tell me! What it takes to live
Tell me! Now!
Tell me! Now!
Pain, misery, distress, dismal
Know where, depressed, idiot, failure
Loser! In me!
Loser! Who I am!
Loser! In me!
Don't feel sorry, don't feel sorry for me
Don't need your sympathy or empathy
Don't need your sympathy inside of me
Don't need your sympathy or empathy
Don't need your sympathy inside of me
Don't feel sorry, don't feel sorry for me
Come on! I know!
You're the one! You're the one!
Numb to feelings inside of me
Why I've seized my vision
Don't need! You to tell me what to be
Don't need! You to tell me who to be
Don't need! You to tell me how to ascend
