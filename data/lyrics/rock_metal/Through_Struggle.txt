Only through struggle have I found rest
With a piece of me taken away
I begin to understand
Hollow out this machine-like chest
With its gears that turn to make me feel
And assembled thoughts that fade away

Only through struggle have I found rest

Remove from me this deception
That I called love

I begin to understand
