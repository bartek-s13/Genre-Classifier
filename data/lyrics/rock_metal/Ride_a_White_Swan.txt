Hey

Ride it all out like a bird in the skyways
Ride it all out like-a you were a bird
Fly it all out like an eagle in a sunbeam
Ride it all out like-a you were a bird (Hey)

Wear a tall hat like the druids in the old days
Wear a tall hat and a tattooed gown
Ride a white swan like the people of the Beltane
Wear your hair long, babe, you can't go wrong (Hey)

Catch a bright star and a-place it on your forehead
Say a few spells and baby, there you go
Take a black cat and a-sit it on your shoulder
And in the morning you'll know all you know, know (Hey)


Wear a tall hat like the druids in the old days
Wear a tall hat and a tattooed gown
Ride a white swan like the people of the Beltane
Wear your hair long, babe, you can't go wrong
Hey
Da da dee dee dah
Da da dee dee dah (Hey)
Da da dee dee dah, da da dee dee dah
Da da dee dee dah, da da dee dee dah
D-d-dah dah, da da dee dee dah
D-d-dah dah, da da dee dee dah
D-d-dah dah, da da dee dee dah
