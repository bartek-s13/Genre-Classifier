<<<<<<< HEAD
The hangman’s coming, so bring him forth
Get your spirit ready to cross over
You won’t hide for long outside the dungeon walls
There’s no escaping after the hammer falls

Hands to the sky cause it’s tumbling down
Cracking a smile as it hits the ground

Speechless and all choked up
Justice attached to a rope
There ain’t nowhere to hide on the frontline

The gallows’ swingin’ to a dead man’s song
Sounds of flaming arrows, a rhythm so strong
Knights are saddled; send the prison hounds
It’s a war of the worlds until he’s found

Hands to the sky cause it’s tumbling down
Cracking a smile as it hits the ground

Speechless and all choked up
Justice attached to a rope
There ain’t nowhere to hide on the frontline

Hands to the sky cause it’s tumbling down
Cracking a smile as it hits the ground

Speechless and all choked up
Justice attached to a rope
