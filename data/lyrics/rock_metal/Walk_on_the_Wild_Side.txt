Holly came from Miami, FLA
Hitchhiked her way across the U.S.A
Plucked her eyebrows on the way
Shaved her legs and then he was a she

She says, "hey babe, take a walk on the wild side"
Said, "hey honey, take a walk on the wild side"

Candy came from out on the Island
In the backroom she was everybody's darling
But she never lost her head
Even when she was giving head

She says, "hey baby, take a walk on the wild side"
Said, "hey babe, take a walk on the wild side"

And the colored girls go doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo (doo, doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, dooh)
Little Joe never once gave it away
Everybody had to pay and pay
A hustle here and a hustle there
New York City is the place where they said

"Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side"
I said, "hey Joe, take a walk on the wild side"

Sugar Plum Fairy came and hit the streets
Looking for soul food and a place to eat
Went to the Apollo
You should have seen him go go go

They said, "hey sugar, take a walk on the wild side"
I said "hey babe, take a walk on the wild side"
Alright, huh

Jackie is just speeding away
Thought she was James Dean for a day
Then I guess that she had to crash
Valium would have helped that dash
She said, "hey, babe, take a walk on the wild side"
I said, "hey honey, take a walk on the wild side"

And the colored girls say doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo (doo, doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, dooh)
