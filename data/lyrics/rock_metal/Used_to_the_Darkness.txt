<<<<<<< HEAD
I've made mistakes, the Lord struck me down
Caught in a landslide, lost underground
I hear them gates, swing open loud
Come close to midnight, hell fade me down

And then my eyes got used to the darkness
And everyone that I knew
Was lost and so long forgotten after you

Now would you pray before you twist the knife?
Yeah, would you take my hand and take a life?
I'm too damn young to give up on the light
I'm used to the darkness, I'm used to the darkness
(Hey)
I'm just a man, I'm only flesh and bone
I can't bring it back on everything I've done
And now there's no one else left to love
I'm used to the darkness, I'm used to the darkness
(Hey)

Sweet smell of roses, have come at last
One fist of Earth fights, to come join the rest, rest, rest
And then my eyes got used to the darkness
And everyone I knew
Was lost and so long forgotten after you

Now, would you pray before you twist the knife?
Yeah, would you take my hand and take a life?
I'm too damn young to give up on the light
I'm used to the darkness
(Used to the darkness)
I'm used to the darkness
(Used to the darkness)
I'm just a man, I'm only flesh and bone
I can't bring it back on everything I've done
And now there's no one else left to love
I'm used to the darkness
(Used to the darkness)

I got used to the darkness, too
I got used to the darkness for you
I got used to the darkness, too
Yes, I did
Would you pray before you twist the knife?
Would you take my hand and take a life?
I'm too damn young to give up on the light
I'm used to the darkness, I'm used to the darkness
I'm just a man, I'm only flesh and bone
(Flesh and bone)
I can't bring it back on everything I've done
(Thing I've done)
And now there's no one else left to love
(Left to love)
I'm used to the darkness

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Used to the darkness
