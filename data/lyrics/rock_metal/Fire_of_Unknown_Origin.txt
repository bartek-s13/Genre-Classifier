Death comes sweepin' through the hallway
Like a lady's dress
Death comes drivin' down the highway
In its Sunday best

A fire of unknown origin
Took my baby away
A fire of unknown origin
Took my baby away

Swept her up and off my wavelength
Swallowed her up
Like the ocean in a fire
So thick and grey

A fire of unknown origin
Took my baby away
A fire of unknown origin
Took my baby away

Wuh uh...
Wuh uh...

Death comes driving, I can't do nothing!
Death goes
There must be something, there must be something
That remains

There must be something, there must be something

A fire of unknown origin
Took my baby away
A fire of unknown origin
Took my baby, took my baby away...
