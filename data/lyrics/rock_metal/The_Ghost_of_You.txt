I never said I'd lie and wait forever, if I died, we'd be together
I can't always just forget her, but she could try!

At the end of the world or the last thing I see

You are never coming home, never coming home!
Could I? Should I?
And all the things that you never ever told me
And all the smiles that are ever, ever...

Ever get the feeling that you're never all alone? And I remember
Now at the top of my lungs in my arms, she dies, she dies!

At the end of the world or the last thing I see

You are never coming home, never coming home!
Could I? Should I?
And all the things that you never ever told me
And all the smiles that are ever gonna haunt me
Never coming home, never coming home!
Could I? Should I?
And all the wounds that are ever gonna scar me
For all the ghosts that are never gonna catch me
If I fall, if I fall down...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

At the end of the world or the last thing I see

You are never coming home, never coming home!
Never coming home, never coming home!
And all the things that you never ever told me
And all the smiles that are ever going to haunt me
Never coming home, never coming home!
Could I? Should I?
And all the wounds that are ever gonna scar me
