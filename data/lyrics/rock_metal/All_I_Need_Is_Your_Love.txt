<<<<<<< HEAD
Can ya' feel the pain
I've been driving too hard
So sad now but you've gone too far
'Cause you're losin', losin' losin' my heart
Dance in the squeeze
It's a killer disease
Baby, I just think you're lost
'Cause now the time has come for me to pack up the cost
All I want is a smile
To get you right back to the start
Runnin' down the street
Tryin' to shuffle my feet
Got a cat on the end of my tail
Headin' for the sky
Well, there's no harm in trying
'Cause our love, you've gone and blown it away
Dance in the squeeze
It's a killer disease
Baby, I just think you're lost
Now the time has come for me to pack up the cost
All I want is a smile
To get you right back to the start
All I want, I need, is your love
All I need, I feel, is your love
All I want, I need, is your love
All I need, I feel, is your love
All I want is a smile
To get you right back to the start
All I want, I need, is your love
All I need, I feel, is your love
All I want, I need, is your love
