I've been cast out, sequestered
Pushed the fuck around
Blindsided, beaten, locked up and bound
Always thought I was human but maybe I was wrong
I've been treated like an animal, since the day I was born
The wounds that I wear are like the crown upon a king
So heavy they lie, with all the pain that they bring
My life's full of longing, but for what I'll never know
I've been drawn into the fire as you reap what I sow

Like a moth to a flame, my wings burn away
When things are too beautiful, I smash them to pieces
The more that you love me, insecurity releases
I'll be the one that's to blame, so I'll set my soul to blaze
Like a moth to a flame, like a moth to a flame

The ruler of the kingdom that ends up the pawn
So tired of thinking of where it all went wrong
Friendships, they come and go and sometimes they end
Wouldn't dream in a million years that this would be one of them
Faith in the life, belief 'til the end
Failure's not an option, but the options exist
I gave up my everything, I give 'til I bleed
Take it all, take everything, just take it from me
Like a moth to a flame, my wings burn away
When things are too beautiful, I smash them to pieces
The more that you love me, insecurity releases
I'll be the one that's to blame, so I'll set my soul to blaze

You're pushing me, I'm pushing back
Falling down, my heart attacks
Compassion is lost
No more hope, no more trust
I tore it down and burnt it up
All faith is gone
Respect
Devotion
Dead!
Disgust
Hate
Lies!

I'm not a hero or a villain, not a god, I'm just a man
Staring through the hourglass at the footprints in the sand
I'm stripping off my armor, my battles here are done
Wave my white flag to surrender
And fly into the sun
Like a moth to a flame, my wings burn away
When things are too beautiful, I smash them to pieces
The more that you love me, insecurity releases
I'll be the one that's to blame, so I'll set my soul to blaze
Like a moth to a flame
Moth to a flame
Moth to a flame
Moth to a flame
