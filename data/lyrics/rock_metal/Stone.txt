Well the night is my companion and the highway is my home
Got me seeking for one last beacon, every single place I roam
They say Jesus was a poor man, I guess I wish I had a little more of him in me
Make it easier goin' on livin' heartache and misery

Sweet, sweet heart of mine
I'm goin' to break again a million times
Or is this too far gone?
Have you turned to stone?

Well I guess I got my bottle, I still hold it all the time
But it keeps me smilin' and singin', helps me fall asleep a little bit better at night
They say life is like a dagger, backstage is full of parasites
They love you and drain of everything you own, just to feel better about their life

Sweet, sweet heart of mine
I'm goin' to break again a million times
Or is this too far gone?
Have you turned to stone?

Sweet, sweet heart of mine
I'm goin' to break again a million times
Or is this too far gone?
Have you turned to stone?
Sweet, sweet heart of mine
I'm goin' to break again a million times
Or is this too far gone?
Have you turned to stone?
