I saw the virgin's cunt spawning forth the snake
I witnessed tribes ov Judah reduced to ruin
I watched disciples twelve, dissolved by flame
Looked down on Son ov God, snuffed in vain
Blow your trumpets Gabriel!
As I beheld the bewilderment ov Eden
Break the bread, and crumb by crumb into the Leviathan's den...
Nations fall prey
Hail my return (Hail! Hail! Hail!)
Hosanna! (hosanna)
Tribe ov Judah decimate
Hosanna! (hosanna)
Root ov David eradicate
Hosanna! (hosanna)
Let wine ov Sodom fill our mouths
Hosanna! (hosanna)
May Sin ov Gommorah grace our hearts
