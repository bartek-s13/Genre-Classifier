Light the fuse and run now brother
Cuz' you ain't got a lot of time
Don't you act surprised
When it all goes to hell on your dime
Maybe you can stand tall enough
To look the devil eye to eye
But you better make your getaway quick
So you don't have to answer why

The bells will ring
And the flames will fly
Two thousand years of fury in the big black sky
The wind will roll
And the rain will fall
Are we waiting for the thunder?
Will the lightnin' get us all?
Waitin' for the thunder

All the money and the war and religion
And the which one do you serve?
Maybe them with the power and the glory
Got more than they deserve
Why do we stand by and do nothin'
While they piss it all away?
And we hope we wake up in the mornin'
To the light of a brand new day

The bells will ring
And the flames will fly
Two thousand years of fury in the big black sky
The wind will roll
And the rain will fall
Are we waiting for the thunder?
Will the lightnin' get us all?

The bells will ring
And the flames will fly
Two thousand years of fury in the big black sky
The wind will roll
And the rain will fall
Are we waiting for the thunder?
Will the lightnin' get us all?
Waitin' for the thunder
Waitin' for the thunder
Waitin' for the thunder
