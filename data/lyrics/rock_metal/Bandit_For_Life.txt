<<<<<<< HEAD
Time to get busy for some rock 'n' roll
You better get your ass into it, just lose control
Stockholm, Sweden, everybody's bleeding
I need some action so give me satisfaction
Turn on the radio, turn it up
I wanna show you the station with the heavier rock
'Cause I'm a B A N D I T
Gonna bang that head that doesn't bang and do it for free
So baby be my bandit wife, I'm so damn hardcore
I'm a bandit for life
Stockholm, Sweden, rock home leading
The one you overlooked but always believed in
Turn on the radio, turn it up
I wanna show you the station with the heavier rock
'Cause I'm a B A N D I T
Gonna bang that head that doesn't bang and do it for free
So baby be my bandit wife, I'm so damn hardcore
Well I'm a bandit for life
You wanna play my game?
I'd love to see you play my game, punk
So if you play my game, you're in the game
I see you love the change, we'll I stay the same
I'm a devil in disguise with a fat cigar
I rock and I roll right behind that bar
So don't tell me how to live my life
If you want to become my dear bandit wife
If you can't come out 'cause you're feeling sore
I'll just start a mosh-pit outside your door
'Cause I'm a B A N D I T
Gonna bang that head that doesn't bang and do it for free
So baby, be my bandit wife, I'm so damn hardcore
Yeah, so damn hardcore, yeah, so damn hardcore
