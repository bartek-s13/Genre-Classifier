Got to get together
Got to get with the game plan
To defeat the dealer that dealt this hand
I don't understand why the kids are killing kids
When the only one that benefits is the big wigs
They're using death as a diversion on capitol hill
With their hand in the cookie jar, far from the blood spill
They want more power, so they're trying to pass bills
To further exploit and contribute to the landfill
Bleed for me
I'll bleed for you
Bleed for me
I'll bleed for you
We're piling it too high
Talk not saying anything
What we leave behind
What we can't afford to keep
There's no sympathetic posturing
There's no more true humanity
The old ways aren't working anymore
Let's separate the users from the whores
Creepy crawl
Creepy crawl
Creepy crawl
Creepy crawl
Twist the 4-5 cap to get wrapped
Tight slap the wax on the wheels to feel alright
Find the flow, freak the funk like your in heat
Wrap the leaf, strike the blunt, now your in deep
We've got to get together
Got to get with the game plan
To defeat the dealer that dealt this hand
I don't understand why the kids are killing kids
When the only one that benefits is the big wigs
Mankind, unkind, always a fine line
We've all got to die, but this time it's my time
Hindsight, blind fight I hate it when I'm right
He destroys the world while we sleep at night
Twist the 4-5 cap and understand
That if it was up to me, I'd free Charles Manson
Hindsight, blind fight, I hate it when I'm right
He destroys the world while we sleep at night
Throw it all away
If it was up to me
If it was up to me
If it was up to me
I'd free Charles Manson
We're piling it too high
Talk not saying anything
What we leave behind
What we can't afford to keep
There's no sympathetic posturing
There's no more true humanity
The old ways aren't working anymore
Let's separate the users from the whores
From the whores
From the, from the, from the whores
Let's separate the users from the whores
From the whores
From, from, from whores
Creepy crawl
What do we have to hope for
Why do we even try
Laughed at religion long ago
I doubt I'll be an angel when I die
When I die
When I die
Mankind, unkind, always a fine line
We've all got to die, but this time it's my time
Hindsight, blind fight, I hate it when I'm right
He destroys the world while we sleep at night
Twist the 4-5 cap and understand
That if it was up to me I'd free Charles Manson
Hindsight, blind fight, I hate it when I'm right
He destroys the world at night
From the, from the, from the whores
He destroys the world at night
Let's separate the users from the whores
Destroys the world
From the whores
