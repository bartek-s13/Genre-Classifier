Set me free!
Feeling all the love I swear that it’s in the air
Leaving me, floating forever into infinity
I can see the colors dance when I close my eyes
Witnessing mysterious design
I can feel my body rush
From the love inside of me
Can’t you see the joy of life is right before your eyes?
Infinite bliss, infinite love
Take a chance, close your eyes and just dream
It sets me free
Why can’t you see the joy of life is right before your eyes?
Infinite bliss, infinite love
Take a chance, close your eyes and just dream
We walk around blinded like children in the dark
So cold and so empty, how did this even start
It’s time to remember what it’s like to feel alive
Feel alive!
Set me free!
Set me free!
Can’t you see the joy of life is right before your eyes?
Infinite bliss, infinite love
Take a chance, close your eyes and just dream
It sets me free
Why can’t you see the joy of life is right before your eyes?
Infinite bliss, infinite love
Take a chance, close your eyes and just dream
Feeling all the love I swear that it’s in the air
Leaving me, floating forever into infinity
Quantum fluctuations project into the air
Leaving me floating forever into infinity
