I've spent my life trying to be
A soul of light in the darkest sea
Where with my shield for the final fight
I won't back down; I won't bend or kneel

Yea, though
I walk through the valley
Of the shadow of death
I fear no evil, no evil

I look back upon my life and know
Yes, I've gone far, but have a long way to go
And I've done things that only yokels dream
A miracle, so at least it seems

Yea, though
I walk through the valley
Of the shadow of death
I fear no evil, no evil

I fear no evil


Yea, though
I walk through the valley
Of the shadow of death
I fear no evil
Yea, though
I walk through the valley
Of the shadow of death
I fear no evil, no evil, no!

I fear no evil
I fear no evil
I fear no evil
