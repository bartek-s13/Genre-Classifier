Weapons of war in my hands
I will become what begs to be forgotten
Weapons of war in my hands
Ready to purge this faceless nation
See through the eyes
I am the mastermind sent to open god's gate to tear down heaven
Tear down heaven
 {x2}
You are the programmed dead sent to look me straight in the face
I'll tell you what separates truth from faith:
These lies I preach are extending my reach inside of your head

And with my scripture, I will summon the serpent's tongue
These words will become walls keeping angels from the light of the sun
This congregation rains like cinders from the sky
The product of childhood nightmares, empty hope behind empty eyes

Open your ears, hear my sweet tragedy
Open your mouth, drink my sick blasphemy
Empty hope behind empty eyes
I'm crushing the hope of the saved
Haunted, dark, and driven insane
This is my unholy rapture
Oh lord, is this not your desire?



God damned this world
God damned my life
I didn't choose hell
Hell chose me
Hell chose me
Hell chose me
Hell chose me
