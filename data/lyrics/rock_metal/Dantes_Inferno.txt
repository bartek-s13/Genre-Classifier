Through the fiery caverns we sail
Virgil at my side, my guide and master
Questing through the nine planes of Hell
Infernal wisdom shall fill my soul
Slowly now the days departing
The darkened air releases me
Frightening visions of my journey
Entrance me to Limbo, I'm not free
Abandon all hope who enter here
Enter the gates, Charon awaits
Abandon all hope who enter here
For this is where all things are left behind
Every doubt and every cowardice must die
Souls of rage and anger whipping in despair
The souls that wail on this plane pray for death
Denial is the reason for their suffering
Forever being stung by wasps and Demon's breath
The blood and tears that fall serve the maggots' needs
Descension
Thrusting to the second plane
Minos judges as his tail twines
Lustful thoughts and greed whip these wretched souls
A hurricane of hate mocks their helpless pleas
Drifting now deeper into eternal flames
Awake at the third circle
The cold and filthy rain
Punished for their gluttony
Languid for all time
The earth, it stinks of corpses
Damned for all time
The vicious beast Cerberus
Three heads, blooded eyes
Tears his talons through the air
All sinners cry now
All sinners cry
Down, be still thy cursed wolf
The master scorns its name
Dive to the next plane
The sullen and the vain
Suffer for their greed
The prodigal, they bleed
For all eternity
Plutus holds the key
(Chanting, sounds like:)
Zahnah, zantus shan mey
Zeenah hotoh, Satanae
Zahnah, zantus shan mey
Zeenah hotoh, Satanae
Damned, the wrathful and the vain
Suffer the fifth plane
Cross the river Styx
Heed your crucifix
The muddied corpses cry
Howling to the sky
Reach the other side
Open wide the gates
(Chanting, sounds like:)
Zahnah, zantus shan mey
Zeenah hotoh, Satanae
Zahnah, zantus shan mey
Zeenah hotoh, Satanae
Enter the sixth circle of barren land and flames
Passing through the gate of Dis
The Furies scream her name
Belching forth in agony
Invoking her to rise
The spirit's rage consuming us
The evil in her cries
Queen of vipers, queen of serpents
Cast their souls to stone
Spread the wealth of Gorgon's power
Medusa's inner soul
We're drawing ever closer
To the seventh Hell
They violate their neighbours
Their God and themselves
We're sailing slowly
Through the boiling river of blood
Immersed in the depths below
Souls scream in agony
The twisted beast, he laughs
He draws his arrow back
His sights on anyone
Exposing of their flesh
He impales their hearts with ease
And shrugs their piercing screams
Pity is, they'll never die
They'll suffer here eternally
(Chanting, sounds like:)
Zine come sate dive
Zine come sate dive
Zine come sate dive
Zine come sate dive
Lucifer, Natas, Mephisto
Natas, Baphomet, Natas, Asputis
Imagine a place
Where every horror comes to life
Where every torture is real
And time stands still
Eight fiery steps and we're closer to the end
In a cold and timeless grave
Buried head first in shit
Praying all the while
For a quick and painless death
Scratching furiously
At scabbed and oozing wounds
Lucifer, Angel of light
Cast below, God of ice
Ruling Hell, unholy trinity
The traitors freeze for all eternity
Lucifer, betrayer of God
Tormentor, ruthless and cold
Judas screaming here in agony
The traitors freeze for all eternity
