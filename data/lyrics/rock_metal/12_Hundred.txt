Is there really anyone there?
Fall on deaf ears all of my prayers
The mother of nothing
The mother of sin
The father of decadence within us
A brother of suffering inside
Is there really anyone there?
Why can't you look at me now?!
I hope you like what you've done to me
Drown in your misery
We need something new you made up
The more you give up, it's never enough
The more you give up, it's never enough
Or this could be the day we rise
The more you give up, it's never enough
The more you give up, it's never enough
Why can't you look at me now?!
Why can't you look at me now?!
The mother of nothing
The mother of sin
The father of decadence within us
A brother of suffering inside
Why can't you look at me now?!
I hope you like what you've done to me
Uneased by the thought of me
Only through your suffering
Will you learn to forget?
Will you learn to forget through your suffering?
We need something new you made up
Or this could be the day we rise
I wonder why
Who will survive
When we try
With their life
The more you give up, it's never enough
The more you give up, it's never enough
The more you give up, it's never enough
The more you give up, it's never enough
The more you give up, it's never enough
The more you give up, it's never enough
The more you give up, the more you give up
The more you give up, it's never enough
