I've lost my faith in everything
I couldn't believe in anything
Until I put my faith in you
Is it a sin, is it a crime
To worship somebody all of the time?
Anytime, I would do anything for you
I've found my heaven, right here with you
Believe in me forever, I believe in you
Not just on Sunday, I love you everyday
And I fall to my knees
Everynight I pray since
You've come and saved me
For all eternity
In the name of the Father and the Son
You are my religion
I wasn't looking for a miracle
Didn't think that love was possible
But your love has made me whole
And I pray that this will never end
You are my lover, my best friend
You took me in and saved my soul
I've found my heaven, right here with you
Believe in me forever, I believe in you
Not just on Sunday, I love you everyday
And I fall to my knees
Everynight I pray since
You've come and saved me
For all eternity
In the name of the Father and the Son
You are my religion
And forgive me for the things that I have done
In the name of the father and the Son
You are my religion
