There's no point in asking you'll get no reply
Oh just remember I don't decide
I got no reason it's all too much
You'll always find us out to lunch

Oh we're so pretty
Oh so pretty we're vacant
Oh we're so pretty
Oh so pretty
A vacant

Don't ask us to attend 'cause we're not all there
Oh don't pretend 'cause I don't care
I don't believe illusions, 'cause too much ain't for real
Stop your cheap comments, 'cause we know what we feel

Oh we're so pretty
Oh so pretty we're vacant
Oh we're so pretty
Oh so pretty
A vacant
Oh we're so pretty
Oh so pretty
And now
And we don't care
There's no point in asking you'll get no reply
Oh just remember I don't decide
I got no reason it's all too much
You'll always find me out to lunch

Oh we're so pretty
Oh so pretty we're vacant
Oh we're so pretty
Oh so pretty
We're vacant
Oh we're so pretty
Oh so pretty
And now
And we don't care

We're pretty
A pretty vacant
We're pretty
A pretty vacant
We're pretty
A pretty vacant
We're pretty
A pretty vacant
