This is our way of life
And we sleep away our misery
In our blood soaked sheets

We've left our homes to infect the world
And addict you all to this deep south heat
Our bodies full of scars
Infinite blood to bleed
Our presence stops your heart
And leaves you six feet deep
Fall to your knees and recognize your newfound king

Where we come from
The saw is the law
When there’s no hope left
We will not fall among the giants
We still stand tall and we will not be stopped
Just let it go and let the wind blow
It’s like a hurricane inside of your head
The pressure’s never ending
But your brain is still depending and comprehending
Why it is still defending just let go
And be one with the family
Your life decisions have become our control
And we will swallow this world whole
You are, you are, nothing
We are everything
You are nothing
Without us

This is our way of life
Taking cities one by one
Carefully choose your side
You could be one of many sons
This is our way of life
Deafening ears and shutting mouths
Come and join our side
Welcome to the deep south
This is our way of life

We've left our homes to infect the world
And addict you all to this deep south heat
Our bodies full of scars
Infinite blood to bleed
Our presence stops your heart
And leaves you six feet deep
Fall to your knees and recognize your newfound king
Where we come from
The saw is the law
When there’s no hope left
We will not fall among the giants
We still stand tall and we will not be stopped
Just let it go and let the wind blow
It’s like a hurricane inside of your head
The pressure’s never ending
But your brain is still depending and comprehending
Why it is still defending just let go
And be one with the family
Your life decisions have become our control
And we will swallow this world whole

You are nothing
