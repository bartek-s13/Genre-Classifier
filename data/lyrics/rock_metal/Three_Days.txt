At this moment
You should be with us
Feeling like we do
Like you love to
But never will again
I miss you my dear Xiola
I prepared the room tonight
With Christmas lights
A city of candles
Fresh sheets
We are all filled with dense clouds
That have us sunk into the mattress
I need to touch your skin…
An alien she was…
No one made friends as easily as Xiola…
Drug pushing constructors
We were always in the audience that plagued her
One night I met a poet…
Three days was the morning
My focus three days old
My head, it landed
To the sounds of cricket bows...
I am proud man anyway...
Covered now by three days...
Three ways was the morning
Three lovers, in three ways
We knew when she landed
Three days she'd stay
I am a proud man anyway...
Covered now by three days...
We saw shadows of the morning light
The shadows of the evening sun
Till the shadows and the light were one
Shadows of the morning light
The shadows of the evening sun
Till the shadows and the light were one...
True hunting is over
No herds to follow
Without game, men prey on each other
The family weakens by the bite we swallow...
True leaders gone
Of land and people
We choose no kin but adopted strangers
The family weakens by the length we travel...
All of us with wings...
All of us with wings...
All of us with wings!
All of us with wings!
All of us with wings!
All of us with wings!
Erotic Jesus lays with his Marys
Loves his Marys
Bits of puzzle
Fitting each other
All now with wings!
Oh my Marys!
Never wonder...
Night is shelter
For nudity's shiver...
All now with wings...
