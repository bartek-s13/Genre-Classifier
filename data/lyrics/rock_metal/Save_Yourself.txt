Have I been keeping you sick?
Here's me believing a bleeding heart's just a quick fix
All you needed was me, not my solutions or views
I wish I could take all this pain back I've put you through

Guess it's too little too late
At least I can assure you; I had the best intentions

It's toxic, it's noxious, ironically honest
Get out tonight, don't say farewell
Run for your life, go save yourself
It's twisted, it's bitter, it's sickly sweet
Get out alive, while there's still time
And don't you dare even consider a "next time"

But through it all, you managed
I left you bruised and battered
Took you for granted, took advantage and vanished
And you'd think that just for once in my life
I'd take a step back and maybe consider
What's on your mind but no
You're the strongest person I know
At least I can assure you I'm afraid of my reflection

It's toxic, it's noxious, ironically honest
Get out tonight, don't say farewell
Run for your life, go save yourself
It's twisted, it's bitter, it's sickly sweet
Get out alive, while there's still time
And don't you dare even consider a "next time"

You're the strongest person I know
You're the strongest person I know
You're the strongest person I know
You're the strongest person I know

I've never been one to express myself so directly
More with imagery and symbolism
Obscuring my faults behind a veil of metaphors and euphemisms
But just for one moment, I wanna be open and honest
If we can't express ourselves directly
And be prepared to expect negativity
Then we'll surely crumble under the weight of our insecurities
To search yourself
And come face to face with your demons is terrifying
But if we can't face them, then how do we grow?
How do we recover, or know when we're wrong?
And yes, it's okay to be wrong and I have been wrong
And I am wrong, and I am wrong
And this is me, and in all honesty
I'm not doing so well right now
But at least I'm finding the courage to face myself
Self-deprecating? Maybe
Self-absorbed? Maybe
Bravery? Definitely
(So run for your life)
I'm so sorry for all the pain and heartache that I've caused you
(And don't you dare look back)
I just want you to be happy in life
I'll come and watch from afar
And admire you and every bit of joy
And success that comes your way
(So run for your life)
I know that this is for the best
But it's been the most difficult choice of my life
(And don't you dare look back)
I did this for you
And knowing full well the consequences
This is me and my acceptance
All I ask is that you remember me as I walk away
