I will promise myself I won't care
Distracting myself from your stare
And I've seen this mistake once before
With your games I will never fall for

I've hung up my guns
I won't kill again

I won't forget you
I'm not gonna let you win
But I'm tired of lying
Tired of fighting you
And it's not going to change

You asked for my heart
You know that I'm down
But not the way you lie to me and tear it all apart
And beg for me to stay

I've sailed off to sea
I'm not coming back

I won't forget you
I'm not gonna let you win
But I'm tired of lying
Tired of fighting you
And it's not going to change

Counting down
Make that sound
And you know it makes no sense
Counting down
‘Til you mess around
And I know you can't ever change
When I'm trembling
Thrown overboard
And I'm ready to relive the past
Counting down
Make that sound
Break the silence

Pretend it's not forever
I'll pull myself together
I'll say that I'll forget her
I'll breathe
And I'll say she never hurt me
And look at it as learning
And laugh about the good and the bad
Because I won't live forever
We don't belong together
I know I'll feel better
One day when I can make it through

I won't forget you
I'm not gonna let you win
But I'm tired of lying
Tired of fighting you
And it's not going to change
I won't forget you
I'm not gonna let you win
But I'm tired of lying
Tired of fighting you
