Well, I was rolling down the road in some cold blue steel
I had a blues man in back and a beautician at the wheel
We going downtown in the middle of the night
We laughing and I'm joking and we feeling alright

Oh I'm bad, I'm nationwide
Yes I'm bad, I'm nationwide

Easing down the highway in a new Cadillac
I had a fine fox in front, I had three more in the back
They sporting short dresses, wearing spike-heel shoes
They smoking Lucky Strikes and wearing nylons too


Well, I was moving down the road in my V-8 Ford
I had a shine on my boots, I had my sideburns lowered
With my New York brim and my gold tooth displayed
Nobody give me trouble cause they know I got it made

I'm bad, I'm nationwide
