<<<<<<< HEAD
There's an evil lurking in the night
And it gets inside of you
There's a terror with a fatal bite;
Nothing's left when it gets through
It can hypnotize with its evil eyes
No one hears your cry when it gets hold of you
(Chorus)
You can't run from the beast inside of you
You can't hide from the eyes that see right through
You can't run, you can't hide
There ain't nothing you can do
Can't get away from the beast inside of you
It can change before your very eyes
Like a nightmare coming true
With a touch of death you're paralyzed
And it controls your every move
It's inside your soul
Taking all control
Hear the bells that toll
There calling after you
(Chorus)
You can't run from the beast inside of you
You can't hide from the eyes that see right through
You can't run, no no
You can't hide, no you can't hide!
You can't run
