Well I got a gal with a record machine
When it comes to rocking she's a queen
We love to dance on Saturday night
All alone I can hold her tight
But she lives on the 20th floor uptown
The elevator's broken down
So I walk 1, 2 flight, 3 flight
4, 5, 6, 7 flight, 8 flight more
Up on the 12th floor starting to drag
15th floor I' m a ready to sag
Get to the top, I' m too tired to rock
Well she calls me up on the telephone says
"Come on over, honey I' m all alone"
I said "Baby, you' re mighty sweet
But I'm in bed with aching feet"
This went on for a couple of days
But I couldn't stay away
I walk 1, 2 flight, 3 flight
4, 5, 6, 7 flight, 8 flight more
Up on the 12th floor starting to drag
15th floor I' m ready to sag
Get to the top, I' m too tired to rock
Well, they sent it to Chicago for repairs
Till it gets fixed I'm using the stairs
I hope they hurry before it's too late
I want my baby too much to wait
All this a climbing is getting' me down
They' ll find my corpse draped over a rail
I walk 1, 2 flight, 3 flight
4, 5, 6, 7 flight, 8 flight more
Up on the 12th floor starting to drag
15th floor I' m a ready to sag
Get to the top, I' m too tired to rock
