I'm the man in the box
Buried in my shit

Won't you come and save me?
Save me

Feed my eyes
(Can you sew them shut?)
Jesus Christ
(Deny your maker)
He who tries
(Will be wasted)
Feed my eyes
(Now you've sewn them) shut

I'm the dog who gets beat
Shove my nose in shit

Won't you come and save me?
Save me
Feed my eyes
(Can you sew them shut?)
Jesus Christ
(Deny your maker)
He who tries
(Will be wasted)
Feed my eyes
(Now you've sewn them) shut


Feed my eyes
(Can you sew them shut?)
Jesus Christ
(Deny your maker)
He who tries
(Will be wasted)
Feed my eyes
