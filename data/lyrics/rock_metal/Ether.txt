There's nothing left of you
So when I left the loop, what were you trying to prove?
Your skin and bones is crumbling
But now the clouds are parting, go

With blue skies and endless heights
So just fill your lungs and breathe

Slow it down, just wait
Take some time to question life
While you're young and learning
Take it slow, just stay
I know it's hard but moving fast
You're going to miss the journey

Death embrace me
Izanami take me, take me home
Life embrace me
Izanagi take me home
(You're gonna miss the journey)
Take me home

The earth is coming to life again
Go

With blue skies and endless heights
So face east to the sunrise
This is my resting place (Resting place)
Inside my mind
You know it's fine to take your time
So just fill your lungs and breathe

Slow it down, just wait
Take some time to question life
While you're young and learning
Take it slow, just stay
I know it's hard but moving fast
You're going to miss the journey

Death embrace me
Izanami take me, take me home
Life embrace me
Izanagi take me, home

Your skin and bones is crumbling
Just know your clock is ticking, it's moving so fast
And all the clouds are parting, it's beaming with light
So take my hand and trust me
Because we are going to see the sunrise
