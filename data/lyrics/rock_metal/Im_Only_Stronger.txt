Hardship Coming Fast
Catching Up To Sins Of The Past
So Much Shit In My Head, Only You Can Understand
Take Away My Self-destruction
Take Away The Pain I've Seen
Take Away All My Worries
Never Given Up On Me
After Everything
Everything We've Been Through
I'M ONLY STRONGER
For The Hardships We Refused
After Everything
Everything We've Been Through
I'M ONLY STRONGER
For The Hardships Fought Through
We Rise And We Fall
We Gain And We Grow
Another Lesson Learned
I Guess Where We've Headed I dont Know
Wonder Where The Last
Years Went, Running On This Twisted Plan
All I Ever Needed Was
Someone That Could Understand
After Everything
Everything We've Been Through
I'M ONLY STRONGER
For The Hardships We Refused
After Everything, Everything We've Been Through
I'M ONLY STRONGER, For The Hardships Fought Through
Even Though Tried To Drive Us Straight To The Ground. You Don't Have What it Takes To Break Us Down
Even Though They Tried
They Tried Hard To Break Our Bond
All The Pain That You Caused
Made Me Strong. After Everything
Never Giving Up On You
After Everything, Everything We've Been Through
I'M ONLY STRONGER
Hardship Coming, Coming Fast
Catching Up To The Sins Of The Past
IM ONLY STRONGER
For Putting Trust In You
