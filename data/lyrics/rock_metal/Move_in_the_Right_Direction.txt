One step closer, I'm feeling fine
Getting better one day at a time
I'm moving forward with all of my might
I'm headed toward a new state of mind

So I hold back tears
Move in the right direction
Face my fears
Move in the right direction
I'm doing fine
One step closer every day at a time
I won't lose my mind, lose my mind
Uh-uh... oooooh

Motivation of powerful strength
Hesitation was my first instinct
I got the notion my weakness was
Total devotion, it's okay because

I will hold back tears
So I can move in the right direction
I have faced my fears
Now I can move in the right direction
I'm doing fine
One step closer every day at a time
I won't lose my mind, lose my mind
Uh-uh... oooooh
Keeping my head up
Looking forward
Reminiscing will get you nowhere
Never say never
Starting over
It's not perfect, but it's getting closer

I'll hold back tears
So I can move in the right direction
I have faced my fears
Now I can move in the right direction
I'm doing fine
One step closer every day at a time
I won't lose my mind, lose my mind
Uh-uh... oooooh
