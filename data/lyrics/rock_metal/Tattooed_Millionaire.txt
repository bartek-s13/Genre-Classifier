Tattooed boys with expensive toys
Living in a bubble of sin
Money can buy you most of anything
Fix your nose or the mess you're in
Front page news
You can share your views
With a population
Wants to be like you
Out on the strip, out on the tiles
Same old greed behind the PR smiles
You and all your entourage
To me are all the same
You and all your entourage
Playing foolish games
I don't want your big city shining
I don't want your silver lining
I don't want to be a tattooed millionaire
I don't want your big city shining
I don't want your silver lining
I don't want to be a tattooed millionaire
He got a wife, she ain't no brain child
Ex-mud queen of Miami
In his stretch Cadillac
He keeps her in the back
With his CD player and
His bottle of Jack
L.A. dude, L.A. attitude
Laid back, selfish and getting fat
Body guards, porn stars
Gold credit cards
Using each other, running for cover
You and all your entourage
To me are all the same
You and all your entourage
Playing foolish games
I don't want your big city shining
I don't want your silver lining
