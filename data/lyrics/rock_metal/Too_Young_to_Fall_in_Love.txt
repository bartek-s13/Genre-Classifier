You say our love
Is like dynamite
Open your eyes
It's like fire and ice
Well, you're killing me
Your love's a guillotine
Why don't you just set me free?

Too young to fall in love
I'm too young
Too young to fall in love
I'm too young
Too young to fall in love (Too young to fall in love)
I'm too young
Too young to fall in love
I'm too young
Too young to fall in love
I'm too young, (Too young) too young
To fall in love

Run for the hills
We're both sinners and saints
Not a woman, but a whore
I can taste the hate
Well, now I'm killing you
Watch your face turning blue
Not yet a man
Just a punk in the street

Too young to fall in love
I'm too young
Too young to fall in love
I'm too young
Too young to fall in love (To fall in love)
I'm too young
Too young to fall in love
Much too young
Too young to fall in love
I'm too young, (Too young) too young
To fall in love


You say our love
Is like dynamite
It's no surprise
'Cause you've got one-way eyes
Well, you're killing me
Your love's a guillotine
Not yet a man
Just a punk in the street

Too young to fall in love
I'm too young
Too young to fall in love
I'm too young
Too young to fall in love (To fall in love)
I'm too young
Too young to fall in love
Much too young
Too young to fall in love
I'm too young, (Too young) too young
To fall in love

Too young to fall in love
Too young to fall in love
Too young to fall in love
Too young to fall in love
Too young to fall in love
Too young to fall in love
Too young to fall in love
Too young to fall in love
Too young to fall in love
Too young to fall in love
Too young to fall in love
