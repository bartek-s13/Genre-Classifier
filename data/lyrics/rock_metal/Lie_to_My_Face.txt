The scars on my arms remind me
Of how I got this way
I can taste the stain of your sickness
On my lips
Of all the stupid things in my life
I fell for this, I fell for this
I'll ask you like you never knew, lie to me
What the fuck!
Just lie to me, "We're gonna make it through"
I'm well past wanting the truth
Just lie to me...
"I'll always love you"
"I'll always love you"
Lie to my face
Face
Lie to my face
Lie to my face
The scars on my arms remind me
Of how I got this way
I'll ask again like you never knew
