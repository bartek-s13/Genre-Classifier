"Blue Monday"
Blarin' loudly out the speakers
Fluorescent liquid in his beaker
Another night they’ve gone too far
She said
"I don't usually do this kind of thing
Does it change the way you think of me?"
Thinkin' isn’t his forte

And she said
"If you dance with me, darlin'
If you take me home
Will we talk in the mornin'?"

They leave
Weave around the night's commotion
And dodge a Mexican standoff
And catch a cab back to his flat
There's no romance
Sprawled out across the couch
Can't even make his fuckin' face out
An age old ritual
And she said
"If you dance with me, darlin'
If you take me home
Will we talk in the mornin’?"

And sometimes, I close me eyes
And sometimes, I see you’re fine

She said
"If you dance with me, darlin'
If you take me home
