<<<<<<< HEAD
Here in this world I知 awaked with mistakes
But it's love that keeps fueling me
Fueling me
Pretty little lady with your swollen eyes
Would you show them to me?
I know I知 not that perfect
But you stay awhile
Baby, then you will see
Miles away I can still feel you
Lay your head down on my embrace
My embrace
Far away
Pretty little lady with your swollen eyes
Would you show them to me?
I know I知 not that perfect
But you stay awhile
Baby, then you will see
Don稚 give up, baby
I know that it's shaky
Just let love consume us
Consume us
Here in this world I知 awaked with mistakes
But it's love that keeps fueling me
Fueling me to love you
Miles away I can still feel you
Lay your head down on my embrace
Be not afraid to love me
Pretty little lady with your swollen eyes
Would you show them to me?
I know I知 not that perfect
But you stay awhile
