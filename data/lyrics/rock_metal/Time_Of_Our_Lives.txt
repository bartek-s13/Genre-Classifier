What's the use of trying?
I'm tired of all the crying
If I had a choice, I'd choose a different voice
What's the use in lying?
What's the use in trying?
When you done your best, it's high time
That you hit the road and don't look back anymore
What's the use in trying?
Hands in the air
Hands on my heart
When I look in your eyes, I forget for a while
There's a world spinning round, life in motion
And I just wanna stay in your arms for a day
And we'll live our love, it's the time of our lives
I think you need some time
To help yourself unwind
'Cause the way we live is to free ourselves
And you'll give up alone crying
Hands in the air
Hands on my heart
When I look in your eyes, I forget for a while
There's a world spinning round, life in motion
And I just wanna stay in your arms for a day
And we'll live our love, it's the time of our lives
You'll always be the song in my heart
And I'll sing your melody
And at the end of the day
You can take that away, oh
Hands in the air
Hands on my heart
When I look in your eyes, I forget for a while
There's a world spinning round, life in motion
And I just wanna stay in your arms for a day
And we'll live our love, it's the time of our lives
When I look in your eyes, I forget for a while
There's a world spinning round, life in motion
And I just wanna stay in your arms for a day
