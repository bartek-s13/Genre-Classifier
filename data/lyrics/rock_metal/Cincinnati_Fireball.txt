There's a gal they call the Cincinnati Fireball
One look, you fall for that Cincinnati Fireball
I bet you 5, I'm gonna get you 10
She's gonna break my heart again
But don't you know-wo-wo, I gotta go-wo-wo
Back to O-O-O-hio
Now when she walks that walk, it's such a pleasure to the eye
& when she talks sweet talk, you love it, though it's all a lie
& when she tells you she'll be true
But never tells you true to who
That's why I know-wo-wo, I gotta go-wo-wo
Back to O-O-O-hio
Well that Cincinnati Fireball
She's not too tall, but she's got it all
Ooo that kiss, that kiss of fire
It makes you wanna climb the wall
Well I'm a fool, it's clear, but my desire is very small
If I could just be near to my Cincinnati Fireball
'Cause every time I hold her tight
It's worth 1000 sleepless nights
That's why I know-wo-wo, I gotta go-wo-wo
Back to O-O-O-hio
Well that Cincinnati Fireball
She's not too tall, but she's got it all
Ooo that kiss, that kiss of fire
It makes you wanna climb the wall
Well I'm a fool, it's clear, but my desire is very small
If I could just be near to my Cincinnati Fireball
'Cause every time I hold her tight
It's worth 1000 sleepless nights
That's why I know-wo-wo, I gotta go-wo-wo
Back to O-O-O-hio
That's why I know-wo-wo, I gotta go-wo-wo
