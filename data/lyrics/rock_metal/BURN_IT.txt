For all the homies doing time, look alive
For every day your mama cried, look alive
When the five-0 arrive, look alive
Everybody look alive, look alive
You ain't ready, uh
Yeah

See we always on the run
'Cause they be chasing us for fun
When the neighborhood in pieces
They say to pray and look to Jesus
Light a candle with the sun
'Cause we lost another one
Got us pledging our allegiance
To a hand that doesn't feed us, preach

I got a mouth like Malcolm
And hands just like Ali
Black Panther, white mother
You better not try me
I got a mind like Martin
Visions of Rodney King
My city's on fire

You know sometimes you gotta burn it down to build it up again
Lights go out in the town we're living in
Burn it down when no one's innocent
Burn it down

I am a gun on the run
I am a gun on the run
I am a gun on the run

We live behind the lines
That they be keeping us inside
And if red denotes the devil
Then in hell is where we'll settle
If I had to pick a side
It's Inglewood until I die
We the necessary evil
For all these fake angelic people

I got a mouth like Malcolm
And hands just like Ali
Black Panther, white mother
You better not try me
I got a mind like Martin
Visions of Rodney King
My city's on fire

You know sometimes you gotta burn it down to build it up again
Lights go out in the town we're living in
Burn it down when no one's innocent
Burn it down

I am a gun on the run

Fight for survival, but we was dead on arrival
So we gon' fight for survival until we
Put me in front of the gun
Fight for survival, but we was dead on arrival
So we gon' fight for survival until we
Put me in front of the gun
Oh, bang, bang
Oh, put me in front of the gun
Yeah, okay, yeah

You know sometimes you gotta burn it down to build it up again
Lights go out in the town we're living in
Burn it down when no one's innocent
Burn it down
We point our fingers while they point their guns
Bullets, they miss us, we're guys on the run
So burn it down and build it up again
Burn it down

I am a gun on the run
We still killers
I am a gun on the run
I am a gun on the run
