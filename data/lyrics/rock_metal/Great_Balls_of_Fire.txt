You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain
Too much love drives a man insane
You broke my will
But what a thrill
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire!
I laughed at love 'cause I thought it was funny
But you came along and you moved me honey
I've changed my mind
This love is fine
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire!
Kiss me baby
Ooh, it feels good
Hold me baby, yeah
You gotta let me love you like a lover should
You’re fine, so kind
I’m gon‘ tell this world that you're mine, mine, mine, mine
I chew my nails, I twiddle my thumbs
I'm gettin‘ nervous honey, but it sure is fun
Come on baby, you drive me crazy
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire!
(Piano solo)
Oh, kiss me baby
Ooh, feels good, yeah
Let me love you like a lover should
You're fine, so kind
I’m gon’ tell this world that you're mine, mine, mine, mine
I chew my nails and I twiddle my thumbs
I'm real nervous but it sure is fun
Come on baby, you’re driving me crazy
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire!
