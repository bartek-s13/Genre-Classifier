Left her heart in a letter
Said she'd never been better
But now I know
My original sin
She is down once again
No, no

It's been so long
Can't remember the last time, you know
It's been so long
So I'm on my way

I can't see the road through the driving rain
But I won't stop now
Her love is calling me home, seems to guide the way
So I won't stop now

To avoid all confusion
She said she's been using
No, not again
Oh, but my fear of losing
The girl always gets me home
'Cause she knows
It's been so long
Still some things will never change, I know
It's been so long
So I'm on my way

I can't see the road through the driving rain
But I won't stop now
Her love is calling me home, seems to guide the way
So I won't stop now

She's the dark to light
She's never satisfied
She always seems to find a reason to hope
That I'll come back tonight
That I will wanna rise
She pulled my strings yet again
So, here we go
I can't see the road through the driving rain
But I won't stop now
Her love is calling me home, seems to guide the way
So I won't stop now
I can't see the road through the driving rain
But I won't stop now
Her love is calling me home, seems to guide the way
So I won't stop now
And I won't stop now
So I won't stop now
