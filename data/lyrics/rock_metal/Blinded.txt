Have you ever been blinded by the pain?
Blinded, blinded by the pain

Unwilling to see, senseless
So blinded by selfishness
Only focusing on myself
And ignoring anyone else
Becoming driven by despair
Feeling trapped into a corner
Losing more and more of reality
Perceiving all the hurt only one-sidedly

Have you ever been blinded by the pain?
Losing yourself inside the heartache

Losing yourself
Feeling too powerless to change
Stuck and unable to escape
Incapable to see another way
I need someone to shake me, to wake me
I don't even need full clarity
Just to start the shift from blind to blurry
Have you ever been blinded by the pain?
Losing yourself inside the heartache
And does that mean we cannot change?
Or will we always be seen that way?

Will we always be seen that way?
And does that really mean we have not changed?

Or does it only mean
The truth is not in how we're seen?
But in the actions that we're now determined to take
Revealing the new path we chose to mend the heartache
Was it a pattern or a disastrous mistake?
Is the truth in what you see or what I say?

Have you ever been blinded by the pain?
Losing yourself inside the heartache
And does that mean we cannot change?
Or will we always be seen that way?

Be seen that way?
Blinded by pain? Blinded by the pain
