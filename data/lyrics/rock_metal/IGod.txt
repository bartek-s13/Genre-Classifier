I'm not defined by the way you live your life
I'm not confined by choices you made for me
It doesn't matter why - it won't justify my life
You're not my fault, you're my disease
It's not a question of flaws and imperfections
That bullshit you stepped in is over so end it
I'm not affected by the standards you live with
Your judgment is based upon tailored exceptions
Your ammunition is flawed and defenseless
It ends with the question that answers existence
I'm done with defenseless! The demons are restless!
Relentless to ever give into resistance!

Why can you hold back the anger?
Why do you hold me inside?
Why won't you channel the rages?
Use what your God gave you!
Why do you hold back the anger?
Why do you hold me inside?
Why won't you channel the rages?
Use what your God gave you!

You won't be satisfied until you save my life
Questions followed by reasons you'll pray for me
And how you'll sacrifice, when it's you who's lost inside
I'm not your fault, I'm your disease
It's not a question of flaws and imperfections
That bullshit you stepped in is over so end it
I'm not affected by the standards you live with
Your judgment is based upon tailored exceptions
Your ammunition is flawed and defenseless
It ends with the question that answers existence
I'm done with defenseless! The demons are restless!
Relentless to ever give into resistance!

Why do you hold back the anger?
Why do you hold me inside?
Why won't you channel the rages?
Use what your God gave you!
Why do you hold back the anger?
Why do you hold me inside?
Why won't you channel the rages?
Use what your God gave you!

What your God gave you!
Listen to your God!

Why can you hold back the anger?
Why do you hold me inside?
Why won't you channel the rages?
Use what your God gave you!
Why can you hold back the anger?
Why do you hold me inside?
Why won't you channel the rages?
Use what your God gave you!
Why do you hold back the anger?
Why do you hold me inside?
Why won't you channel the rages?
Use what your God gave you!
