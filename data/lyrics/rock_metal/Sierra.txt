What about the one who said he loved you?
What about the one who said he cared?
Don't bother trying to find him
Way up in the icy air
Oh, you played with his heartstrings
And you played without a care
But not up in the High Sierra
You won't play his heart out there
The angels lay their clouds across his sky
They line up for him every night
Some have wings and others sing
The rest do lazy ballets in the air
There he's got a bird to give him warning
And he's gotta lookout too
The beauty of the High Sierra
And she's looking out for you
The angels lay their clouds across his sky
They line up for him every night
Some have wings and others sing
The rest do lazy ballets in the air
What about the one who said he loved you?
What about the one who said he cared?
He's up in the High Sierra
