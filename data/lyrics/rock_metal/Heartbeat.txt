Heartbeat
Why do you miss when my baby kisses me?
Heartbeat
Why does a love kiss stay in my memory?
Piddle dee pat
I know that new love thrills me
I know that true love will be

Heartbeat
Why do you miss when my baby kisses me?
Heartbeat
Why do you skip when my baby's lips meet mine?
Heartbeat
Why do you flip then give me a skip beat sign?
Piddle dee pat
And sing to me love stories
