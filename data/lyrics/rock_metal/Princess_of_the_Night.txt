She used to be an ironhorse
Twenty years ago
Used to bring the mail to me
Through the ice and snow
I've sat alone and watched her
Steaming through the night
Ninety tons of thunder
Lighting up the sky
She was a princess of the night
I saw the writing on the wall
She was a princess of the night
I take a ride across the sky
Speeding, sparks like lightning
Engine working hard
Furnace on the foot plate
Shining in the night
Iron striking metal
The sound of racing steel
It's all I ever wanna hear
It's music to my ears
She was a princess of the night
I saw the writing on the wall
She was a princess of the night
I take a ride across the sky
She was a princess of the night
I saw the writing on the wall
She was a princess of the night
I take a ride across the sky
Ninety tons of thunder
Lighting up the sky
Steaming red hot pistons
See the wheels flash by
Hear the whistle blowing
Streaking down the track
If I ever had my way
I'd bring the princess back one day
She was a princess of the night
I saw the writing on the wall
She was a princess of the night
I take a ride across the sky
