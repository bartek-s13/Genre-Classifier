She’s checkin’ out
She’s checkin’ out on me

Not long ago
You were laying right here
And the blue light flickered
Love everywhere
Now you’re checkin’ out
And I’m missin’ you
The smell of cigarettes
Is takin’ over for the pain in my chest
And you’re checkin’ out
This old hotel will never be home ‘cause you are home to me

This is my wake up call
I slept through it
Going through life
Hypnotic
Come home, come ho-o-ome, come home, come ho-o-ome
These four walls is
Where I live
With a ghost of you
Is all I get
Come home, come ho-o-ome, come home, come ho-o-ome
This old hotel will never be home ‘cause you are home to me
This worn out rug
Has seen its day
These old walls are peeling away
Just like us
And I’m freakin’ out
The TV’s broke there’s nothin’ on
Just memories of us that’ll soon be gone
And I’m freakin’ out
This old hotel will never be home ‘cause you are home to me

This is my wake up call
I slept through it
Going through life
Hypnotic
Come home, come ho-o-ome, come home, come ho-o-ome
These four walls is
Where I live
With a ghost of you
Is all I get
Come home, come ho-o-ome, come home, come ho-o-ome
This old hotel will never be home ‘cause you are home to me

It’s funny how our love fucks me like it always does
It’s funny now your gone I’m seeing how it really was
I don’t wanna wake up, I’ve really had enough
I don’t wanna wake up, still feeling in love
This is my wake up call
I slept through it
Going through life
Hypnotic
Come home, come ho-o-ome, come home, come ho-o-ome
These four walls is
Where I live
With a ghost of you
Is all I get
Come home, come ho-o-ome, come home, come ho-o-ome
This old hotel will never be home ‘cause you are home to me
