Everything that's known to man
Got it right here in the palm of my hand
It's all a part of the master plan
One push of a button and you'll understand
All you get is the information
Censoring the situation

Oh my God, it's taking me
From the phonograph record to the MP3
All the world is overrun with Technology
Oh my God it seems to me
We've gotta get back to simplicity
All the world's out of touch with reality
I can't believe

Honest values of family
Come straight from the heart like the blood we bleed
And reachin' out to a friend in need
Means more than a text from a cell phone screen
All these sounds of complication
In the cloud communication

Oh my God it's taking me
From the phonograph record to the MP3
All the world is overrun with Technology
Oh my God it seems to me
We gotta get back to Simplicity
All the world is outta touch with reality
It's plain to see
Rewind now

Oh my God it's taking me
From the phonograph record to the MP3
All the world is overrun with Technology
Oh my God it seems to me
We gotta get back to Simplicity
All the world is outta touch with reality
