<<<<<<< HEAD
Along the way I find myself to be confined within me
No place for any others mind to interfere
To grasp the meaning of it all, to overcome my limits
And dance away from any void and empty tones
Just tell me why
Just tell me how I can survive this time
Believe yourselves and look away from all that's right within you
Leave all your worries at the door and drift away
I’ve tried to peer into the core but could not storm the sorrow
My hollow heart has bled me dry, left me to stray
Another time
Without a trace
Condemn me now
Send me to hell for I'm already failing
Intertwine the lines that swim beneath the dark
Realize the pain we live in
Demonize the need we reel in
No, in my memories I'll dig deep enough to know
Centuries of dreams unending
Another me that yielded tears when someone had betrayed
No time should ever go to waste, it’s not that complicated
You’re free to live your life at ease, no more restraints
No heed for shadows on your way that try to steal your laughter
Your light will drive them all away, be confident
Will I refrain?
Can I repent?
Will you be there?
Erase the page for I’m alone and ailing
Intertwine the lines that swim beneath the dark
Realize the pain we live in
Demonize the need we reel in
No, in my memories I'll dig deep enough to know
Centuries of dreams unending
Another me that yielded tears when someone had betrayed
So - this is my life
And it can't break me down
Go - I will decide
Who can come in
And heal my disease
Burn it - in flames
Kill it - and maim
Why can't you see that you need to be freed
Intertwine the lines beneath the dark
Every bit of pain we're feeling
Every other solemn life
No, in the memories you will find somehow
There used to be a dream unending
No more need to be alone
Intertwine the lines that swim beneath the dark
Realize the pain we live in
Demonize the need we reel in
No, in my memories I'll dig deep enough to know
Centuries of dreams unending
