Walking alone, the beach is over
Seem that the love won't last forever
It's like forever, is coming and go
Like the words to make you cry
Still burning in my mind
What I gotta do
To turn back the time
What I gotta do, baby
To take away the tears you cry
I don't wanna let you precious heart
Sleep through my hand
Don't let my love passed away
Like footprints in the sand
Footprints in the sand
Sun goes down on another heartache
Feels like a million miles between us
Gotta find a way to your forgiveness
Don't wanna walk alone no more
Like a stranger on the shore
What I gotta do
To turn back the time
What I gotta do, baby
To take away the tears you cry
I don't wanna let you precious heart
Sleep through my hand
Don't let my love passed away
Like footprints in the sand
Footprints in the sand
(Baby, i don't go on like this
Just tell me what to do to make
How much you care)
What I gotta do
To turn back the time
What I gotta do, baby
To take away the tears you cry
I don't wanna let you precious heart
Sleep through my hand
Don't let my love passed away
Like footprints in the sand
Footprints in the sand
Footprints in the sand
