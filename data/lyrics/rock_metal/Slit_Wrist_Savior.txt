That was her first time
That was her last time
Cut at your face
Blood in the sink
You'll hate yourself
Till the day you die
Till the day you die
Blood on your hands
Blood on your legs
Why does this happen time and time again?
Time and time again
Blood
I should have sown my heart in my chest
Our eyes should have never met
Eyes should have never met
Never met
I should have sown my heart in my chest
Our eyes should have never met
Fine, fuck you then
Slit wrist savior
She cuts to see blood
She cuts to see blood
She cuts to see blood
Slit wrist savior
Slit wrist savior
Slit wrist savior
Slit wrists
She cuts to see blood
She cuts to see blood
