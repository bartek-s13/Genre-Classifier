If you knew Peggy Sue
Then you'd know why I feel blue
Without Peggy, my Peggy Sue
Oh well I love you girl, yes, I love you Peggy Sue

Peggy Sue, Peggy Sue
Oh how my heart yearns for you
Oh Peggy, my Peggy Sue
Oh well I love you girl, yes, I love you Peggy Sue

Peggy Sue, Peggy Sue
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty Peggy Sue
Oh Peggy, my Peggy Sue
Oh well I love you girl, and I need you Peggy Sue

I love you, Peggy Sue, with a love so rare and true
Oh Peggy, my Peggy Sue
Well I love you girl, I want you Peggy Sue


Peggy Sue, Peggy Sue
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty Peggy Sue
Oh Peggy, my Peggy Sue
Oh well I love you girl, yes, I need you Peggy Sue

I love you, Peggy Sue, with a love so rare and true
Oh Peggy, my Peggy Sue
Oh well I love you girl, and I want you Peggy Sue
