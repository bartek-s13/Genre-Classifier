One, two, three, four
(All the things that you said was it all in my head?)

Come on, baby, keep it down, honey, hush your lips
Clothes trailing from the backdoor to the bedroom
And I don't even know your name
Give me all you've got, make this night worth my time
Make this worth my time
Oh, what I'd give to live this night again
I knew when I first saw you
You'd fuck like a whore!
You'd fuck like a whore!
I can hear you scream for more, yeah

Your thighs were made for cheeks to graze
My lips, your poison, they bring you to your knees
Your thighs were made for cheeks to graze
My lips, your poison, they bring you to your knees

Come on, girl, get down, it's almost over
Take it all the way, oh!
(You stupid fucking) Whore!
And after all of all my dreaming being only you
You're standing there, baby, oh, the things that I could do
Back to the wall with a drink in my hand
Back it up, baby, ride, ride, ride

And one step too late and I never told you (Never told you)
That I can't take another disappointment
Breathing and grasping all leads to another messy ending
Breathing and grasping all leads to another messy ending
Ten Inch!

With your back against the wall!
With your face buried in the pillow!
I see you cold, I feel you heartless!
Bitch, you stupid fucking bitch!
You stupid fucking bitch!

Fucking bitch
