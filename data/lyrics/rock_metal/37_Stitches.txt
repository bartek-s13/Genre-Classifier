Do you see me sittin' here?
I'm waitin' for you to say anything
Head hung low, kicking stones down
Kicking stones down the road to Hell, now
I'm waiting for you to say anything
Oh, anything, yeah
I know you are the only one
A little taste of Heaven
And you know I am the only one
Your bitter taste of Hell
Your eyes scream, the end is creepin' in on me
37 stitches to keep the pain in
And I know you are the only one
On the darkest side of the Sun
On the darkest side of the Sun
Ooh yeah
Followed The Piper's sweet whistlin'
Guided down the path by the wrong hand
Closed my eyes for the chance of a better view
Close my ears so I couldn't hear you
And I know you are the one
You know I am the one
Your bitter taste of Hell
I know you are the only one
A little taste of Heaven
And you know I am the only one
Your bitter taste of Hell
Your eyes scream, the end is creepin' in on me
37 stitches to keep the pain in
And I know you are the only one
On the darkest side of the Sun
Do you see me sittin' here?
Still waitin' for you to say anything
Head hung low, kicking stones down
Kicking stones down the road to Hell, now
I'm waiting for you, I'm waiting for you
Just say anything, yeah!
I know you are the only one
A little taste of Heaven
And you know I am the only one
Your bitter taste of Hell
Your eyes scream, the end is creepin' in on me
37 stitches, 37 stitches yeah!
And I know you are the only one
On the darkest side of the Sun
I know, I know
(On the darkest side of the Sun)
You are the one on the darkest side of the Sun
