I know what you're thinking
Good love has passed you by
Just can't seem to find it
No matter how you try
Never push the river
You got to let it flow
Once you've got the fever
Surely gonna know
Love is all around you
Love is where you find it
Take it where you find it
Love is where you find it
Take it where you find it
(Oh, take it where you find it)
Climbed the highest mountain
Sailed the seven seas
Found the gate to heaven
But you didn't have a key
The world just keeps on turning
The moon will turn the tide
Once you've got the fever
Nowhere you can hide
Love is all around you
Love is where you find it
Take it where you find it
(Oh, take it where you find it)
Love is where you find it
Take it where you find it
Never push the river
You got to let it flow
Once you've got the fever
Surely gonna know
Love is all around you
Love is where you find it
Take it where you find it
Love is where you find it
Take it where you find it
Love is where you find it
Take it where you find it
(I said take it, take it, take it where you find it)
Love is where you find it
Take it where you find it
(Take it, take it where you find it now)
Love is where you find it
Take it where you find it
(I said, take it where you find it, baby)
Love is where you find it
Take it where you find it
(Take it, take it where you find it, baby)
Love is where you find it
Take it where you find it
Love is where you find it
