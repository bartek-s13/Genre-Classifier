Someday I'm gonna wake up
And you won't be on my mind
And maybe, I won't hate myself
For eating you alive
Perhaps the very thought of you
Will only make me smile
Someday I'm gonna wake up
And you won't be on my mind

Cause all them dirty things
Made me think that love
Was a lot like hate
And all them fiery nights
Just could not make up for the firefights
Ooh, thank you for saying goodbye

Someday you're gonna wake up
From a deep and happy sleep
And say "baby, I don't hate you
For the breath you stole from me"
Perhaps I'll see you downtown
And you'll take me for a drink
Someday you're gonna wake up
And your heart ain't gonna sink
Cause all them dirty things
Made me think that love
Is a lot like hate
Cause all them Friday nights
That you went home cryin'
They're still my fault
Ooh, ooh, thank you for saying goodbye

Cause all them dirty things
Made me think that love
Was a lot like hate
And all them fiery nights
Just could not make up for them firefights
Ooh, ooh, thank you for saying goodbye
