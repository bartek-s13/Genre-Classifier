Well I hear my train coming
Hear my train coming

Well, I wait around the train station
Waiting for that train
Take me, take me, take me away
From this lonesome town
Lonesome town
Too bad you don't love me any more, girl
Too bad your people put me down
Hey, hey, hey
Tears burning me
Tears burning me in my eyes
Way down, way down in my soul
Burning me way down in my heart
Too bad you don't love me no more, girl
Too bad you and me have to part
Have to part

Well I hear my train coming
Hear my train coming
Well I hear my train coming
Hear my train coming
