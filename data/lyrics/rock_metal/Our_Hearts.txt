We ain't been alone since the day we met
And we can't keep our hands to ourselves
It's almost wrong how we get

Ooh, something about you
Something about me, something about us
Well some folks think that you can't fall this hard
But these are our hearts

I knew it in the car that night when you looked left
And I looked right and we both grinned
Stayed out a little longer, found the fire a little stronger
Than we ever planned

And ooh, I got your number
I saw the lightning, felt the thunder
And we gave this thing one hell of a start
Yeah, these are our hearts
These are our hearts

Ooh, something about you
Something about me, something about us
Well, we didn't know that we could fall this hard
But we gave this thing one hell of a start
Picked up each other's pieces and parts
And said, "Hey baby, these are our hearts"
Yeah, these are our hearts
