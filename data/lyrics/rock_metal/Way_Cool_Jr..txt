Oh
Oh
New kid in town
Got fancy clothes
Old T-Bird car, baby
And you can tell he knows
He said, "Where is all the action in this town?"
Starts working on the women
Comes on real slick
Heard enough about sin, girl
Gonna make it stick
Hey! What makes him so special anyhow?
She said, "So good lookin', that's a fact
Steel guitar slung across his back"
The girls all know he's Way Cool Jr
Check him out on his good side
Heard he came from Memphis
Somewhere down south
Started hangin' with the blues crowd
That's how he got that crazy sound
What is all this talkin' goin' round?
She said, "So good lookin', turns me on"
Out all night, keeps me up 'til dawn"
The girls all know he's Way Cool Jr
You know you can't have fire without the flame
Can't keep the fortune without the fame
That's how he makes it when he's on his own
Way Cool Jr
He's gonna live it up or never live it down
Way Cool Jr
He's the hottest thing to ever hit this town
Go man go
She said, "So good lookin' and that's a fact
Steel guitar scratched off the back"
Everybody knows it's Way Cool Jr
You know you can't have fire without the flame
Can't keep the fortune without the fame
That's how he makes it when he's on his own
Way Cool Jr
Always comin' 'round now and then
Way Cool Jr
He's gonna live it up or never live it down
Way Cool Jr
Way Cool Jr
