<<<<<<< HEAD
Well, I am a shallow grave
I'm a holy ghost, whoa
I am that tidal wave that you'll miss most
Oh, so lonely, so sad
So vicious, so mad
Poor me, poor me
Well, I am that empty glass that you're sipping on
I am that cigarette that you're quitting on
Oh, so lonely, so sad
So vicious, so mad
Poor me, poor me

I like the steady rainfall, black and white movies
Oh oh, getting used to the pain, I think I might use it
Oh, poor me, poor me
Poor me, poor me
Yeah, poor me, poor me

I'm a bad habit that you can't shake
Oh, I'm a hip swinger
Oh, I'm an earthquake
So lonely, so sad
So vicious, so mad
Poor me, poor me, poor me
I am your Graceland
Oh, you're my saving grace, I swear
I'm only one man
Oh, I'm two-faced
So lonely, so sad
So vicious, so mad
Poor me, poor me, poor me

I like the steady rainfall, black and white movies
Getting used to the pain, I think I might use it
Oh, poor me, poor me

Dear Allan
As much as it pains me to say
I really fell in love with you
Why is it so hard for you to find balance between love and music?
Why does loving me mean the death of you?
I've experienced it first hand, your ability to love something more than music
You've now created the things that'll haunt you the most
Please, allow yourself to love again
For it may do the opposite of what you fear
You told me once that you believed love creates a respite of death
And I've struggled to understand the entrapment that you feel
Because I, too, fear death just as much as anyone else
Not just the physical sense of the word
But in the idea of what death represents
Dreams and aspirations becoming finite
I never wanted to be your demon
But you have made me this way
Your lack of compassion feeds my obsession
