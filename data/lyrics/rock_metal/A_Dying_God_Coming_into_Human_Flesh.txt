All is cold and frozen
Frozen the sea
Frozen the sky
Frozen is death
But I cannot die
Cannot die

As the snow falls
To cover this all
And all is cold
And cold, cold is all
All is cold, cold is all

Cold
Frozen
Frozen is heaven and frozen is hell
And I am dying in this living human shell

I am a dying God coming into human flesh
I am a dying God coming into human flesh
I am a dying God coming into human flesh
I am a dying God

Frozen my heart
Frozen my soul
Frozen my love

I am a dying God, coming into human flesh
I am a dying God, coming into human flesh
I am a dying God, coming into human flesh
I am a dying God, coming into human flesh
I am a dying God, coming into human flesh
I am a dying God, coming into human flesh
I am a dying God, coming into human flesh
