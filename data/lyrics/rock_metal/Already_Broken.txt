You can't break me cause I'm already broken
You can't break me cause I'm already broken
I'm already broken inside

I've seen so many bad things, I will never be the same
Taken too many times
It's hard to explain the pain
But I've grown and developed sense of sight
One that leads me to believe
Things can be alright
No me puedes quebrar porque estoy quebrado

You can’t break me, cause I’m already broken
(No me puedes quebrar)
You can’t break me, cause I’m already broken
(Porque estoy quebrado)

This moment marks the day I believe in me
Once a hollow shell now radiates infinity
I will become a new kind of entity
One that would be heard now and for centuries
You can’t break me, cause I’m already broken
(No me puedes quebrar)
You can’t break me, cause I’m already broken
(Porque estoy quebrado)

No more being played like this
I'm done
I'm numb from all the pain
No more, I didn't ask for this
I'm done
I'm moving on

You can't break me cause I'm already broken
You can't break me cause I'm already broken
I'm already broken
You can’t break me, cause I’m already broken
(No me puedes quebrar)
You can’t break me, cause I’m already broken
