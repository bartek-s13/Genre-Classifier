Overtired/overthink
Club nights and cheap drinks
Do you ever think of me the way I think about you?
Lately I知 on the brink
I stand up and slowly sink into the pavement below
If I ever die I値l have someone let you know, it was all your fault

Hiding with the boys in your bedroom
Hiding the evidence of dying youth under cigarettes and stale perfume

Approaching midnight in teenage twilight
Black hair and skinny jeans alert your parent痴 porch light
Oh, when we met last spring we had such a pretty thing
We fade like a Polaroid
I知 all the things you were taught to avoid
I知 clothes you never wear, I知 yours but you don稚 care

Hiding with the boys in your bedroom
Hiding the evidence of dying youth under cigarettes and stale perfume
Hiding with the boys in your bedroom
Hiding the evidence of dying youth under cigarettes and stale perfume
Hide, in your bedroom
Hide, in your bedroom
Hide, in your bedroom

Lie on your bed, lie through your teeth
Loving you is killing me
Loving you is killing me
Lie on your bed, lie to me
Loving you is killing me
Loving you is killing me
Lie on your bed, lie through your teeth
Loving you is killing me
Loving you is killing me
Lie on your bed, lie to me
Loving you is killing me
Loving you is killing me

Hiding with the boys in your bedroom
Hiding the evidence of dying youth under cigarettes and stale perfume
Hiding with the boys in your bedroom
Hiding the evidence of dying youth under cigarettes and stale perfume

Loving you is killing me
