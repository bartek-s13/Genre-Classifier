Take me back to my boat on the river
I need to go down, I need to come down
Take me back to my boat on the river
And I won't cry out any more

Time stands still as I gaze in her waters
She eases me down, touching me gently
With the waters that flow past my boat on the river
So I don't cry out anymore

Oh, the river is wise
The river, it touches my life like the waves on the sand
And all roads lead to Tranquility Base
Where the frown on my face disappears

Take me down to my boat on the river
And I won't cry out anymore

Oh, the river is deep
The river, it touches my life like the waves on the sand
And all roads lead to Tranquility Base
Where the frown on my face disappears, whoa
Take me down to my boat on the river
I need to go down, won't you let me go down
Take me back to my boat on the river
And I won't cry out anymore
And I won't cry out anymore
