Sweet child, in time, you'll see the line
The line that's drawn between good and bad
See the blind man shooting at the world
Bullets flying taking toll
If you've been bad, oh Lord, I bet you have
And you've not been hit by flying lead
You'd better close your eyes (Ooohhhh)
You'd better bow your head
Wait for the ricochet

Uhhh-uhhh-uhhh

Sweet child, in time, you'll see the line
I'll promise you,  between good and bad
See the blind man shooting at the world
Bullets flying taking toll
If you've been bad, Lord I bet you have
And you've not been hit by flying lead
You'd better close your eyes (Ooohhhh)
You'd better bow your head
Wait for the ricochet
