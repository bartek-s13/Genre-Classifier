Well, it's Christmas
And it's Hanukkah
Jews and Italians
Live very much alike
I like Italian food
Pete invited us to spend the weekend
With his mom and dad
And then they added us into the family
Pete's dad don't have cancer anymore
The doctor called and told him so, just before
We sat down
For Christmas supper
When he found out
We all cried a little
After supper we all gather
Around Pete's dad, he plays guitar
And sings serenades
From back in Sicily
On the wall there's a picture
Of a young man who looks like Peter does
Before he goes out on Saturday
Pete's dad don't have cancer anymore
The doctor called and told him so, just before
We sat down
For Christmas supper
When he found out
We all cried a little
It was one of those miracles
One of those miracles at Christmas
And Pete's dad don't have cancer anymore
The doctor called and told him so, just before
We sat down
For Christmas supper
When he found out
We all cried a little
It was one of those miracles
It was one of those miracles at Christmas
It was a miracle
It was a miracle
It was one of those miracles at Christmas
