Black Pontiac with a pocket of cash
Foot on the gas ready and throwing up a little dust
Like a pickup truck does in the mud
But ain’t nobody slowing us down right now
She said, "I need a little something with some get up and go
And nobody knows how to get me going quite like you do
When you do the things you do
Wanna give this sleepy podunk town something to talk about"
We were taillights fading from some blue lights chasing
Cut a path through the corn on County Road 44
Tore up a fence, jumped in a ditch, felt so good
We didn’t want it to end so we went
Looking for a dive just to kill some time
Let the heat cool off we could do us some dancing
Didn’t take long, just a couple of songs
You know it’s last call when the law comes walking in
So we were taillights fading from some blue lights chasing
Cut a path through the corn off County Road 44
Tore up a fence, jumped in a ditch, felt so good
We didn’t want it to end so we went
Rocking to the radio, fogging up the windows
Headlights off in a spot nobody else knows
We were taillights fading from some blue lights chasing
Cut a path through the corn on County Road 44
Tore up a fence, jumped in a ditch, felt so good
We didn’t want it to end
Black Pontiac with a pocket of cash
Foot on the gas ready and throwing up a little dust
Like a pick up truck does in the mud
But ain’t nobody slowing us down right now
