She really turned me over
Made to feel completely by surprise
I have found the love I needed all my life
And it's all right there in Melanie's eye
Listen to me
But she's been hurt before, so she's cruel to me
Until my thoughts pray that it seems
Though I've only known her for a few days
I love that girl forever in my dreams
Though it makes me wonder (wonder)
Should I show my love or hold it under? (under)
I might spoil my chance of making her love me
Melanie
Well, I know I made many mistakes before
And I'm so tired of ninety-five percent love
So I'm treating the situation carefully
I'm taking steps to attract your love
And though it makes me wonder (wonder)
Should I show my love or hold it under? (under)
I might spoil my chance of making her love me
Melanie
Though it makes me wonder (wonder)
Should I show my love or hold it under? Oh yeah
I might spoil my chance of making her love me
Melanie
Ooh Melanie, Melanie
Ooh yeah yeah
Though it makes me wonder (wonder)
Should I show my love or hold it under? Oh yeah
I might spoil my chance of making her love me
Melanie
