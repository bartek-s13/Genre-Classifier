Verse 1
Ain't a fire on the guilty place, the ghost is still inside me. I throw this bottle at the wall. When you fight fire with fire and not with ashes, alone nobody beside you. Nothing but an empty glass
Chorus
Walk with me, straight through the fire. I've been torn apart, born with a broken heart. Walk with me through the ashes of my life. I need a brand new start, born with a broken heart
Verse 2
Fake friends are shadows, are always near at your brightest moments, but nowhere at your darkest hours. And burns heart, back from trouble, chasing the demons in me. And my change is gonna come
Chorus
Bridge
I've been locked out of heaven for a long long time, for you try to control me. No more time to say goodbye
Chorus
Outro
I need a brand new start, born with a broken heart
