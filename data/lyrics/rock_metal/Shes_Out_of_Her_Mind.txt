I said, "Settle down, settle down, everything is fine
Take your eyes off the floor"
She said, "No, I'm not, no, I'm not, no, I'm not alright
I lost my head on the door"

She's a-a-a-antisocial, a-a-a-antisocial
A-a-and she's an angel, yeah

I'm in deep with this girl, but she's out of her mind
She said "Babe, I'm sorry, but I'm crazy tonight"
She got a black shirt, black skirt, and Bauhaus stuck in her head
I'm in deep with this girl, but she's out of her mind, oh yeah

We all need something to live for, oh yeah
We all need something to live for

She said, "I let her down, let her down, I no longer dream
Of anything anymore"
Said I'm a know-it-all, know-it-all, "You make me want to scream"
And threw herself on the floor
She's a-a-a-antisocial, a-a-a-antisocial
A-a-a she's an angel, yeah

I'm in deep with this girl, but she's out of her mind
She said "Babe, I'm sorry, but I'm crazy tonight"
She got a black shirt, black skirt, and Bauhaus stuck in her head
I'm in deep with this girl but she's out of her mind

She's not complicated, can't be overstated at all
She's not complicated-ated-ated at all

I'm in deep with this girl, but she's out of her mind
(She's out of her mind)
She said "Babe, I'm sorry but I'm crazy tonight"
She got a black shirt, black skirt, and Bauhaus stuck in her head
I'm in deep with this girl, but she's out of her mind, oh yeah

We all need something to live for, oh yeah
We all need something to live for
