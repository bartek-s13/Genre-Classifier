Don't cut out my paper heart
I ain't dying anyway
Take a look at Eiffel towers
Never trust them dirty liars
Sipping lemon yellow booze
Old lead-belly sings the blues
All dressed up on wedding day
Keep on tripping anyway

I am, I am
I said I'm not myself
But I'm not dead and I'm not for sale
So keep your bankroll lottery
Eat your salad day
Deathbed motorcade

Fake the heat and scratch the itch
Skinned up knees and salty lips
I'll breathe your life
Vicks vapor life
And when you binge
I purge alike, let go
It's harder holding on
One more trip and I'll be gone
So keep your head up, keep it on
Just a whisper, I'll be gone
Take a breath and make it big
It's the last you'll ever get
Break your neck with diamond noose
It's the last you'll ever choose
I am, I am I said I'm not myself
But I'm not dead
And I'm not for sale
Hold me closer, closer
Let me go
Let me be
Just let me be

I am, I am
I said I'm not myself
But I'm not dead and I'm not for sale
So keep your bankroll lottery
Eat your salad day
Deathbed motorcade


I am, I am
I said I'm not myself
But I'm not dead and I'm not for sale
So keep your bankroll lottery
Eat your salad day
Deathbed motorcade
