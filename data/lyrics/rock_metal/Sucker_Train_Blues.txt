<<<<<<< HEAD
Hands are shakin', got your finger on the trigger
Jesus ain't complainin', gonna figure it out
Somebody raped my tapeworm abortion
Come on, motherfucker, and deliver the cow

Brain and body melting while there's roaches multiplyin'
It's the alien infection, it's the comin' of Christ
All these sentimental halos and these consequential angels
While I'm runnin' with the Devil, don't deliver the fight

Don't look at me now
Fell too fast your wings won't hold
Don't look at me now
Fell too fast your wings won't hold

Yea, and when I want to
Yea, I will find you
Yea, and when I want to
Yea, I will blind you

Brains are frying while the kings and queens are dying
Satan won the race and the miracle mile
Somebody raped my tapeworm abortion
Come on, motherfuckers, and deliver the cow

Brain and body melting while there's roaches multiplyin'
It's the alien infection, it's the comin' of Christ
All these sentimental halos and these consequential angels
While I'm runnin' with the Devil don't deliver the fight

Don't look at me now
Fell too fast your wings won't hold
Don't look at me now
Fell too fast your wings won't hold

Yea, and when I want to
Yea, I will find you
Yea, and when I want to
Yea, I will blind you

It's all over me now
Let me go, let me go, let me go
And what's come over me now?
Let me go, let me go, let me go
It's all over me now
Let me go, let me go, let me go
And what's come over me now?

(Johnny sat at the old Oak tree
Cut off his hand, what did he see?
All of the animals are dead
The rats have crawled through his house
And out through their head
One of them ate a hole in the sky
To believe this would be a fate worse than dying)

Yea, and when I want to
Yea, I will find you
Yea, and when I want to
Yea, I will blind you
Yea
(Johnny sat at the old Oak tree
Cut off his hand, what did he see?
- I will find you -
All of the animals are dead
The rats have crawled through his house
And out through their head
One of them ate a hole in the sky
To believe this would be a fate worse than dying)
