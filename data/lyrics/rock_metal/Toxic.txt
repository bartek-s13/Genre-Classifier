<<<<<<< HEAD
Now Baby, can't you see, I'm calling
A lady like you should wear a warnin'
It's dangerous, I'm fallin'
And there's no escape, I can't wait
I need a hit, baby, give me it
You're dangerous, I'm lovin' it

Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinning 'round and 'round
Do you feel me now?

With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
Taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Baby yeah
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
Taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
I'm addicted to you, yeah
And I love what you do

It's getting late to give you up
I took a sip from my devil's cup
Slowly, It's taking over me

Too high, can't come down
It's in the air and it's all around
Can you feel me now?

With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
Taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
Taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you

Too high, can't come down
Losing my head
Spinning 'round and 'round
Do you feel me now?

(Taste of your lips I'm on a ride)
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
Taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Baby, yeah
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
Taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
