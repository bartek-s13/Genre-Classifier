You moved away
Sadly not far enough for you to stay off my mind
I took out an ad in the "lonely hearts" section
It read "Don't come back"

But baby, now we know the world is ending
And there's no point in us pretending not to want to disappear
Some days I lace my coffee with poison just to feel the hit
And I've been cheating death for years

So you're leaving, I ain't grieving
'Cause darling, we all die alone
You're sick of me now
And I can't blame you
I'm sick of myself too

Remember when we sat on bumper cars at 3 a.m. in warm weather?
Broken apart, but I thought we'd be better broken together

But baby, now we know the world is ending
And there's no point in us pretending not to want to disappear
But I still lace my coffee with poison just to feel the hit
And I've been cheating death for years

So you're leaving, I ain't grieving
'Cause darling, we all die alone
You're sick of me now
And I can't blame you
I'm sick of myself too

The sky falls, I don't really care at all
You know everything about me
So I'm still praying for a comet to wipe out everything I promised you

So you're leaving, I ain't grieving
'Cause darling, we all die alone
You're sick of me now
And I can't blame you
I'm sick of myself too

So you're leaving, I ain't grieving
'Cause darling, we all die alone
You're sick of me now
And I can't blame you
I'm sick of myself too
So you're leaving, I ain't grieving
'Cause darling, we all die alone
You're sick of me now
And I can't blame you
I'm sick of myself too
