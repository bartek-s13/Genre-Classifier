Tell everybody I'm on my way
New friends and new places to see
With blue skies ahead
Yes, I'm on my way
And there's nowhere else that I'd rather be
Tell everybody I'm on my way
And I'm lovin' every step I take
With the sun beating down
Yes, I'm on my way
And I can't keep this smile off my face
'Cause there's nothing like seeing each other again
No matter what the distance between
And the stories that we tell will make you smile
Oh it really lifts my heart
So tell 'em all I'm on my way
New friends and new places to see
And to sleep under the stars
Who could ask for more?
With the moon keeping watch over me
Not the snow, not the rain, can change my mind
The sun will come out wait and see
And the feeling of the wind in your face can lift your heart
Whoa, there's nowhere I would rather be
'Cause I'm on my way now
Well and truly
I'm on my way now
(whistling)
(I'm on my way now)
(I'm on my way now)
(I'm on my way now)
Tell everybody I'm on my way
(I'm on my way)
And I just can't wait to be there
(Just can't wait to be there)
With blue skies ahead
Yes, I'm on my way
And nothing but good times to share
So tell everybody I'm on my way
And I just can't wait to be home
(Just can't wait to be home)
With the sun beating down
Yes, I'm on my way
And nothing but good times to show
I'm on my way
