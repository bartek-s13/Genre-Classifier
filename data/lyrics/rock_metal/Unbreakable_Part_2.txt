Born to lead, there's no defeat
Midnight hour, time is standing still
Do you understand my whisper?
Do you hear the wind shout? No good will
Shadow's haunted, eagles fly
History repeats, what you fear most
Bullets fly and blood runs cold
I'm your evil nightmare, I'm your ghost
Raise your fist, walk with me through the fire
Come with me through the heaven and hell
Chroming wheels, thunder roars
We fight demons and war
You will see, it's all true in the end
Raise your fist, walk with me through the fire
Come with me through the heaven and hell
Chroming wheels, thunder roars
We fight demons and war
We were born to raise some hell
You'll be shattered deep inside
And all your primal fear is on the rise
Then all hell is breaking loose
You've been left out in the cold and ice
Out of hell into the sun
There is no tomorrow, you can run
No revenge, no liberty
You can hear a bullet and a gun
Raise your fist, walk with me through the fire
Come with me through the heaven and hell
Chroming wheels, thunder roars
We fight demons and war
You will see, it's all true in the end
Raise your fist, walk with me through the fire
Come with me through the heaven and hell
Chroming wheels, thunder roars
We fight demons and war
We were born to raise some hell
