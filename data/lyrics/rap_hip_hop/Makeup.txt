<<<<<<< HEAD
Your makeup stained my favorite jeans
I ain't washed them in weeks
Scratch your name in the seams
It’s hard now knowing you're not around
Knowing you are not down
Fucking head in the clouds
Your silence speaks as loud as my screams
I've been missing for weeks
And still soundly you sleep (But it’s alright)
But I've been missing you for so many years (But it's alright)
Babe, I've been missing you for so many years (But it's alright)
Know you've been missing me through so many tears (But it's alright)
Know you've been missing, you’ve been facing your fears (But it’s alright)
(But it's alright)

Over now
Cold shoulder now
Can’t remember to call sometimes
But that don't really mean you ain't on my mind
But every word that you say now is blasphemy
All you are is a blast from the past to me
I ain't mean it like that, you just bad for me
Old regrets, just leave it in the past for me
Ended love, that shit had me beat down
Ended up stuck in a beach town
Now I’ve been missing you
For so many years now
Your makeup stained my favorite jeans
I ain't washed them in weeks
Scratch your name in the seams
It's hard now knowing you're not around
Knowing you are not down
Fucking head in the clouds
Your silence speaks as loud as my screams
I've been missing for weeks
And still soundly you sleep (But it's alright)
But I've been missing you for so many years (But it's alright)
Babe, I've been missing you for so many years (But it's alright)
Know you've been missing me through so many tears (But it's alright)
Know you've been missing, you've been facing your fears (But it's alright)

(But it's alright)
(But it's alright)
