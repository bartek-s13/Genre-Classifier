Uh, Ray Dawn
Beedie
Pittsburgh
Three Rivers uh, see the waves
Wave
Yeah

I had a very vivid vision went and got busy
Why’d he quit law school the dude’s so, witty
Cause I saved me eighty grand I’m in command of my dream
I wake up in the morning drink my coffee wit some cream
Iron my jeans without a crease see, my fresh’ll never cease
I’m sailin’ overseas smoke reef we chiefin’
The ocean breeze I keep my aces up my sleeves
Keep all my receipts got, New Balance 420s coverin’ my feet
Plot the course north course sharks don’t sleep
LBJ jays sink tre’s all week
You can smell it in my sneaks I got your ankles feelin’ weak
Baby girl before you faint, will you have a seat
You can let your heart speak, do you mind a little weed
Let me sweep you off your feet, like the Bulls in ‘93
Tell the other fool to leave, he ain’t even on my level
He ain’t the type a brotha you bring around ya ghetto

We on the rise like the bubbles from the ocean floor
Swimming thru the water like the land is what we comin for

Wavy
Yo, uh
Crossin the ocean like I'm coastin from the coast to dock
With soakin socks
Walkin on the water like I'm sposed to drop
Twice a year, I'm focused ahk
On the rise, that's no surprise
I go inside, my flow reside
Like runnin water… Purified
Still underground. Under seas
Like Sebastian, so fuck wit me
Or Steven Segal. Under Siege
See the seagulls? Birds that breeze
Ya girl got meat like a flounder
Look at them cheeks, I'ma pound her
But it's a big sea around her, around her
Ayo
Plenty fish on that shark shit
Soon as they heard I'm a star fish
Been pushin weight like a barge ship
Smoke coral reef in my apartment
It's always something exotic
Mind, body and soul groovin
Rollin deep, like a school of fish
My medulla sick, I'm gon lose it
We out here, tryna find Nemo
Most a my friends found the needle
You never know what's in the deep though
Some fish a fuckin freak show…
Word to The Beatles, going deep in my submarine
Look at my shit bubbling…. Crown me the fuckin king


We on the rise like the bubbles from the ocean floor
Swimming through the water like the land is what we comin for

Yeah
We on the rise like the bubbles from the ocean floor
Let ‘em know
Views from the top floor ocean so beautiful

Wave, wave, wave, wave
Wave, wave, wave, wave
Wave, wave, wave, wave
Wave, wave, wave, wave, uh
