If Rover made it it’s a banger
(Vitals on the track)

(Ah) I’m trying to tell you all the things no one told you
I’m trying give you all my love like I’m supposed to
I know you feel a part of me when I hold you
The way I’m moving baby I might control you
Take it all too
Do the things I make them niggas get on you
I won’t cross you
If I lost you
It would hurt me big so let’s make a post move
I wanna know
I wanna know how you just did it
And kept that pussy dripping felt like i’m washing the dishes
I swear I miss it so much I feel like I’m just a diggin’
And I can’t show no feelings baby so I keep my distance

DTB I don’t trust bitches
I got trust issues
It’s gonna take a minute before I can fuck with you
So appreciate it if I show love to you
Cause’ there are plenty bitches that wish I ain’t fuck with you
I wanna know
I wanna know
I wanna know
Should I hold on all this pain and let you go
Or should I find another bitch and hit the road
Or should I hit you were it hurt and hit your soul
I wanna know
I wanna know
I wanna know
Should I hold on all this pain and let it go
Or should I hit you were it hurt and hit your soul
Or should I find another bitch and hit the road

DTB I don’t trust bitches
