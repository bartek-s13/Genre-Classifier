{Intro}
Here's the shit I can't explain
My niggas dodging their arraignment
Took the rental out of state
Here's some shit I can't explain
Aye.. Aye...

Here's some shit I can't explain
My niggas dodging their arraignments
We took the rental out of state
Migrated to trapping location
Crooked 12s took some drugs from us
Left my niggas on the road
We took them loses, how that go
Cause we just sticking to the code
Now here's some things I can't explain
This flat just knock me out my brain
Your bitch just hit me up again
I'll leave that to her to explain
As long as I'm still with the gang
As long as I don't ever change
There's nothing left that needs explaining
There's nothing left that needs explaining

Told these niggas I ain't playing
They always think it's a game
I'm just living what I'm saying
Still got shooters like the range
I don't ever be complaining
You be throwing allegations
Kush and money got me fragrance
I'm your favorite's favorite, favorite's favorite
Yeah I had to bring them O's with me
Brought the work to all the shows with me
Brought my niggas from the hood with me
Told my niggas they all good with me
My cousin riding with a full semi
And they all wish a nigga would with me
All these rappers think they knew stizzy
But they just bringing out the bool in me
Here's some shit I can't explain
My niggas dodging their arraignments
We took the rental out of state
Migrated to trapping location
Crooked 12s took some drugs from us
Left my niggas on the road
We took them loses, how that go
Cause we just sticking to the code
Now here's some things I can't explain
This {flat?} just knock me out my brain
Your bitch just hit me up again
I'll leave that to her to explain
As long as I'm still with the gang
As long as I don't ever change
There's nothing left that needs explaining
There's nothing left that needs explaining


100-something on the highway
I'm doing numbers still my way
We party like it's a Friday
You just look funny like Friday
Smoking like every day high day
Leaning like I had my thigh break
Niggas can't reach up to my space
Because they're more old news than myspace
Invited your bitch out to my place
All for that throat imma violate
I got my own on my mine man
All of this stress give me migraines
This ain't the time to be shy baby
You can hop out of this ride baby
Ahead of my time but far from my prime
I know the world gon' be my baby

Here's some shit I can't explain
My niggas dodging their arraignments
We took the rental out of state
Migrated to trapping location
Crooked 12s took some drugs from us
Left my niggas on the road
We took them loses, how that go
Cause we just sticking to the code
Now here's some things I can't explain

As long as I don't ever change
There's nothing left that needs explaining
There's nothing left that needs explaining
