<<<<<<< HEAD
Could you turn it up a ‘lil bit?
Yeah
I got ‘em on right now matter fact
NB 420s

I used to have doubts, I used to lose sleep
Now I’m sleeping like a baby got the thickest concrete
I don’t hear the doubters speak, not a single peep
I’ll never forget what they said I got all the receipts
I’m standn’ on my own feet, you bitches need stilts
All your views bought cause you got no skills
Don’t know to follow first before askin’ if we can build
Don’t acknowledge your presence get the message you feel
Play with an open wound then the cut’ll never heal
It’s nothin’ personal my person can’t fuck with what isn’t real
It’s not about a deal it’s about doin’ what I love
Ray Dawn shrug
See I keep my people positive no need to mean mug
A few milli in the bank you’ll never see me in the club
Don’t take it as a snub bruh, go and pop bottles
Order moscato for hollow next top models kaaaay

Ain’t a damn thing funny
Everyday the same thing you gotta make money
Get money
Yet it still feels lovely gettin’ paid in the same New Balance 420s
Get money
I gotta make money gotta gotta make bucks
You see nothin’ came lucky I been workin’ til dusk
Earned what I got hush grindin’ is a must
Plus every touch a touchdown my punter don’t punt
Never split a dutch, gotta roll RedTape
Transparencies a really good trait
This a really good drink potato vodka on the rocks
Watch two years from now my whole team’ll have yachts
Four years from now their own team’ll have yachts
Six years from now their team’s team’ll have yachts
That’s a whole lotta yachts, whole lotta guap
That’s a whole lotta top baby girl don’t stop
Mop ‘til it pop girl finish yo plate
I don’t wanna see a single drop on your pretty face
Head back to my place so I can count this money
Please feel free to slip in somethin’ more comfy


Always on my job got damn I’m goin’ hard
Why settle for a yard when you can go and get a yacht
Visit anywhere you want, I’ma see the whole world
Be a culinary visionary cook it for your girl
Marinate I’m barely lit I need a lotta reefer
Rolled nicely for our visit we ‘gon see the Coliseum
Slide up in Roman, gotta wear a Trojan
Invade the Billboard they never saw me comin’
Law school dropout my Klout score jumpin’
Iced latte fresh blueberry muffin
Got it for the love cashier want some cuttin’
So I gave her my number life’s short fuck the fronitn’
Later that night she came over we was fuckin’
And her head so good my B- squared can keep buzzin’
Smokin’ on some Irish got both our vision Dublin
