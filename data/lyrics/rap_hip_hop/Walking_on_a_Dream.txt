Three things will last forever
Faith, hope, and love
And the greatest of these is love
Yeah

Yeah, faith I believe it
Me and you were meant to be
That's perfect chemistry
I'm the land, you're the sea
Love is infinite like the ring around your finger
Your lips got me singing
Never thought I'd be a singer

We are always running for the thrill of it
Thrill of it (let's go)
Always pushing up the hill
Searching for the thrill of it
On and on and on we are calling out loud again
Never looking down I'm just in awe of what's in front of me

Is it real now
When two people become one
I can feel it
When two people become one
She is like the sunshine
Her eyes are like the stars
There's magic in that smile girl
Your looks could start a war
That's real talk and one kiss could make my heart stop
You don't need no dress and high heels
You so fine in tees and flip flops
And I'm not gone break you down
I'll build you up and lift you up
And God's love is in both of us
So we can fill each other's cups

We are always running for the thrill of it
Thrill of it (let's go)
Always pushing up the hill searching for the thrill of it
On and on and on we calling out loud again
Never looking down I'm just in awe of what's in front of me

Is it real now
When two people become one
I can feel it
When two people become one
Is it real now
When two people become one
I can feel it
When two people become one
Catch me I'm falling
For you I'm calling
Catch me I'm falling down
For you I'm calling
Catch me I'm falling down
For you I'm calling
Catch me I'm falling down
For you I'm calling out

Don't stop (don't stop) just keep going on
I'm your (I'm your) shoulder, lean upon
So come on (come on), deliver from inside
All we got is tonight
That is right 'til first light

Is it real now
When two people become one
I can feel it
When two people become one
Is it real now
When two people become one
I can feel it
When two people become one
