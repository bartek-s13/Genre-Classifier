Can't breathe, oh, I'm fine, cut deep, oh
Why should I care
Gone, gone, gone

Never knew calm, I can't help
180, I'll turn back, send the
Addy in the car, addy in the car
Ain't shit change, if it did, I can't tell
Make me stay no more, it ends, next to
Amy's grave, with the prayer hands
And the shaky legs, still panicking
Won't you take me away? Take me away
And I'll stay inside in case it rains (Yeah)
Tank full of sharks like the hoodie, BAPE (Yeah)
Shifting shapes, and changing friends
But the circle tight, like a wedding band (Uh)

No longer mind if I go
You pray enough, I might fall
Down, down, down, down, down (Might fall down)
Why should I care what happens to me?
Why should I care what happens to me?
Follow my lead, in casket I'll sleep
With the bottle by feet, passing out cold (Way up)
Count it up at times, follow me to say
Addy in the car, addy in the car
I don't wanna talk, I don't wanna talk
And she said "I'm not falling, I'll live"
Keep me right at bay, I'm seasick
Quit reaching, come this far and you'll trip
Quit reaching for those stars, I can't catch
One reason, cut 'em off like your wrist
Stay inside, stay inside

Stay inside, stay inside (Rather stay)
Count it up at times

No longer mind if I go
You pray enough, I might fall
Down, down, down, down, down (Might fall down)
Why should I care what happens to me?
Why should I care what happens to me?
Follow my lead, in casket I'll sleep
With the bottle by feet, passing out cold
