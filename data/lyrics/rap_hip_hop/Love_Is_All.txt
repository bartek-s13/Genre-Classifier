Love is everlasting
Love is only kind
Love is always patient
Love will blow your mind
If you let it, oh
If you let it, oh
If you let it, oh
If you let it, oh

Go on and give it to 'em
I'm gonna give it to 'em
Gonna make sure that y'all know that we can change this place
Love is the answer, open your heart
Do something for someone and that's a good start
Love, love is all we need
We find that, we find everything
So to Republicans, and to the Democrats
I don't care who you are, I don't care where you're at
As long as you're breathing, y'all my brother
Mi casa su casa, my momma yo momma
We all two dashes, I call that equal
White or brown skinned, y'all all my people
I pray for revolution, I know you wanna rise up
Past the color lines that still divide us
And hate wanna try us
And hate wanna fry us
But hate can eat my dust
Love is everlasting
Love is only kind
Love is always patient
Love will blow your mind
If you let it, oh
If you let it, oh
If you let it, oh
If you let it, oh

Love, where do i go from here?
I need something that will wash away my tears
I wanna find love
I'm lookin' for love
I need to find love
Where do they hide love?
We gotta just love, gotta just care
Even when some thing in life don't seem fair
Never give up, never you quit
Never say never and never won't get
The best of you in them hard times you rock and roll
And love let it save your soul
The best of you in them hard time you rock and roll
And love let it save your soul
Love is everlasting
Love is only kind
Love is always patient
Love will blow your mind
If you let it, oh
If you let it, oh
If you let it, oh
If you let it, oh

So how do we escape from inside this prison?
Build your relation. Kill your religion
There's thirty-eight thousand versions of Christian
Twisting the Word to fit how they are livin'
Heaven help us live like we're saved
In one hand the truth, in the other the grave
One hand is free and the other's a slave
Love is the key to lock hate in the cage!

Love is everlasting
Love is only kind
Love is always patient
Love will blow your mind
If you let it, oh
If you let it, oh
If you let it, oh
If you let it, oh
Love is everlasting (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Only kind (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Always patient
Love will blow your mind
If you let it, oh
If you let it, oh
If you let it, oh
If you let it, oh
