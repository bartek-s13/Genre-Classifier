In a dark hole
I wanna know if you can tango

I was by myself
In a dark hole
Riding with no lights
On a dark road
Feeling like a wake
In them dark clothes
I was locked outside
With the door closed
Now I知 inside
With all of these foreign hoes
High beam
In a beam
Rocking camo
Big booties twerking
Wanna see that thing go
I wanna know if you can tango

Come and dance with me
You know you wanna come and blow a couple bands with me
Couple hundreds and a couple fifties
I got a couple bad bitches and they rolling with me
I swear they getting filthy
Bitches kissing bitches and they sucking titties
You know l love it
Making shit nasty when in public
Bitches coming in, in abundance
Smoking on the woods, Issa substance
Bitches wanna know where the blunt is
Cheifing on that shit like it痴 nothing
Sipping on that act, it ain't tussin
Bitches wanna know where the love is
Bitches wanna know where the drugs is
Dancing with the devil like fuck it
I was by myself
In a dark hole
Riding with no lights
On a dark road
Feeling like a wake
In them dark clothes
I was locked outside
With the door closed
Now I知 inside
With all of these foreign hoes
High beam
In a beam
Rocking camo
Big booties twerkin
Wanna see that thing go
I wanna know if you can tango

Tango
Kill the pussy like I知 Rambo
Bad hoes
All we got is fucking bad hoes
Bad foes
All these pussy niggas baffled
Sad woes
Getting money like a raffle
Getting change lil nigga
People always ask me
Why I changed my nigga
I ain't change my nigga
I just ride off in mulsannes my nigga
I was by myself
In a dark hole
Riding with no lights
On a dark road
Feeling like a wake
In them dark clothes
I was locked outside
With the door closed
Now I知 inside
With all of these foreign hoes
High beam
In a beam
Rocking camo
Big booties twerking
Wanna see that thing go
I wanna know if you can tango

Come and dance with me
Blow a couple bands with me
