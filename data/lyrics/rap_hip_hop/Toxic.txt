You love the toxicity
But that ain’t for me
You left me to bleed
I can’t even breath
Seen some shit, don’t wanna see
In too deep, wish I could leave
I been searching for some peace
Starting to feel like I’m deceased

Don’t know what I want with you
Know I love you but you act brand new
Might just only love the way you move
Shouldn’t be wasting all my time on you
I get faded when my mind on you
I just hate it when my mind on you
Agitated when my mind on you
I’m deflated drew the line right through
Like nowadays I don’t know
I been feeling alone, I do better alone, put a plane on the phone
Ima drown till I’m gon, ima roll up a cone, Ima do what I want
I get used to ya tone, I got broke like a bone, no it cannot be sewn
What’s the price of a soul? Guess I’ll go on the road, only time gonna show
Love where I’m going but I hate this feeling
Everyone thinks being sad’s appealing
Praying to god need help I’m kneeling
When I look up all I see is the ceiling
Wood full of boof and a cup is healing
Now I’m fucked up and it’s fuck this feeling
Listen real close it’ll be revealing
Listen real close it’ll be revealing
Love where I’m going but I hate this feeling
Everyone thinks being sad’s appealing
Praying to god need help I’m kneeling
When I look up all I see is the ceiling
Wood full of boof and a cup is healing
Now I’m fucked up and it’s fuck this feeling
Listen real close it’ll be revealing
Listen real close it’ll be revealing

You love the toxicity
But that ain’t for me
You left me to bleed
I can’t even breath
Seen some shit, don’t wanna see
In too deep wish, I could leave
I been searching for some peace
