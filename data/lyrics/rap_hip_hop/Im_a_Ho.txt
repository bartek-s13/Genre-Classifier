I'm ready
(here we go)
Yo, Donkey?
(Yo whassup man?)
Yo what's happening tonight, man?
(I'm goin' to check out a few skeezers over there, know what I知 saying?)
Yo, man I seen a lot of skeezers in this place tonight, man
(I know I'm ready to do the wild thing, know what I知 saying?)
(And, and, and, it goes a little something like this)

Some say it's an art, some say it's a shame
You would give me your body, before your name
But I'm a jigga-high, and I'm a gigolo
I'm a jigga wherever it can go
So later on don't act like you don't know
When I pick out the freaks in the front row
I'm the rapper J, that's the rapper Ex
We're known for playing tag team sex
When I get you in the house, you know what I do
Well, let me tell you a story that's definitely true
When I came to the party I was by myself
Nine times out of ten I'll leave with someone else
It's something about the way I rock the microphone
The ladies in the place wanna take me home
Stretch me out all along the couch
And show me what good lovin' is all about
So when I get 'em, then I let 'em
I throw my jimmy on the top and then I wet 'em
'Cause I'm a ho, you know I'm a ho
I rock three different freaks after every show
'Cause I'm a ho, you know I'm a ho
How do you know, because I told you so

Now the lover of many I just may be
But I'll never touch another man's property
So if you got a little momma, you wanna keep her neat
Then keep the little freak off my street
Because if she comes knocking at my door
It's my duty to give her what she came here for
What can I say? That's the life I live
Now how's your wife and my kid

'Cause I'm a ho, you know I'm a ho
I rock three different freaks after every show
'Cause I'm a ho, you know I'm a ho
How do you know, because I told you so

Now if I knock on your door you should open it up
You wanna know who it is, the neighborhood slutbuster
Been rocking freaks, all through the week
Now when I say freaks, I mean the ones with the sneaks
I mean the ones with the nerve, the ones with the guts
To call me a ho when they're giving it up
So I think it's about time you all learned a lesson
Slutbusters is our new profession
'Cause I'm a ho, you know I'm a ho
I rock three different freaks after every show
'Cause I'm a ho, you know I'm a ho
How do you know, because I told you so

A-dicky-dicky-dicky-dicky-dicky-dick-what?
A-dicky-dicky-dicky-dicky-dicky-dick-who?

Now if knock on your door, you should open it up
You wanna know who it is, the neighborhood slutbuster
Been rocking freaks, all through the week
Now when I say freaks, I mean the ones with the sneaks
