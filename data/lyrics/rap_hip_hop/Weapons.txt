These the new chapters

I said fuck all these weapons
And fuck my depression, fuck these recessions
And fuck the election
Learning my lessons and counting my blessings
Vibes dropping straight out of heaven
Top drop, oceans eleven
Why they gotta question, even though they know heaven sent 'em?
Fuck all these weapons, and fuck the recessions
I just be counting my  blessings
'Cause I'm a space kid astronaut
Whether or not I'm gonna pass ya is not the question I'm askin'
I'm askin' when I'll get drafted
Making music till they asking like "Who's he?"
Passing all these women like Drew Brees
Get up out my hooptie
I'm loyal to my city
Not like KD on some new teams
I put on for my family cause we hanging on like shoe strings
Changed my habits up and now it's feeling like a mood ring
Now it's feeling like a mood ring
I been intellectual, I gotta get my dream on
It's me, my girl, a million bucks
I gotta put my team on
And when this shit starts getting tough, boy who you gonna lean on?
Fuck dreaming, never sleeping, making waves, Katrina
I never took a pill but now I'm limitless
However my endeavor getting kills like it was "Finish Him"
Enlightened like the minister
Said you would only hit it, now  you missing her
You shed a couple tears every time you smell conditioner

I said fuck all these weapons
And fuck my depression, fuck these recessions
And fuck the election
Learning my lessons and counting my blessings
Vibes dropping straight out of heaven
Top drop, oceans eleven
Why they gotta question, even though they know heaven sent 'em?
Fuck all these weapons, and fuck the recessions
I just be counting my  blessings
How the hell is my music unoriginal?
My DNA is digital
My vision is so peripheral
I don't waste no breath away, so write it like it's scriptural
Republican or Liberal, the difference is so minimal
'Cause as my power progressin'
Potential deadly weapons possessing
So they gonna send him, you check the referendum
I'm scoring in the end zone
You boring you in the friend zone
Dreaming, snoring for that foreign
Mother fucker got froze from recording

I said fuck all these weapons
And fuck my depression, fuck these recessions
And fuck the election
Learning my lessons and counting my blessings
Vibes dropping straight out of heaven
Top drop, oceans eleven
Why they gotta question, even though they know heaven sent 'em?
Fuck all these weapons, and fuck the recessions
I just be counting my  blessings
