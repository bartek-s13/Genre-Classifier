Verse 1:
Goddamn, what do I do…Lost and so confused
It's like you wrote the rules and then you broke ‘em too and then you broke into
Another post to prove, I was nothing but another joke to you
Thought I was a pro but I spoke too soon, I guess I’m minor league
Evidence of you is a sign to me that it's nothing new no
Biology doesn't explain the  source of  my pain
Is the space in between these lines inscribing my name
On irons and chains that tie to this game
Thought I could read, thought I was a beast when I feast I feed
And when you cease to resist we persist to seize
A kind of lease on your lips, but the kiss I keep, this I.V. provides me
With divine interference interfering with the with the pheromones
And the serotonin in her tone underwritten, everywhere I’m tripping
And apparently I'm wrong
And I'm bearing this unknown, in the glaring mist I'm home
And you can carry this until we're buried with this arrogance alone, and…
Chorus:
I keep trying, I keep moving
Scared to see you, where this will go
But I keep trying, I keep moving
So indecisive and so damn confused
But I keep trying, I keep moving
Baby why can't you just tell me what to do
Oh tell me what to do
Just tell me what to do
Verse 2:
And I can tell that you really want to flip, that you seek an assist to desist
That this meek existence just no longer fits, so you reach and open my fist
Hope that you never made the list, top ten offended that I most regretted
When I close connection that's it
And I can feel it in the pit of my stomach, I've gotta rummage through the ruckus
And the sewers and the tunnels and maneuver through manure that you spit in your rebuttals
Don’t talk a lot of shit, when you do its so subtle
Hell of a grip in this tug of war struggle
Irrelevant if we don’t ever say I love you
Say you want sex but you really wanna cuddle
And you've got a lot of “yets” but you don’t live inside a bubble, no
And I already know, no you ain't gotta say it you were violated
Dosed up at the bar and dialated, some asshole left a scar and silent pain that
Crime never charged so he got away, shit…
What I wouldn't do just to confiscate it this abomination…
I could give you life but you've got to take it
Chorus
