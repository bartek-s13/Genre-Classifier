Is a question of strength,
of unshed tears,
of being trampled under,
and always, always,
remembering you are human.
Look deep to find the grains of hope and strength,
and sing, my brothers and sisters,
and sing. The sun will share
your birthdays with you behind bars,
the new spring grass
like fiery spears will count your years,
as you start into the next year;
