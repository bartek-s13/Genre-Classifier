Whether right or wrong
I don't know but I might know something
And the night gonna come
And the light gets on like a silly old song
(Repeat)
Baegod Verse:
We on a Late night vibe
We live a late night life
Wait till’ we come to light
See what we made shine bright
Nobody feels the way that I do about you
It's better if not, for both of us
It's better if we speaking
We better find the mole if we leaking, ohh
Come through with the rhythm on slay
We do but we're never gonna say that
You thought but it wasn't that way
Worked up but we're never gonna pay that
Bring that cause I'm ready for it
Make use all time man we 24 here
Chase that like the Henny gone kick
Due time hit back all facts
They ain't ready for that no
Sbvce:
Lit tonight, we got it lit tonight
I just wanna mystify you
Give you that misses title
Left the one that made you tight
Had you all afraid of life
Momma help me pop this bottle
I really Identify
Whether right or wrong
I don't know but I might know something
And the night gonna come
And the light gets on like a silly old song
(Repeat)
Baegod:
We at an all time high
Not even touch the sky
We've been walking all these lines
Believing it's gonna pay in time
Maybe it will maybe it won't
Daily we bread, havin’ a fun
2 on a bag it's better than one
It's better than sex, it's bigger than love
Building em up, making em’ come
Waking them up yeah
Come through with the rhythm on slay
We do but we're never gonna say that
You thought but it wasn't that way
Worked up but we're never gonna pay that
Bring that cause I'm ready for it
Make use all time man we 24 here
Chase that like the Henny gone kick
Due time, hit back, all facts
They ain't ready for that no
Whether right or wrong
I don't know but I might know something
And the night gonna come
And the light gets on like a silly old song
(Repeat)
Outro:
On the late night
