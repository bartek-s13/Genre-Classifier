On God

This world is so full of greed
So I gotta get what I need
She giving me head in the Lamb
So I gotta slow down my speed
And now that I gotta her undressin'
From all of these angles her body impressive
Not saying I'm mad but she really aggressive
If you say I hit then I guess that you guessed it
This money I make (ayy)
I think I still need a raise (ayy)
I'm rockin' four or more chains (ayy)
I spent 1k one the shade (ayy)
These people sayin' I've changed (ayy)
I know, I'm changing the game (ayy)
I am the one you should thank (ayy)
I am the one you should thank (ayy)
It's easy to see that they wanna catch up but they can't (ayy)
I got the cash in the safe (ayy)
I got them M's in the bank (ayy)
My girl's ass look like a tank (ayy)
Rico, he sippin' that drank (ayy)
My homies be off the dank (ayy)
That's why they never awake

My diamonds drippin' like it's water
Ayy, you say you working, working harder
I be rockin' J's, no designer
My homie strapped up, like a condom
I be sipping Ciroc on the rocks
Got so much drip in this watch
The light, it be hitting my wrist and it pop
Even from a distance, they watch
They tryna figure it out

Ayy, I made a mil' in a week (ayy)
I know that stunt is unique (ayy)
That's all that matters to me (ayy)
All of my girls is petite (ayy)
I got a bed on my ting (ayy)
They like having sex on the beach (ayy)
Right on the beach I'ma be (ayy)
All of this talking, I know that they talking 'bout me (ayy)
You bought a chain it was geeked (ayy)
I spent ten bands on my teeth (ayy)
My chain costs more than your lease (ayy)
My chain costs more than your lease (ayy)
I don't see how you compete (ayy)
That talking it must be discreet

My diamonds drippin' like it's water
Ayy, you say you working, working harder
I be rockin' J's, no designer
My homie strapped up, like a condom
I be sipping Ciroc on the rocks
Got so much drip in this watch
The light, it be hitting my wrist and it pop
Even from a distance, they watch
They tryna figure it out
