CHORUS
In the kitchen trying to stretch a 4 into an (aye)
No, I ain't no coach but call my phone and get a play (aye)
Look here lil bitch you ain't my girl you ain't my babe (aye)
No, this dick ain't free so when we fuck you gotta pay (aye)
Killas with me they gone do exactly what I say
Killas with me point a finger that's where they gone spray aye
See them sparkles know them bottle on the way
You do this once a month my we do this every day (aye)
VERSE I
This ain't nothing new
Hoes come by the groups
Stretch up 4 from deuce
Whip that white like roots
Killas with me where I point they shoot (aye)
Bullets fly u better duck duck just like goose (aye)
Ask yo bitch she know who got the juice she know who got the juice
On tape u no we got the proof
We fucked her sew in loose
A nigga ball so much they think we hoop
But we don't hoop we call the plays
Ps fa X's 0's fa 0's
Pull up to the club my nigga buy the way
Car gone park itself don't need to get valet
Tell em bring the bottles nigga they obey
Plus my diamonds look like water boy just call Lil Sleep Boucher (aye)
CHORUS

Killas with me point a finger that's where they gone spray (aye)
See them sparkles know them bottle on the way

VERSE II

Hustling niggas with me they gone get it every day
Bitches with me they gone do exactly what I say
Got a bitch in every city every state
You know I got that play just hit me up you on the way (aye)
In the kitchen, I'm whipping like Rachel ray
And I come for that money like Sally May
It's a movie my shooter shoot at you one take
Point a finger my shooters popping you point blank
