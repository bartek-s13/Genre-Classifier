She was somewhere else
A thousand miles away
All by herself
Waiting there for me
I'm not awake
I don't want to go
I don't want to be here
Things never change
They don't have to stay the same
It's what she did to be fair
It's what she did to be there
She found a place
With walls that never stay
All to herself
Holding dreams at bay
I'm not afraid
I won't let you go
But I don't believe you
Things never change
But they don't have to stay the same
It's what she did to be fair
It's what she did to be there
Her sister ran away
To start a family
It's out of sequence
How I remember it
I saw the lake of red
And you were there with me
It's not a memory
If we don't remember when
It's just another way
To get back at me
It's not a secret
And no I won't forget
Her sister ran away
To start a family
It's out of sequence
How I remember it
It's just another way
To get back at me
It's not a secret
And no I won't forget
