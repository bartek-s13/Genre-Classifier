I've got a fever, feel a little light in my head
Baby, I've been burning up ever since we met
You might think I'm crazy, you have to forgive me
I've been kind of dizzy since my last relationship

There's no pill for this condition
There's no doctor or prescription
'Cause I get hives
When you ask me if I'll be your girl

I'm allergic to commitment, got some kind of sickness
Every time I'm 'round you, I start feeling really anxious
Nothing that could fix it, wish that I could kick this
You start talking serious, and I start showing
Sy-sy-sy-sy-sy-symptoms, ooh
Sy-sy-sy-sy-sy-symptoms, ooh

Keep your distance, careful not to get too close
I gave it to the one before you, I made him choke
I might disappoint you but I've got a phobia
It's better to warn you than to give you any hope

There's no pill for this condition
There's no doctor or prescription
'Cause I get hives
When you ask me if I'll be your girl

I'm allergic to commitment, got some kind of sickness
Every time I'm 'round you, I start feeling really anxious
Nothing that could fix it, wish that I could kick this
You start talking serious, and I start showing
Sy-sy-sy-sy-sy-symptoms, ooh
Sy-sy-sy-sy-sy-symptoms, ooh

Maybe I'm psycho, give me a white coat
Lock me away, maybe it's better that way
Ain't easy to swallow, my stomach is hollow
Every day that I look at your face
Maybe I'm psycho, give me a white coat
Lock me away, maybe it's better that way
Ain't easy to swallow, my stomach is hollow
Every day that I look at your face

Sy-sy-sy-sy-sy-symptoms, ooh
Sy-sy-sy-sy-sy-symptoms, ooh
Sy-sy-sy-sy-sy-symptoms, ooh

I've got a fever, feel a little light in my head
Baby, I've been burning up ever since we met
