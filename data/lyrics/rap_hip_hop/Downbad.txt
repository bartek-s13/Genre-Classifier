<<<<<<< HEAD
Had to flip it, go retarded
Cooking up, I got the spot hot
Yeah, yeah
I leveled up good enough
If bitches fronting, give 'em up
I don't give a fuck

Cooking up, I got the spot hot
.40 with me, keep it close in the drop-top
Bad bitches, it do not stop
Hundred fifty on the dash when we drive by
Mad niggas know how I rock
Couple bands in the club and it's nonstop
We the ones that get the spot hot
Oh, we the ones that get the spot hot
Cooking up, I got the spot hot
.40 with me, keep it close in the drop-top
Bad bitches, it do not stop
Hundred fifty on the dash when we drive by
Mad niggas know how I rock
Couple bands in the club and it's nonstop
We the ones that get the spot hot
Oh, we the ones that get the spot hot

Let me tell you how it started
I had to flip it, go retarded, tryna make it lead
It's sad how we all departed
They try to treat me like I'm garbage
Now they on my dick
But they know (Oh, they know)
Oh, I know (Oh, I know)
We stay low (We stay low)
Stay on go (Stay on go)
It's cold out and I'm moving hot
Foreigns out when I hit the lot (Skrrt)
One-of-ones when I hit the spot
Man, it's heavy love if I hit the box
If he froze up, I can't let it rock
We the ones known to go make it hot
We won't ever worry I know Won sturdy
If they moving funny, he gonna give a shot
I'm back to my old ways
I'm trapping I'm jugging hard (Trapping I'm jugging hard)
In the hood for the whole day
Flip the pack, I ain't going far (Flip the pack, I ain't going far)
I'm back in my Birk' (I'm back in my Birk')
I'm back in a different bag (I'm back in a different bag)
Oh, this one gon' get em mad
220 a different dash (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)

Cooking up, I got the spot hot
.40 with me, keep it close in the drop-top
Bad bitches, it do not stop
Hundred fifty on the dash when we drive by
Mad niggas know how I rock
Couple bands in the club and it's nonstop
We the ones that get the spot hot
Oh, we the ones that get the spot hot
Cooking up, I got the spot hot

Mad niggas know how I rock
Couple bands in the club and it's nonstop
We the ones that get the spot hot
Oh, we the ones that get the spot hot

I be sittin', thinkin' like I'm in the dark
Swear all of my niggas gotta play a part
Rus Balla be cookin' sauces so shit still be cautious
'Cause he holding these niggas' hearts
K Balla be stunti'n often, up in different Porsches
He don't care about what it cost (No, he don't care)
Only focus about what's important
Gotta get up on him if we hear that he got it all
I'm still on the same shit
Red bottoms push the gas when I lane switch
Man, I know they hate this
Real sad 'cause they know I'ma make it
Swear I had to be patient
Jewels dancing, lookin' like they was ancient
I put that on the same wrist
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I turn my exes to groupie hoes
They gon' show attention when they see the shows
Know my neck looking freezer cold
But it's peter roll if you touch him, so leave him 'lone
I can't fuck her, she average, I like 'em savage
Wack bitches, they was past tense
If he front, let him have it, it get dramatic
Blood dripping on the fashion

Cooking up, I got the spot hot
.40 with me, keep it close in the drop-top
Bad bitches, it do not stop
Hundred fifty on the dash when we drive by
Mad niggas know how I rock
Couple bands in the club and it's nonstop
