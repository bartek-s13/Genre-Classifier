Yeah
Do you still scroll through them texts messages
This henny  got me thinkin' 'bout the things that you said
It was real
For real
Up for three weeks
Feeling half past dead
Sitting here reflecting
On what's in my head
And how I feel
For real

I'm running low so don't play with my time
I'm searching but it's nothing left to find
Send out a call but no one's on the line
So if you want it please make up your mind
Please make up your mind

I don't wanna lose myself loving you (You, you)
Loving you
I don't wanna lose myself loving you (You, you)
Loving you

You know everything 'cause I put it in my songs
If I tell you that I'm working, I ain't out doing you wrong
I got too much on my plate to add some shit that I don't need
I ain't asking you for space just some room to fucking breathe
But I can't stress myself by tryna prove my fucking love
I stand up, say "I had enough"
She stand up "Boy you think you tough"
Take my phone, search what you want
"Who's this bitch?" "Girl that's my mom"
"Who's this woman?" "Girl that's my aunt"
I could be a lame nigga, that's what you want
See you want me to be a pretty liar so bad
But I can't fuck with karma cause she always comes back
So call me every name you can find in the book
But don't try to discredit every chance that I took

I'm running low so don't play with my time
I'm searching but it's nothing left to find
Send out a call but no one's on the line
So if you want it please make up your mind
Please make up your mind

I don't wanna lose myself loving you (You, you, yeah, yeah)
Loving you (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I don't wanna lose myself loving you (You, you)
(I don't wanna lose myself)
Loving you
(I don't wanna lose myself)

I don't wanna lose myself
I don't wanna lose myself
I don't wanna lose myself
I don't wanna lose myself
I don't wanna lose myself
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna lose myself
I don't wanna lose myself
I don't wanna lose myself
I don't wanna lose myself
