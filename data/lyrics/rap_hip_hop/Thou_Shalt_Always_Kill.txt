Thou shalt not take the names of Johnny Cash, Joe Strummer, Johnny Hartman, Desmond Dekker, Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrix or Syd Barrett in vain

Thou shalt not fall in love so easily
Thou shalt not use poetry, art or music to get into girls pants... use it to get into their heads
Thou shalt not watch Hollyoaks
Thou shalt not attend an open mic and leave as soon as you've done your shitty little poem or song, you self-righteous prick!
Thou shalt not return to the same club or bar, week-in, week-out, just 'cause you once saw a girl there that you fancied that you're never gonna fucking talk to anyway

Thou shalt not scream if you wanna go faster
Thou shalt not move to the sound of the wickedness
Thou shalt not make some noise for Detroit
When I say "Hey", thou shalt not say "Ho"
When I say "Hip", thou shalt not say "Hop"
When I say, "He say, she say, we say, 'make some noise,'" kill me
(Ah, I forgot where I was, hang on)

Thou shalt not quote me happy
Thou shalt not shake it like a Polaroid picture
Thou shalt not wish your girlfriend was a freak, like me
Thou shalt spell the word "phoenix" P-H-E-O-N-I-X, not P-H-O-E-N-I-X, regardless of what the Oxford English Dictionary tells you
Thou shalt not express your shock at the fact that Sharon got off with Brad at a club last night by saying, "Izziiit?"

Thou shalt think for yourselves!
And most importantly of all
