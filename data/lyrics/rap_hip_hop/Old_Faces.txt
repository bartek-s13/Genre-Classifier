(Hook)
Osumaru:
She can't recall the name
But she know he palming
No faces
So today she gone get in his way
He pets the cat and then pays it
He dont know the game
But he know they palming no faces
So he gone get all of em paid
Then eat the crumbs from the tables
Pace Otto:
Im fucked up in the head
All i think is cash
Yeah i know how all you niggas do(2x)
Im cold toward these bitches
Cuz they'll burn yo ass
Yeah i know how all you bitches do(2x)
Verse 1: Osumaru
There's never no alarming me
Pump fake then im on to threes
Finna Spark chains like a hunned G's
Leave none for the bank spend all in weeks
Clenched fists no weapon for the pop off
Deep swings to ya chin leave ya top off
Im never cottonelle know you fuck niggas frail
They ain't bout the action, they show and tell
See and swipe, i dont know deht there
Student debt yall dont know deht there
Nod yo head to the beat if you know deht there
I just made money then made lemonade when the
Lemons were brought
I jus made money then spend it in days on the
Shit that i bought
(Hook)
Verse 1: Pace Otto
I dont need assistance, i dont need you niggas
And bitches
Cuz bitches distract from the mission
My back to the hataz, my ears do not listen
But trust that i hear it, these lyrics
Connect to ya spirit a force field's surrounding
My body protect me from bullshit cuz i can't be
Near it
Like FM im serious, i come with persistence
I come with intentions to set me in stone
Give a rose to yo bitch and i set her in stone
Always the tosser, dont fetch me no bone
They request them loans
Then i give em loans, when i need a favor
Pssh Pssh they gone
Thats cool(2x) thats lame
I show no weakness no pain
I peep it all dont change
Oh thats ya loss dont gain
Or hang when im poppin champagne
I dont switch sides or lanes
But cool how i play the game
Its just pussy and money when i make it rain
Yeah my flow on rat-a-tat
Can't keep up i just switch it back
What the fuck is loyal, all deez frauds
You niggas soil, suck dick pause
Period, Menopause, then applause
Did a thick bitch need a thinner broad
Nigga play it smart, neva hit it raw
To young, couldn't watch em crawl
Baby steps but never fallin off(2x)
