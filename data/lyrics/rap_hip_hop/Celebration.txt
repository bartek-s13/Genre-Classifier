<<<<<<< HEAD
I'm Floating like an astral plane (Yea I'm medicated)
Poppin bottles of champagne (its a celebration)
Stay down for a come up Nigga (i was dedicated)
Ambitious, motivated, made a road & then I paved it

I'm juiced up off of 2 cups
It's a good feeling when you know you next up
I was out in the woods I was fed up
A lot of weight on my shoulders had to flex up
I'm a young nigga know I'm gonna mess up
Live and learn from mistakes
Everythang glitters ain't gold
Every flower ain't a rose
And everybody ain't what they say
Mama said you "boy you gonna learn one day
With yo' hard head ass
You every spit of yo dead beat dad
Fucking up a habitat
Blew a bag wish I was smarter when I had it
Could've from the peach state to vacay in Cali
Hustle hard cause don't know about you, but I need to see commas on my balance
Found no love in the streets
Vultures hate to see you eat
Your ga peach might be bite by 3
I thought she was all for me
In yo feelings bout these hoes
They don't want any smoke
It's not that seri though
My friends are turning foes
My life keeps going on
And I don't owe nobody a damn thang
Took a blueprint, 2 cents, made my own lane now in popping champagne

I'm Floating like an astral plane(Yea I'm medicated)
Poppin' bottles of champagne (its a celebration)
Stay down for a come up Nigga (i was dedicated)
Ambitious, motivated, made a road & then I paved it
Now I'm popping champagne

My life like a blunt full OF OG
I WAS BROKE DOWN ROLLED IN a SWISHA SWEET
In hell, abused, hate inhaled
That means my haters wanna smoke me
I could be dead or in jail
Go ahead put me down 6 feet
Fuck the past ain't going back, I ain't going back on repeat
Do this for diggyman & squeak squeak
If you fuck with them you gotta see me
Real life shit this ain't no tv..
If you try me you can catch a 2 piece
This came from the heart not no looseleaf
Cool country n*gga kick it like Bruce Lee
And I only rock them nb's, mossy oaks, or Realtree
I'm out the woods, I'm from the 4, and that's the D if you don't know
I'm out the woods, I'm from the 4, and that's the D if you don't know
Out the woods, I'm from the 4, I'm out the woods, I'm from the 4
On an astral plane & it feels like another planet
If you not from the struggle then you wouldn't understand it
I remember back (Back way) remember I had some bad days
No hope had a sad face, on the road to riches its a drag race

I'm Floating like an astral plane (Yea I'm medicated)
Poppin' bottles of champagne (its a celebration)
Stay down for a come up Nigga (i was dedicated)
