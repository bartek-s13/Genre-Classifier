<<<<<<< HEAD
(Intro-Trapperman Dale)
Oh shit I might go and cop them forges
My mama say life by decisions
Well let me decide, and stand ?
Pull up the crack head whore is there, picked up some glass
Go tell em the o is here
I learned this shit from the mud, only thing moving out this bitch drug dealin
Aye, live life independent, fuck signing deals, live life like its litty
I still hold white when its ?, an ounce sold pipe right nigga milly
Let me get right for a min, Hell I caught hell of a bite off of Hillers
I  just passed ?, and he broke his neck trying see through the bubble line lenses
Aye more yay, cash in, saving up everything past 10
I play the middle if you can make sure I'm leaving with 20 whenever its in
I lost some trust but gaining with ends
Aye you know, sat down with who knows
I told my niggas If I go, then you go
Won't see me out, unless I'm getting pesos
(Chorus-Trapperman Dale)
Aye, follow me cause you know we gon eat right
Stash getting low, bag getting low, now you know its on 3 right
Niggas say he want what, nigga say he want beef, well you know we gonna beef right
I'm pushing blow in the winter, I'm serving drop out the drop its a rental
See most them be pretenders, daddy hung me off a cliff call me simba
(Verse 1-Trapperman Dale)
I got the game from a real one, I scrap the sides of the pot I'm chemist
Baby got back with the latest, but baby got ass in the back its a fetish
Homie went straight to the pens, violated the 10 now I run the reception
Aye 10-4, big bet, lose it all get it back, lets win
Who say my name in the trap, I go ham, I got boy in the air call me heartbreak again
Get on your ass, and fuck who you with
Aye you know, I come from Pluto
I'm rocking balls out the park at 2 tho
Shake down the bag, and go serve it to ?
Aye more racks, both ends
Simmer down shake back, bo flex
Aye I can't tell you what happened to me when I went to the D
Now I'm floodin this bitch, went copped a watch that's a flood on my wrist
But you know, I'm staying too low
Get this profit, and stack up them euros
I dont trust a bank, I got cash under too floors
(Chorus-Trapperman Dale)
Aye, follow me cause you know we gon eat right
Stash getting low, bag getting low, now you know its on 3 right
Niggas say he want what, nigga say he want beef, well you know we gonna beef right
(Verse 2-Trapperman Dale)
Aye I was born in September, crazy how I get em gone in September
I got the game from a real one, baby got back with that sack she a real one
I just fuck with real ones, you fuck with me and them niggas gonna kill somethin
He talk a lot, he gonna tell something
Give me a bail, and watch me make bail hundred
Go get the cash, like pay up
I don't negotiate prices, now pay up
I want it all like straight up
Broke down a 9 in the trap, now pay up
See them little niggas be hatin
But I was taught stay out the way, get ya cake up
I don't trust shit I'm playa, I swear I got bags serving shit in Decatur
I play shit how it go, ive been here before the spot getting ate up
10 stacks, lets get, trip time Az I'm with it
I'm cookin yola, just ran out of soda
Just brought back some over sold, tell homie to get it
Save by a bell, lets say I'm committed
Aye you know, still off in Pluto
Just sold a half in the trench at the back door
I'm in the field, catching plays in the condo
(Chorus-Trapperman Dale)
Aye, follow me cause you know we gon eat right
Stash getting low, bag getting low, now you know its on 3 right
Niggas say he want what, nigga say he want beef, well you know we gonna beef right
