I.M.B

Money on our mind
All mighty dollar bill
Young so we gotta kill
Hoop dreaming or gotta deal
Proud
So we do even worried how you probably feel
Ain't got a meal
Cuz poppa killed
Or doing life
Cuz poppa real
No time to squeal 
Momma kneel
Spit and she swooping still
Got her ill
Got a feel
So she go and pop a pill
Gotta cop a pill
To kill the pain
Gotta kill the pain
That's inside her brain
Feel so good
When she call your name
Flesh burning
But without the flame
And we just met
So the Froot is strange
Souls left for dead
Another body hangs
Why are you sleeping in my bed?
Messing with my head! (Repeat 2x)

I sit and wonder
In loving color
Death weighing on my brain
I ain't getting younger
No food in my fridge
Can you feel my hunger?
Don't wanna chill outside
Might get hit this summer
All I see is skirts
All I hear is drummers
All I smell is trees
We was chopping lumber
My man did a bid
We can taste his number
The devil play for keeps
He tryna take us under
Hate when you doing good
Remember when they burnt the hummer?
Lord set us free
Or else I need a come up
I swear I'll put this blunt up
I hardly pick this cup up
But it just make me numb up
And it kills the pain
Kills the pain
That's inside my brain
Feels so good
When she call my name
And we just met
So the Froot is strange
Souls left for dead
We was tryna hang
Why are you sleeping in my bed?
Messing with my head! (Repeat 2x)
