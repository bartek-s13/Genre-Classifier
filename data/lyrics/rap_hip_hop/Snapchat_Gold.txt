She was golden

She was Snapchat gold
That bitch was Snapchat gold
Woah now she was Snapchat gold
That bitch was Snapchat gold

Baby she maneuver make it snap and roll
Like the way she movin' baby take control
Baby had that ass it was Snapchat gold
Rollie on my wrist it was Snapchat gold
Man I'm with the shits I rep my dog
Gold plated whips in the gold face garage
Rolling with my gold, 50 for the pack of papers
Swollen my pockets yeah you know I got this paper
Phone in my pocket she was gold had to tape her
Drop it like a comet yeah that ass could leave a crater
Don’t wanna be my photo thot, then get up out my ‘Rari
She wanna be the golden thot I put up on my story
She wanna see my 100 foot yacht I take her to the bay zone
Baby looking hella hot might take her to the bae zone
Catch that ass on camera photograph her no filter
Photographer that camera work go gold like the glitter

She was Snapchat gold
That bitch was Snapchat gold
Woah now she was Snapchat gold
That bitch was Snapchat gold
Woah now she was Snapchat gold
That bitch was Snapchat gold
Woah now she was Snapchat gold
That bitch was Snapchat gold

Shawty she was golden
Go on and I post it
Got baes globally but my geotag New Orleans
My geotag in Philly had to take her home to moms
Found her at the Palms, not in Vegas out on Broad
She can be my broad if that booty lookin’ broad
Baby make it pop, baby had a bubble butt
Breaking necks they passing by like baby oh my god
Like the way she twerk it think that she need an award
Think that she need a medal, because that body is golden
And my pockets so swollen I think that I might award it
Always love competition, too many fish in the sea
Baby hittin’ my line and I’m replying "we’ll see"
I might reply if she perfect or just ignore her for fun
Or I might lie my location, lay low lowkey like I’m gone
Sometimes I make it official, or snap her off with no picture
I saw a girl on my story who made me wish I was single
Woah now

She was Snapchat gold
That bitch was Snapchat gold
Woah now she was Snapchat gold
That bitch was Snapchat gold
Woah now she was Snapchat gold
That bitch was Snapchat gold
Woah now she was Snapchat gold
That bitch was Snapchat gold
(Woah now)
