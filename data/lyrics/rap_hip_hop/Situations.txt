Ah, this nigga got me in my feelings!
I fucked up, hon, I know!
I'm learning, I'm gon be-
See I, thought the world of you
But so you know
Girl I, cause I loved you
You were my girl
See I
Girl I, cause I loved you
You were my girl

Look, only stress been dealt
You should be there to help with what I've been dealin' with
We draw so many conclusions
And now we wonderin' why we can't make the picture fit
We both wrong, can't see an end it
Know we should leave but won't
'Cause we done been in there too long to let someone come and reap all the benefits
You got me fucked up, I argue 7 days before you treat me like some weak nigga
I know of some niggas tryna sleep wit' ya
The thought of it hard to stomach like cheap dinners
But I'd be damned if I called you up and agreed wit' ya
Knowin' I ain't wrong but all of this fightin' and stressin' going on
I rather just have you undressin' in my home
I really miss you and I know that it's wrong
But I just can't pick up the phone
Fuck that
You don't have to call, baby, no
'Cause I'ma be all right tonight
You don't have to call, baby, no, no
'Cause I'ma be all right tonight (Yeah, yeah)
Situations

Yeah, situation shit, shit
Every situation is own battle, create its own ladder
We gotta climb
Every time I do something good for you, I'm in my own shadow
It's never enough, I could never adjust to us knowin' we so fragile
Them rumors can turn up and have our home shattered
All the times you heard something, you could have your own cattle
Man, I swear you just don't get it
Why you think your friends keep comin' up?
With different suspicions on how our love was up (I loved you)
All that clubbin' and twerkin' they do is a cover-up
These bitches want everything that you fuckin' up
And you gon' let these hoes win
She responded, "Baby, you right"
Set her bags down, now she stayin' the night
She lay her head down and I'm sayin' goodnight
I get a text from my side bitch like, "Is she sleep yet?"
It's that creep-text (You don't have to go baby, no)
That she want nothing from me but deep sex (I'ma be all right tonight)
When we argue all I want is that deep neck without the fussin'
My side chick let me fuck her without the cussin'
Tell myself it ain't really cheatin', we just fuckin'
(You don't have to go baby, no)
We know where it is (I'ma be all right tonight)
In the end, we ain't wrong
You don't deserve it and I know what I'm doing
But I just can't leave her alone (Situations)
Goddamn
You don't have to call, baby, no
'Cause I'ma be all right tonight
You don't have to call, baby, no, no
'Cause I'ma be all right tonight
