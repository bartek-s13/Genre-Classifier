I don't know how to feel anymore, no
Heartbroken, I been drowning in my sorrows
Do it to myself (Do it to myself)
Yeah I do it to myself (Do it to myself)
I don't know how to feel anymore, no
Heartbroken, I been drowning in my sorrows
Do it to myself, I don't care about tomorrow
Sometimes I do drugs to ease the pain, now I'm hollow

Why am I always anxious?
I need help, I can't take it
Tryna put a smile on my face, can't fake it
I would say "I'm numb", but these scars weren't painless
I could look you in your face and tell that you changed
I been on my own, and on my own, I think I'll stay
When you say you love me, it's a slap right in my face
'Cause your actions speak louder than the bullshit you claim
I don't know if I hate my life or love my life
Everything's alright, I'm still hurting
I been all alone, tryna do this on my own
Takin' drugs to ease the pain, but that shit stopped working
I know that this ain't worth it
I'm so insecure and nervous
I can't even tend to find my purpose
Better off dead 'cause I'm not a good person

I don't know how to feel anymore, no
Heartbroken, I been drowning in my sorrows
Do it to myself, I don't care about tomorrow
Sometimes I do drugs to ease the pain, now I'm hollow
I don't know how to feel anymore, no
Heartbroken, I been drowning in my sorrows
Do it to myself, I don't care about tomorrow
Sometimes I do drugs to ease the pain, now I'm hollow

I know, you know
I said "I know, you know"
I say "I know, you know"
I say "I know, you know"
