I'm in love again, I’m in love again
Of this, make what you will
I'm just looking for that thrill, tonight
To love again, to love again
All the time I have, I borrow
I'm not living for tomorrow, it’s not there

Alive again, alive again
I don't need to die tonight
To die tonight
And so very long, it's true
All the games I played to reach you
I don't care at all, I don't care at all
Throw it all away, away
There'll be time to laugh
Time to laugh, some day

To fade away, to fade away
The ties we have we'll sever
You know nothing lasts forever, anyway

Way-ay-ay-ay
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
