VERSE 1
Kicked off my shoes
And ran a mile through my mind
A Couple laps around the track of thought I lose all the time
My sight is doing fine
Cause All isee is dollar signs
And famous people
So I know pretty soon the whole world will be
Mine
I'm caught in demonstrations
Where women be contemplating dating me
And the relization that somebody is always hating
That really gets me thinking
So out this bottle I'll start drinking
Til I can't feel nothing else
But the drums of this song beating
My heart beat
Beating just a lil irregular
Because my other half is missing
I need to be next to her
So I'm tryna fill it
Feeling up all these women
Trying not to catch feelings
Think of her while I am drilling
That's the crazy thing about this world that we live in
You can have it all
And still want something different
I'm learning everyday
Focus more on giving
This for everybody that don't get
HOOK
Winter spring summer time
IM A REAL PERSON
Rainfall thunder shine
IM A REAL PERSON
My name dawg you can find under
Real Person

VERSE 2
Feel like I took the pill from limitless
Cuz I been on some different shit
Difference is between me and you
I'm sick
You just in bed
Coulda made loot the Caine
Root
But chose school instead
Went ahead
And got them student loans
Now I gotta choose again
Always remember you could lose ya life in this shit
Its all one big
Game
And Ima strike in this bitch
I mean if going down at all then I'm going down fighting
Got this alcohol in me
So you know I'm not frightened
I'm just coping
Tryna lighten
All the pressure on me
I mean somedays
I feel like Akon cause I'm mr lonely
RIP to Darien
I can't forget you homie
Got so caught up with all this music
I ain't check in on you
I often front bout how I'm feeling
When I'm with my homies
Cuz you was there before the songs
Back when my hair was long and
I know you think you prolly never left impression
On me
But
Little bro was in awe that u was so 6'4
And every time I'd pass the ball to it was assist oh fasho

We used to run the halls in the 6th grade
Now sometimes you make me ball in a different way
I feel ashamed I never called
But sent you them links
Now I realized this shit is not at all what you would think

Now I miss
Them summers
In them aau leagues
Flying eagles gold
Was the name of the team
That we played on
Damn how n the fuck could they spray on
A lanky ass lightskin dude thin as a crayon
Smile like ya moms
She lit up when you play on
You taught me how to fight tall niggas
Back at fame yard
Member back when we was kids
Now a days these niggas ain't hard
You never get to choose the hand you dealt
That's why I hate cards
I wish that I could call you dawg I hate this....
