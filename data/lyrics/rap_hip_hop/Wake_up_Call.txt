This one is dedicated to the educated
And all the special people who cannot be replicated
Real rap isn't being demonstrated
But I'm the bomb so it's 'bout time that I detonated
I'm estimatin' that whack rappers are hesitatin'
To come back at me cause I'll start devastatin'
And depricatin'
Separatin' one by one and have you speculating
I had to come out hard, no time for under-estimating
I'm penetrating your mind
I'ma start relegating
New definition of lightskin no disrespect to drake
After my rhymes you're enlightened, didn't finish your plate
Think about it, you weigh less
Hot air leaves your brain weightless
That's why my flow cold and hard
So I'll start cashing paychecks
Do I got to break it down like a dope line?
Don't censor that cause I'm talking 'bout dope rhymes
That direct me towards greatness like most signs
Pursuit of Happiness, I'm just chasing my dreams
It takes some classiness to be a part of my team
Pretty boy, don't like ashy-ness I can get you some cream
Broke before but now my pockets the grassy-est cause I'm all    about (Cream)
(Whoo) Remember When I used to drink tang?
And them talent shows when little homie used to Sing?
And back in them days when break dancing was my thing?
Damn
But nowadays I'm perfecting my craft
Got a verse ready for anyone
I dare you to laugh
I ain't a king yet
But y'all  can prepare for my wrath
(The game don't know me so its dying slowly)
That's why I call myself the savior of rap
Just save all your crap
Throw them notebooks away and put your pen back in the cap
I ain't really want to have to change the game
But every time I switch the radio it sounds the same
It's not an art anymore
The lyricism is lame
So right about now you should get used to my name
I understand if y'all just trynna get the party jumpin'
But if you make a mil off it don't think that you're somethin'
They don't like your words son
They liking the beat
Merked on the track
How you liking defeat?
I'm bright as can be
I strike like a bee
Except, I don't down boy
Vikatin's weak
I'm lightin' this beat
Fire in the booth and can't nobody put it out
When they say my name I know that you be looking out
Couple people never heard of me
They said I ain't making it
We know how the saying goes
But trust that I ain't' faking it
The beast is still asleep, don't worry, yet
I ain't waking it
I could set the bar real high
Instead, I'm just taking it
A flagrant
Every time I see a mic, it's dangerous
My flow is something new, and it's pretty flavorous
If you pick a pen up after this it's pretty traitorous
And don't think you know my next move, I'm spontaneous
I'm not arrogant, I just speak the truth
No 34
Come near me with a dis, I'll sweep you up like a dirty floor
If you ain't notice yet, your girlfriend is a dirty (whoa)
Back-track
Starting with that "whack rap"
Jnice get yo shit together, put it in that backpack
Don't ever look back at, any of them flashbacks
Just focus on your abstract
Test 'em like a lab rat
Then make everybody's brain flip out, like a flapjack
They looking at my poker face, but they playing blackjack
My chances are higher now like I work with the Black Cat
