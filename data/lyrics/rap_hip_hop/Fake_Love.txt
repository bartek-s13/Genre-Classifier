They tried, yeah, you know they tried to break us
All them late nights I make you wait up
I pull up, you in nothin' but your makeup
I fuck you 'til the mornin', ain't no fake love
I put them diamonds all on you like a glacier, ooh
Have 'em wildin', them bitches, they be hatin'
We be fightin' and I just wanna make up
Are you riding? 'Cause I don't do no fake love

I'm from the curb so they know what I be made of
I'm from the curb so so they know I ain't no stranger, ayy
But that money have your people hella change up
It's more lonely as I'm gettin' more famous
You said you was ridin', told you I'd be faithful
I gave you all my time, you've been actin' ungrateful
So much on my mind, bitch, you know I got my plate full
You was here to take away the stress, that's why I rate you, ayy

We be fightin' and I just wanna make up
Are you riding? 'Cause I don't do no fake love
I ain't lyin', only wear my glasses when I can't swear
Fell in love with my driver, heart still in fifth gear
Say you're your brother's keeper, but you're tryna rocket these things
Bought your ice all in the winter, don't you turn your heart blings
Dodgin' felonies, swervin' eulogies
Took your heart all in a beat, made you part of me
Fuckin' in the sun, fuck the shade, we in jacuzzis
I can't have you single 'cause you never been a groupie
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, fake love like Drizzy's tune
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, no makeup, beautiful
Gotta make you mine, I told your daddy I'ma marry you
And I know I ain't perfect but vice versa, girl, I'll bet you won't
When you get home, you should come and get in the bath
You know I'm your dog
And if I get you on fours
Take a picture that we never can post, yeah

They tried, yeah, you know they tried to break us
