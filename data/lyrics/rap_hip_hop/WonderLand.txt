(Chorus: Brandon Blackbeard)
Trip to the wonderland, Magic like its Peter Pan, Wild'n out like Im the man. On the moon, you can reach me if you can but you probly' gon' need an extra,terrestrial. I rate you won't, no where you are-In touch with us. Take a trip to the wonderland
(Verse: Brandon Blackbeard)
Most times Im on the weed to hear the demon speak. Tell me that you blow too. I be on the come up I require to releasing all my energy on beats, Im supplied by the internet on regular- Im customer. Bringing up the drummer, Im', rarely ever hearing symphonies- I- Use em' when Im the hook and equally they come up good as any verse that I approach, Poachers I be watching. P.H, Concessions, an elephant's an elephant regardless if you made it or you found it there. P.S, disrespect producer-think you better than. Aladdin better grab the ladder then, write letter to, Peter Pan. I man on the moon any song, veteran. Blackbeard I bet he'd, brung' the heat- Kalahari man. When, visiting the space shuttle coming in. Trip to the motherland, wonderland- The working of a superman
