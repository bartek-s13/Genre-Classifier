Cold... as... ice... (You know that you are)
Cold... as... ice... (You're cold as ice to me)
Cold... as... ice... (Ohh shit!!)

You're as cold as ice
You're willing to sacrifice
You're as cold as ice
You're willing to sacrifice
You're as cold as ice
You're willing to sacrifice
You're as cold as ice
You're willing to sacrifice

I'd like to welcome mothafuckas to the back
Of the mind of Bill, see I'm for real
When delivering these M.O.P. tactics
I'll bury you bastards, I custom make caskets
The B.G. (Doja nigga) The Y.G. (Soldier nigga)
Even the O.G. (Cobra nigga) Told ya nigga
I may come, with my gun in my hand
To make sure you mothafuckas understand

Pardon me! How the fuck you gon' start with me?
I'm a heavyweight in this game, you just spar with me
You get laced down, from your face down, drop your shit
Niggas thought M.O.P. stand for "mop" and shit
Don't... don't... don't... get it twisted
I told you that we top of the line designed realistic for instance
Mash Out Posse will come through and clear your ass out
Dump and air your ass out, chump, we cold
You're as cold as ice
You're willing to sacrifice
You're as cold as ice
You're willing to sacrifice
You're as cold as ice
You're willing to sacrifice
You're as cold as ice
You're willing to sacrifice

A predicate gun buster, I passed all classes
One of the fastest at blasting flashes (Berk)
You seen my work, you know my steez
It's a slim chance that I'mma hesitate to squeeze, please
Money never made me, money never played me (No!!)
And Money bet' not make me wack his ass
Subtract his ass when I step through his hood
Fuck dropping you, I'm into stopping you for good

Stop him if you could (You're as cold as ice)
And you'll be, stiff as a log in a suit looking nice
You's a sinner nigga (You're as cold as ice)
But you ain't cold enough to freeze hot slugs when they run up in ya
You ain't in my class nigga, I'm the last nigga
You gon' fuck around and get blast, sucka-ass nigga
The soul survivor, survivor sole
Nigga you roll and I roll, let's stroll, I told you that I'm cold
You're as cold as ice
You're willing to sacrifice
You're as cold as ice
You're willing to sacrifice
You're as cold as ice
You're willing to sacrifice
You're as cold as ice
You're willing to sacrifice

Yo, I terrorize guys (Exercise!)
Street formula, our hip hop shows, cause pandemonium
Shit, I ain't concerned 'til it's my turn, I snatch a mic
Jump on the stage and show my ass like Howard Stern
But not in that form (Hell nah!)
I perform, lyrical heatwaves, that'll keep your brain warm
But when it's on, you fuck around and get ripped up
Or get placed in a bodybag, with that ass zipped up
Toe tag 'em! (Got 'em!)

Even ballistics won't be able to tell
How the fo'-fo' ragged 'em
Dragged 'em, halfway down the block, now you know
Where a nigga go when a nigga close up a nigga shop
(You're as cold as ice) Fuck you!
Tell me something new, on behalf of the First Family staff
And homicide crews in control
Real niggas won't fold, I told you we were cold
You're as cold as ice
You're willing to sacrifice
You're as cold as ice
You're willing to sacrifice
You're as cold as ice
You're willing to sacrifice
You're as cold as ice
You're willing to sacrifice
You're as cold
You're willing
You're as cold
To sacrifice
You're as cold
To sacrifice
You're as cold as ice
You're willing to sacrifice
