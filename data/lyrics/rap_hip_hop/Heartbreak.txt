So much life, why so fragile?
So little time, please, can you make it home?
I don't wanna see you go
I need more time by your presence
Light the sky, love your shine, I know
Please just make it home

Please just make it home (Mhm)

Heartbreak, heartbreak
You left me here, fucked-up 'til death
I hate heartbreak, heartbreak
