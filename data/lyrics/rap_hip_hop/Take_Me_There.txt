TAKE ME THERE

Vonnie this is your father
Where the hell you at?
Your mother is worrying
The police just killed a boy outside
So you need to get your a** in the house

Don't take me there
Don't take me there
Don't take me there
Please don't take there!
You don't wanna take me there
Don't take me there
I can't lose
Don't make me swear
I got the good news
Just tryna make it clear
My skin ain't fair
Do I make you scared?
But ya'll fools
Gone make me take it there
Don't take me there
Don't take me there
Don't take me there
Please don't take there!
You don't wanna take me there
Don't take me there

In the shadow of death you better choose life
Tryna walk up in this new life
Been brought up with my crew like
WE FROM THE BRONX THAT ZOO LIFE!

Use to twist our fingers like yoga
I swear these streets is like poker
Pep talks about the cola
Going cold turkey got colder
Withdrawals got us sicker than Ebola
Used to cop that s*** up off the corner
Stressed out on the sofa
Make a young make to smoker
Smoke til his lungs hurt
Thats pneumonia
Taking straight shots of the cognac
Got my piss stronger than ammonia
Scared to take a leak up on corner
Cuz the police will pull you over
And kill you just to reach a quota
Said you had Reached for a holster
But it's skittles and a Arizona
D***
I can't lose
Don't make me swear
I got the good news
Just tryna make it clear
My skin ain't fair
Do I make you scared?
But ya'll fools
Gone make me take it there
Don't take me there
Don't take me there
Don't take me there
Please don't take there!
You don't wanna take me there
Don't take me there

Breaking more than bread
Cup full of red
If you miss the target
Then we gonna end up dead
Cop yelling me to spread!
While patting down my legs
Jesus take my soul if he put one in my head
Bang!

I can't lose
Don't make me swear
I got the good news
Just tryna make it clear
My skin ain't fair
Do I make you scared?
But ya'll fools
Gone make me take it there
Don't take me there
Don't take me there
Don't take me there
Please don't take there!
You don't wanna take me there
Don't take me there

Don't forget to pick up some newports
Or we gone have a problems
