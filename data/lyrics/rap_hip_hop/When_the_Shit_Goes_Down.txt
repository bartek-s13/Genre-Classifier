<<<<<<< HEAD
Livin on fat pockets on flat with the gat
Rolling around nine deuce cadillac
Still got my homies to watch my back
And they'll smoke your ass if you wanna come and chat
That's why some pigs and the kids come sweating they follow
A hollow point shell's hard to swallow (heyy)
Why wallow when you come to roll on I put the clip in the four five
Bring your ass on, left kicking dust as you hear the gat bust
My cribs surrounded, I'm about to get rushed, I brushed with death
How many shells stuffed in my closet where my big chrome things kept

When the shit goes down you better be ready (when the shit goes down)
When the shit goes down you better be ready (when the shit goes down)
When the shit goes down you better be ready (when the shit goes down)
When the shit goes down you better be ready (you better be ready)

I told the boys get the sawed off Glock and the rest of the gats
As I strapped on the bullet-proof vest
BOOM, I think I got one to the chest
Hot damn I didn't want to kill a man shit
I still stand tall with the hill clan ya'll better stand back
Niggas bout ta fall, I'm coming out blasting like Yosemite Sam
Got the cheese an the bread for the ham

When the shit goes down you better be ready (when the shit goes down)
When the shit goes down you better be ready (when the shit goes down)
When the shit goes down you better be ready (when the shit goes down)
