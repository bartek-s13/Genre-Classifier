If you don't want my love then the road goes on without you
Leave me just enough and I'll make a little song about you
I could be standing in the rain but my heart won't break in two
Not over you
If you don't my love then there's nothing I can do
If you don't my love I'll be packing up my suitcase
And no matter what you say I'm gonna find myself a new place
I could be gone without as trace
But still my love is a true I'm a fool for you
If you don't my love then there's nothing I can do
If you don't want my love if you don't want my love
If you don't my love then there's nothing I can do
You know my heart would be slowly breaking
That old feeling comes and goes
I'd rather die than to live without you
But things can change you know
If you don't want my love then the road goes on without you
Leave me just enough and I'll make a little song about you
I could be standing in the rain but my heart won't break in two
Not over you
If you don't my love then there's nothing I can do
If you don't want my love if you don't want my love
If you don't my love then there's nothing I can do
I use to love you love a million bucks
I guess I'll always be a fool in love
If you don't want my love well bye bye
