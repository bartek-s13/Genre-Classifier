Flipped a couple pack on my own now
Spend a little cash on my own now
Went and paved a different path on my own now
Swear to God I'm never going back to my hometown
Damn
Made a couple racks on my own now
Hittin' bitches from the back of my home now
Kid stay strapped on my own now
Swear to God I'm never going back to my hometown
Damn
I think I'm the man
Just spent fifty grand
Don't think y'all understand
Damn
Damn
I live for the bands
Just try to keep me from thriving
Don't think that you can
Damn

Cause Lord knows
It's 'bout time the world knows
Made myself the plug like Digiorno
Just pray that your girl don't know (oh no)
Came a long way from trappin' packs out the backseat
Of a taxi
Screaming "fuck the government" and free Max B
Whole crew living tax-free
But we just getting started if you ask me
Lord knows
It's 'bout time your girl knows
But there ain't no way that your girl don't know
Oh no
