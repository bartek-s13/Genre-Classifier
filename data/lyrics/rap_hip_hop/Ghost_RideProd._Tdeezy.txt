<<<<<<< HEAD
(Intro:)
You know...im tired of these bitch niggas thinkin
They can rap. This that new shit
YOU CANT RAP! Can't fuckin rap...
(Verse 1)
Ghost ride the bike, park, hop out, then water whip
Ya daughter wanna get slaughtered, consistent with
Breaking hips
Never miss a stroke I got faith in my grip
And petty niggas fake ion give them boys shit
Two bad bitches on my broomstick
Can't decide which, see you miss what i get
Said i can't decide which
Yeen butter with the flow, just step aside bitch
Death when she on top thats a ride and die bitch
Great I want a bad bitch to die along with
She never miss a call when she dial on dick
Blowing on skunk like a mexican's armpits
We black niggas got chains but we dont own shit
A game made for the white man he control this
But we succumb with intellect my flow shows this
Lemme catch another flow for you niggas
Catch it(3x)
(Verse 2)
You whack niggas not hot
U can't dress you not fly
Its all truth on these tracks i got proof i dont lie
No reason why would I? Put that on moms
And Fetty Waps good eye
Who gay? Who not? Not Sam not I
You jarheads like Hoo-Rah, Hooray
Get green like Allen. Who Ray?
I say fuck what you say
Gave no fucks on Tuesday, I been high for two days
Tryna get too paid
I just got the flu mane, Just copped the Flu Games
If a blood sued Wu-Tang
Id say how you sue Wu mane?
Shane heard the flow like boy you a fool mane
Im hungry gotta eat, still ain't full mane
We went to school near Fulton and Main
Seems like yesterday was our first day
Our graduation is just a month away
Pray with my nigga like," Father please dont
Let us throw our lives away
Pray our hard work does not go to waste."
Cuz we gotta move our moms out of that place
Its sprints on my mind, a steady pace on my brain
It be stuck in my brain
