Big up Dirty Dike on the beat
Shoutouts to RF, Black Ink
Shoutout to Macdot, Brighton Town
This is how we do this
Yeah, let's go in
Yo, yo

See me I'm walking, why cause I don't run fam
Make a film about me find a proper fucking stuntman
I'm Captain Wiz and I'm actually shoving dirt in a dustpan
And blowin' it back in faces of wastemen who try and brush man
I get a wheel in the club on the microphone
They didn't know I handle bars, it's a minor though
They offered me some gear but I'm over tired
All this talkin' make a bredda wanna cycle home, yo
I flabbergast that bredda my stamina can be coming in handy
Flippin' the script, I'm doing a what?
I'm telling a story, doing a Plan B
How the fuck on earth did we become so angry?
Couple years ago, man was just reading the dandy
So how'd I go from reading the beano to beatin' up emos
Swimmin' in speedos to swingin' in chinos
Mimicking heroes to zeros
From Zoro to Tarantinos, we're living like weirdos
I guess the level of violence increases as the fear grows, but
Just 'ca I spit on beats, I'ma spit acapella
Don't think I won't rap a fella
Smack that nigga make an aki swell up, leave him black and yellow
I ain't talking Wiz Khalifa, this wiz kidda the beater, you a rancid dweller
Got the dank piff in my cellar, I'm the dank piff seller
Ting is smelling way too much so wrap that in some cella
Celebrate ca' man wan' tell a mate about this massive fella
On the beat, and on the tune there ain't no aki better fassies fed up
Yo, in my raps, there's unlimited lyrics and syllables
Hittin' my pinnacle isn't a miracle it's kinda literal
Feeling a feeling that's minimal
Physical feeling it's more of a spiritual
Hearing a visual audible justification of lyrically winning
That's why I be spittin' again, and again and again
Grippin' the tip of the pen, hitting a spliff of the lem
They lyrically stepping to me?
Nah, I be lyrically stepping to them
Yeah they levelling up but I'm levelling better than them
Tell it to lesser men wizzy be stressing 'em
Never addressing 'em, never ever again, never ever again
Watch me, clock me, knock me but don't stop me
I got flocks that watched and got knocked knee properly
I got props from lots of chops it's often got me
Gassed as a motherfucker lost and cocky, what G?
You can't tell me that I don't win
Ca on the beat I'm like a granddad I go in
Unique bredda yeah I got my own ting
You neek, you're not unique with gold rings
I'm a young brother with a lot of heart
Been at it from the start, I can tell you're gonna chart
But how you gonna hold a man when older man ain't half as smart Trying to control a man like Zola can in Upton Park
I'm holding more knowledge than a folder can
I'm focused and you know I love my art
Ain't no more holding grams For Ocean man
Notice that I know my plan
Teedot told me Ropa Dope's a joke you need to go for man
So Ocean goes for man, I owe you fam
Owe you dat, came in the game with a whole new act
Invading the brain with a whole new rap
Blatantly stating that your whole crew's wack
I had to do that, had to man up
If you ain't got the balls to copy then bad luck
You ain't got the balls to copy you fat fuck
You ain't got the balls to copy I'm that much, I got
Exquisite ability mimicking vividest imagery lyrically stinging a killer bee
Killing the similes willyly nillily, wanna be chillin with Fiddy and Diddy
And Cudi the Kidy listening to Biggie
Buming a ciggy with Dizzy and Weezy
Sucking a titty like giggiddy giggiddy, my ability can't mimic me
Flow, buggsy, bigadibobadi
Gota be properly on it to stop a G
Copping the hottest of property, not a monopoly
Actual life, ain't no toppin' me, stoppin' and floppin' is comedy
Honestly quality optical oddities, not in an odyssey
Tell a man straight you've been warned, no wallaby
Ain't feelin' the court, don’t follow G
People we need to abort this policy horribly
Course discographies making me feel like I'm war-ing constantly
(Applaud and follow me)
(I said applaud and follow me)
(I said applaud and follow me)
But I ain't even trying to be that type of guy
Ain't trying to be that type of breh
Ain't tryng to lead that type of life you know
Like I ain't even trying to meet myself a wife
Ain't trying to meet myself no dame
I'm trying to keep myself alright, you know
I feel the sudden rush of heat when I'm on stage
I don't compete with none you pagans
Ca it's peak to fuck with wastemen
My flow is sweet I know the streets they love to taste it
But I'm feelin undertakerish, putting niggas in graves and shit
So ask True Fizz, us man are runnin' shit
But the truth is, these other man are runnin' quick
But if the shoe fits, wear it, and it fits me
See I'm runnin' oh so quickly, so stick me
At the top of the roster where Big be
Big beats got me feeling like twigs in a sandwich I stick to the wrap
No giving it back
I'm flipping a packet of cigs, ripping the cig down the mids
Sprinkling cig on my riz, sprinkling piff on the cig on the riz
Sprinkling cig on the piff on the cig on the riz
