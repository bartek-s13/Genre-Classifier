Otay
Chorus
Otay Otay
Ji-Cue boiii that be yo day
8/3 got me like oh yay
Celebration all on all me
Work all day
Work all night
But it’s my day
Imma do what I like
Fine ass ladies
And my gang on sight
(pause)
Imma crazy baby
But Imma be alright
Verse 1
Imma be just fine
On my New York grind
I ain’t duccin
I ain’t runnin
I ain’t wasting no time
Tell Rocc keep comin
These beats straight fire
N I keep on thuggin
Till the beat get tired
N since that’ll never happen
I guess im always staccin
With a bitch that’s worth the braggin
Like the bitch that met Aladdin
Now come fly away
Smoking this moon rocc
I’m feeling a way
Got me a chicc
She makes trips through the state
Toast to the good life
But how does it taste
What a mistake
You can get out of my face
All on my own
& the Benjamin’s raised
Look at how far
The pendulum sways
I’m outta my cage
Leo still stuck in his ways
Duhhh
Cuz I gotta get paid
Chorus
Otay Otay
Ji-Cue boiii that be yo day
8/3 got me like oh yay
Celebration all on all me
Work all day
Work all night
But it’s my day
Imma do what I like
Fine ass ladies
And my gang on sight
(pause)
Imma crazy baby
But Imma be alright
