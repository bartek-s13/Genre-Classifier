What's done in the dark comes to light
For sho
So the thing you did with her
I was gonna know
You impressing these girls
Showin' off your flow
But I got my own bank
So I'm out the door (oh oh)
You callin' me saying, "baby, please."
Don't believe those lies
Crawlin' on your knees
You're the only liar in the midst of me
You're a dirt bag
So just get away from me (ee ee)

What you do will always come back to you
I'm tired of playin' games with you
I'm really not feelin' you and
What you say
Don't mean a damn thing to me
Tried to make a fool out of me
It's all just history
You make me wanna shout
Make me wanna scream
Make me loose my cool
But I'm gonna throw my hands up

Day after day
You're telling me your story
Saying your girlfriend
Just lying on me
You say they just want
What you got
Wanting your post
Boy, I think not
Man, you think you're so hot
You're the victim
Or so you say
I guess they're throwing
Their drawers and bras your way
I guess those condoms weren't yours
Belong to your boys
Call me deaf' cause
I'm not hearing that noise



Yes!
Chicka-bow
Chicka-bow
Chicka bow wow wow
Blu Cantrell is hot
Hot
Redzone on fire!
