Oh in my gun I've got 6 shots
It's all fun and games 'till they hit opps
You know the bando is haunted aaahhh
You know the bando is haunted
My neighbours are pissed off
Bike wheels keep turnin'
Rubber rubber rubber burnin'
Ring ring on my graft phone
I got the punt(?) and it still serves it
Ay la' it's a massacre
With FTR 'cause we murder
Lil' man's got the rrr-bow
With the rrr-bow be a purger

I'm the type to get it done
I'll turn up at your ma's gaff
Like bitch wheres your son
Better bring him to this door
Before your skin-head gets done
Why you love runnin' them gums
That's why we're at your drum
Like ayy, get outside lad
The other side ain't bad
Two FTMers on a dirt bike
That's two members with waps
Look last week they had no dough
So this week they hit the graft
For the riches, fuck the rats
Pull up, hop out and bang
P-p-pull up, hop out and bang
All that shit it don't matter
I got twenty two in this wapper
And one thousand grams on your napper
Scouse trappin' Tremzy I'm a trapper
Oldschool hit a goldmine
Now little rats gonna hold nine
Look kid I know your history
You're a crack head like your old man
I just robbed your plug
Now I'm joggin', I'm joggin
In the graft house baggin' Os
Bag-baggin' up dozens
Now I'm joggin', I'm joggin
In the graft house baggin' Os
Bag-baggin' up dozens

Lil' man's got the rrr-bow
With the rrr-bow be a purger

The money's the root of the evil
We all still fuckin' love it
P-p-posted up with Makarov
That's my Russian cousin
Three to eight, old-school days
Four to five paranoid days
Sleepin' with that metal stake
R.I.P my brother Dray
I take these cougars on the daily
One's fourty-five and thirty-eight
Thirty-eight she cannot wait
She wants that food up on her plate
Fourty-five, she looks so shy
She wants that money out your safe
Both of them get what they want
Hit the move and skrr away

Rubber rubber rubber burnin'
Rubber rubber rubber burnin'
(Oh in my gun I've got 6 shots
It's all fun and games 'till they hit opps
You know the bando is haunted aaahhh
You know the bando is haunted aaahhh)
