Illuminate through this darkness
I'm preparing for the harvest of
Manifestations of my consciousness
All because my soul thought it up
And that's enough of your limitations
I'm fully embracing nothing but love
Replacing hesitation
With positive vibrations sent from up above

As above, so below
Spreading love everywhere that we go
An old soul transcending ego
In slow mo, I watch consciousness flow
I'm watching it grow and I want you to know
That your life has a purpose, your soul has a role
You're here to do what has never been done
So never run from the power you have to make change come
Yeah, and I see these times we're living in
This message I'm delivering got my body shivering
This position that we sitting in got me wishing that
We had all done more listening
To the elders who came before us
They've implored us, to heal all of our disorders
We can't see the forest, for the trees, these borders
Are keeping us from forward thinking and moving towards
A life of enlightenment
I'm inciting it
A new story's being told so I'm writing it
When these atoms explode they're colliding with
Each other to unfold life from infinite environments
And I'm deciding which, I'm aligning with
Cause life exists based on how we are defining it
I reminisce on the time when I was blinded with
A light made of bliss that showed me love is my entitlement
And now I'm climbing this mountain that we call the spirit
And I'm finding that the truth is there if you can hear it
You can steer it in a new direction from your heart
And connect it with your mind, then you will be taking off
So play your part
Make your mark
And find a new path for your soul to walk
And never stop
Living from your heart
Open up the door when your higher self knocks
Illuminate through this darkness
I'm preparing for the harvest of
Manifestations of my consciousness
All because my soul thought it up
And that's enough of your limitations
I'm fully embracing nothing but love
Replacing hesitation
With positive vibrations sent from up above

The temple of God is inside
I'll never hide
It's only in truth I confide
This merkaba's carrying light right through these dark times
Here to create and design
A life that's aligned with my purpose
To show that every human being breathing on this planet is worth it
The word is emanating from under the surface
Certain that it's breaking through to manifest courage
In every soul on this planet, love has been planted
So remove the veil that keeps us from understanding
And open up the sails to take us to the landing
With our arms open to accept what we have been handed
Cause we have been granted
This ability to grow, and forever expand our spirit's light as it glows
What we have been shown, is not the full picture, we can figure
Any vision into reality before we wither
Hithered only by our beliefs, in our minds what we see
In due time we will be, so set all the doubts free
How's it gonna be, focus on who you wanna be
Know this is a summary, of what our mind's been wondering
I know the doubts are creeping in, but we're leaving them
In the past because in the present we ain't needing them
All our goals and dreams we are meeting them, completing them
Staying focused throughout time until we are receiving them
Needing them, never, but it feels so much better
Cause fulfillment is forever here no matter the weather
Tethered to truth and love, you can never leave
When you see, where you are in this moment you are free
Cause it's your destiny, for your soul to create
So don't wait, or hesitate to enter this new mindstate
All the gates will open up when we ask them to
And as for you, whats your soul being asked to do?
What's your soul being asked to do?
What's your soul being asked to do?
