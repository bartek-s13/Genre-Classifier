Wait (what, what), foreign car (huh), in a 'Rari (skrrt, yeah)
Look at me, too fly for no thotty (I’m fly)
Anti everybody (anti), get high, get more money (get high)
Studio dark like a dungeon (hey), big rackaids, I’m thumbin’ (yeah)

Numbin’ froze my wrist (what), numbin’ froze my heart (yeah)
Two hoes walkin’, bring to the yacht, feel like Noah’s Ark
Gengar gleam from afar (what), chrome hearts, never take it off (yeah)
Greyhound, used to go hard (yeah), grabba in blunt, gettin’ tossed (woo)
Water my pockets, can’t walk, can’t stop, won’t stop, go hard like a robot (beep)
She a piece of art, I’m Mozart (hey), beat up her spine, the aura
Wait, hold up (what), she got a fatty, tip her over (yeah)
Might slide through on my loner (hey), then circle right back, do a donut (skrt)
Like a little dirt in the soda (drop), used to never wanna be a grownup (woo)
Made big boy bands and I glowed up (bands), she want all of me, hold the quarter (yeah)
She wanna cry all on my shoulder (what), I don’t even mean to control her (my bad)
Won’t get caught, gotta go, go, turbo, gotta hit the motor (yeah, yeah)

Foreign car (huh), in a 'Rari (skrrt, yeah)
Look at me, too fly for no thotty (I’m fly)
Anti everybody (anti), get high, get more money (get high)
Studio dark like a dungeon (hey), big rackaids, I’m thumbin’ (yeah)

I can’t fuck with you (you), you won’t fuck with me (with me)
Too much shit to lose, stay away, you dead to me (yeah)
I rock red rubies (what), two-two GSG (fa)
Two door Bumblebee (woah), came on the scene, have to speed
If I want it, I got all of it (yee, yee), my trophies are polishin’ (what)
Introvert, I’m not so talkative (shh, shh), no joke ting, no funny (hey)
Can’t trust nobody, still in the party, anti everybody
Scared money ain’t never made you no money, stay in my own booth, stay economics
Everywhere a man go, gang go with him (gang), hate gon’ spread like venom (huh)
We don’t do sentimentals, big body tank, everybody all in it (all in it)
Fuck other side, everybody come with ‘em, match my fly, can’t match this feeling
Smack on her ass and tell her good riddance, so anti, super slime like a villain
