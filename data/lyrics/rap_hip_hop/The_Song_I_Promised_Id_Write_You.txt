I always say I'll change my ways but I go back to the same old thangs
The percys and liquor always help with the pain cause I'm reminiscing 'bout the times when we used to go on cute bean dates
I always loved the way that you felt, any time I think about is it heaven or hell
I don't really know the answer but I wanna let you know how i felt
I loved you more than any single one of these girls and you know it's true
I'll admit I wasn't perfect and I got to close other girls that wasn't you
But I ain't never cheated on ya and I swear its the truth
I know you hearing things from all of my friends
Well ex friends cause they went and switch up too
Blaming me for all the sadness inside instead of telling the truth
Cause they know damn well that I did it all for you
Used to take you out on 5 star dates you could order anything get some steak on your plate
But you vegetarian so you don't eat that, maybe get some lobster with butter stack yeah
I know that you don't love me no more and it hurts bad but I gotta pull on through
Cause the thoughts of you being with another guys is driving me mad and makes me feel blue
I had connection with you something that I never felt before I was always scared to lose you if I'm being honest
And I said things that drove you away, and I'm sorry for dumb accusations I made
But i just didn't want your love to fade, well now I'm guessing that the shit is to late uh yeah
At least we have the memories right? At least we had the times I would hold you in my arms at night baby just hold on

Lately I've been feelin so drained I don't know if I'mma be okay
Levitate to a place in my brain where I think that I'll feel okay
Gravitate to the rain that event cause I know they all feel my pain
My energy will remain on this planet long after I drift away
Elevate, gravitate, levitate, won't hesitate, my own enemy, I levitate, I elevate, won't hesitate
