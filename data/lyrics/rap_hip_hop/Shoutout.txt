Shoutout to the money, love the drugs
Shoutout to the money from the drugs
It's just the drugs showin' money love
Shoutout to, shout-shoutout to
Shoutout to the money from the drugs
Shoutout to the money, love the drugs
Shoutout to the money from the drugs
Shoutout to the money, love the drugs

I need some money, I call my plug
She always showin' me extra love
She always throwin' me extra drugs
I don't ever be up in the club
I'm in the cut and I'm countin' up
Your bitch hit me when she need a dub
I told that ho, "get your money up, mane"
(Fuck is wrong with you)
Ay, but I'mma bust that play anyway
I don't turn down money any day
I don't got no job I work the stank
Bro ain't got no job he work the drank
Back in high school I would work the pills
These bitches rollin', I'm coppin' feels
Taxin' the lame, I ain't got no deals
Comin' where I'm from that shit was real
OG's be trappin' all out the wheels
All of the risk for the extra bills, mane
Most them bad bitches do blow for real
Can't spend the night cause them hoes'll steal

My weed's supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
We got abundance of drugs and you countin' your roaches
If the feds come in then don't tell them where all the dope is
Fuck around, land us in jail and now all of us hopeless
Talkin' 'bout how you get money, your jewelry bogus
My niggas told me to take over, I gotta stay focused
I finesse you, watch your bands and you won't even notice
I make it happen like magic, hocus pocus
Hit this bowl bitch cause I love it when you smokin'
She bustin' plays for daddy, that's a bonus
She told me that I'm the realest, I already noticed
Fill her with trojans that's magnum and golden, no I'm not proposin'
