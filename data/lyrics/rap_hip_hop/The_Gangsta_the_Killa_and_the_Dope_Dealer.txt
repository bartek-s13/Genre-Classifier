Hey, living in a California cage
Y'all trying to study me?
Gangbangin'll never die, it's too much love
You always gonna get niggas like us, you know what I mean
God damn
How many more motherfuckin' penitentiaries y'all gon' build?
How many jars you gonna try to put us in?
You know what I'm saying?

Killa Cali is the state, murda
Killa Cali is the state, murda
Killa Cali is the state, murda
Killa Cali is the state, murda

Can't none of y'all niggas fuck with none of these niggas
These triggers, we's killers (Hahaha)
Sittin' on the porch in between legs
With a bitch French-braiding my hair, nahhh!
Leave 'em til they matted forearm tatted
What's the Connection? Bitch, you looking at it
It don't stop, I hit mo' licks than it takes
To get to the center of a Blow pop (One, two, three)
And it's gonna take a miracle
To drive a car this color down Imperial
Yeah, I got heart
But ain't trying to see Marcia Clark (Punk ass nigga!)
So let's wait 'til it get dark
So many cars parked in my gate (*Beep-beep!*)
It's like the international, house of pancakes (Ugh!)
All on the grass (Ugh!), every bitch passed (Ugh!)
I'm first, not last, when we all hit the ass (Ahh)
Doin' tricks jacked up like a six (What!)
One pussy, and thirteen dicks
Gangstas don't dance, we boogie (Bow!)
Niggas run out and get ya cookie
Westside

Woo-WOO, woo-woo
Woo-WOO, woo-woo
Woo-WOO, woo-woo
Woo-WOO, woo-woo

Killa Cali is the state, murda
Killa Cali is the state, murda
Killa Cali is the state, murda (Murda!)
Killa Cali is the state, murda

Who's that dumpin' out that window, hoo-riding?
(West-Side!) Nobody survives when...
I got my steel up, throwing my shit up, pulling the trigger (Ugh)
What the fuck you lookin' at, nigga? (Punk!)
(*Whistles*) True blue when I bust
Leavin' bodies hangin' like the tongue of my Chucks
Chalk another one, homicidal in the G-ride
I swear I'm killing every nigga standing outside
Letting 'em have it, with my double barrel sawed off (Ugh!)
I'm smoking on everybody, niggas, bitches, and all
Stretch 'em out in broad daylight, motherfuck the witnesses
Eyes big as golf balls from the funny cigarette (Haha, yeah)
As the sun frowns on my foreheadt, I sweat murder (Murder!)
Which makes me the walking dead man
Bringing more bad news than Schleprock
When I bust shots (Ugh!), Dub-C keep the hammer cocked

The gangsta, the killa, and the dope dealer (Yeah!)
The gangsta, the killa, and the dope dealer (Yeah!)
The gangsta, the killa, and the dope dealer (Yeah!)
The gangsta, the killa, and the dope dealer (What's crackin'?!)

Well, it's the nigga that's housin' the scene
I got pounds of green and birds
Sittin' on the triple beams (Yes!)
I put it down on and off the record my flats a
Double decker, marble floors all checkered
Now what can I say every bitch I lay be pure and
Bombay like Peruvian ye
So I brag and I boast man I got the most, man (Whoa-whoa!)
I make more deliveries than the postman (B-I-ITCH!)
My homie Carlito plug me with the amigos
So, now, it's kilos, five and six double zeros
Now, what's next? I'm stuffed like Kotex
Blindin' niggas with the boogers in my Rolex
With my aces OT on a regular basis
We got pavé'd faces fightin' federal cases (Ha!)
Cause ain't nothin' reala' than niggas gettin' they scrilla
Like a gangsta, a killa, and Mack I'll be the dope dealer

Killa Cali is the state, murda (Murda!)
Killa Cali is the state, murda (Murda!)
Killa Cali is the state, murda (Murda!)
Killa Cali is the state, murda (Murda!)

The gangsta, the killa, and the dope dealer (Murda!)
The gangsta, the killa, and the dope dealer (Murda!)
The gangsta, the killa, and the dope dealer (Murda!)
The gangsta, the killa, and the dope dealer (Murda!)
The gangsta, the killa, and the dope dealer (Murda!)
The gangsta, the killa, and the dope dealer (Murda!)
The gangsta, the killa, and the dope dealer (Murda!)
The gangsta, the killa, and the dope dealer

Damn, it's a trip, haha
All these cameras goin up
I can't go here, I can't go there
I feel institutionalized
And I'm on the streets
