<<<<<<< HEAD
Welcome to the jungle
King of this shit, royal blood, welcome to the rumble
Every man for himself, Koko B Ware, in the square ya na
Inside the square circle cuz, curb your trust
If I kill us and rob us and serve us up

Snakes in the grass, give the turf a cut
Can't befriend then burgle us
Killing these bills, Uma Thurman'd up
Getting that belly like Sherman Klump
Show's over when the curtains shut
But mines are blinds and I'm turning up
Who are ya? Bet you heard of us
Big mic man like merciless
They say grime's not popping like it was back then
Rap's not honest like it was back then
When I get gassed in the booth like this
Niggas go bonkers like it was MAC-10
Roll Jack Jones if it ain't mandem
And again and again
Roll Jack Jones if it ain't mandem
Don't make money but it does make sense
Karmas of arsonist
Light up a dance like bars when there's sparklers
Out in Marms with an army of Dahms with us
Your clique, one bars, holy 
I be in  still they're going yard ya na
Rolling the rustlers, holy bivariate
Then I be back in East with the Gs
That ain't no gangsters, mate, that's the guv'nors
Sweet geez, ark at him
Cotching on Ermine Road where the barber's is
With a whole leap of man, yeah 'nough of us
You know them man that draw knife in an argument
That shamone, you're a man like it's nothing then
Come and round up the sticks like carpenters
You wanna squash that beef but it's started
Man’s at your door like “Would ya like to buy a carpet?”
Stick to the script
Real educated ignorant shit
Dom Perignon just to binge on the shit
Yo, if it bubbles, put your finger in it
White chicks fling G-strings when I spit
Blacker days, would've got lynched for this shit
Would've got whipped for this shit
Now I push a German Whip on a bitch
Now everybody wanna get Jigga rich quick
Want it handed to them likkle privileged kids
Hands in the cookie jar, ripping off riffs
I guess that's taking the flipping biscuit
Stealing a living with your sticky fingers
Crossing that pond and fishing for hits
We both gain from a little influence
But how comes nobody credits us Brits?
This ain't no RP cup of tea music
It's real east end theme music
No, I don't know the Queen
But that bitch stays in my jean pocket
No dubstepping on my toes
Don't fuck with my drum and bass
Shuffling to some council house
But it gets grimy in these raves
I've had dubplates on acetate
Dun know Kano was here
Used to shop in catalogs, now my catalog'll
Give these soundboys diarrhoea

Smash all of your CD rack
Won't get none of your CDs back
Smash all of your CD rack
Won't get none of your CDs back
Clear all of your CD rack
Won't get none of your CDs back
Smash all of your CD rack
