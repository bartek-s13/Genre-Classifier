Diamonds they lookin' like piss
Diamonds all up on my wrist
Yo bitch on my dick
She wanna go swallow my kids
I'm flippin' the brick till I'm breakin' my wrist, damn
I got the money believe me
Diamonds they shinin' they 3D
Water its Fiji
Gettin' the money so easy
Sayin' he bangin'
But this ain't no movie, aye
Hittin' the blunt and rip it
Bitch spin on dick call her fidget
Niggas they trippin'
Sayin' that they got the money
But look at my card and that bitch got no limit, aye
Look at my wrist it be cold
Look at my neck it's on froze
The coke in the rolls
She snortin' it up like some snow
That bitch getting wet and the pussy it glow, yuh
Wet, Wet, Wet, Wet, Wet, Wet, Wet, Wet
Wet, Wet, Wet, Wet, Wet, Wet, Wet, Wet

Bitch, you gon' suck it or not
Diamonds they all in my watch
I went and pop me a Perc
I go and move me some work
You talkin' that shit
You get put in the dirt
Gucci it's all on my shirt
I went and Balmained my jeans
I'm pourin' a 4 and I sip on the lean
She suck and then fuck and I bust in her mouth
Then she's gotta leave, oou
Music it's global like Dan
Bitch I've been poppin' the Xans
The Bape, it be straight from Japan
I'm movin' the white you can call me snowman
I'm countin' the bands, yuh
This has always been the plan
Gotta thank god for my blessing
I'm whippin' the Tesla
Please don't be so extra
I want it, I get it, I fight like a wrestler, uh, yea
