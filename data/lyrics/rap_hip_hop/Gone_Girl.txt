I fell in love, same time that you're fallin' (Yeah)

I fell in love, same time that you're fallin' apart
I should've known, thought I saw a sign in the stars
But I was wrong, fucking with you ain't last that long
Now you gone, now you gone, now you gone, girl

Tell me what it is, made my heart break
Saying that it's me, but you know it ain't
Took a few pills, I can't feel a thing
Got me in my feels, sippin' on drank
Tryna keep it real, girl, you really ain't
You know what's the deal, you can't get a thing
Saying that it hurts, tryin' to the game
Saying I'm a joke, laughin' to the bank

I need your love
I need your touch
I need you right now
I need you right now

I fell in love, same time that you're fallin' apart
I should've known, thought I saw a sign in the stars
But I was wrong, fucking with you ain't last that long
Now you gone, now you gone, now you gone, girl
I just want the love, baby, not the lust
Caught up in a daze, man, I need your trust
All up in a maze, left you in the dust
Gone in a wraith, see the stars in a wraith
You see the stars in the day, bitch
Have you been to Mars on a date, bitch?
I can take yo ass to Mars in a day, bitch
I can take yo ass to Mars today, bitch, yeah

I need your love
I need your touch
I need you right now (Yeah)
I need you right now (Yeah)

I fell in love, same time that you're fallin' apart
I should've known, thought I saw a sign in the stars
But I was wrong, fucking with you ain't last that long
