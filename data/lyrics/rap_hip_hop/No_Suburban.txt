I'm the reason why these niggas mad

Money coming fast, gotta chase a bag

Better recognize who you dealing with
Run up gun up, gon be a death
Leave a Blicky looking all sticky Drippy
Paramedics looking for his chest
Catch him time cause you know them
Blickys quickie Stupid niggas running with the best
Think they hiding all behind they stiff McQueen
You stupid
That's a scarf, it's not a vest
Give him 2,3 shots
Walk up on him point blank Hollow, chrome throw
TuTu gon free shots
I ain't even have to aim, Randy Moss throw
Watch me switch with the flow
Herbin niggas talking, talking, looking, causing show
Watch your bitch take the bros
Heard they plotting on your stupid ass for the dope
We don't spin in no Suburbans
Walk up gunning just to hurt em
Grab the Nina for the purging
Catch him sliding, its a murder
I ain't playing with you Gerbers
Frost gon roll up like he Herbert
Any Ceasar know it's scorching
Moving on em, steady scoring
Look
We just be lurking and seeing em
Free G Gil nigga
Shout out my nigga Trouble
He be on checkin em and preeing em
Shots at the top will fuck up
Have you seeing double
We get to lugging
They G'ing em
Trap out the spot
And bring guns
Gotta bleach the hundos
I catch em swerving in vehicles
Bet you they not shooting back
Watch his teammates crumble

I'm the reason why these niggas mad
We the reason why these niggas mad
Gang the reason why these niggas mad
Money coming fast, gotta chase a bag
I'm the reason why these niggas mad
We the reason why these niggas mad
Gang the reason why these niggas mad
Money coming fast, gotta chase a bag

Niggas watch, niggas lurk
Imma put his guys on a shirt
Then bend his block wit a...
Imma send him shots wit a...
Look, nigga money piling, they be hurting
Have my Locs slide down and burn him
Big bullets glide down and curl him
When a grey flag putting work in
Catch you with the Ls and we tote
Let them demons out in a joke
Catch him walking round with no pole
Have my hollows bop in his coat
Then my Franklin side leave him floating
And my Caton guys pull the curtain
All my niggas grinding for certain
Tre shots flying in his skirt
Moving Gang niggas do this
Moving Gang niggas shooters
Take your stash
I be looting Niggas chat, leave em snoozing
With a couple shots, we gon let him have it
My Third spin blocks
Watch em send free shots from the automatic
Send three shots
Make the Sergeant panic
Man the works lil 40 got a bass
So loud in this bitch
Toting no two, three rounds in the clip
Don't get shot down tryna slide on me bitch
Had to lay his ass down niggas blinding and shit
Call up Frost, airing out crowds with the shit
Ceasar hot, tearing down blocks with the tips
I done got way too hot with this shit
I should put the gat down but I ain't tryna slip
Let em know
We don't spin in no Suburbans
Walk up gunning just to hurt em
Grab the Nina for the purging
Catch him sliding, its a murder
I ain't playing with you Gerbers
Frost gon roll up like he Herbert
Any Ceasar know it's scorching
Moving on em, steady scoring
