You told me there's no need
To talk it out 'cause it's too late
To proceed, and slowly
I took your words and walked away
No looking back, I won't regret, no
I will find my way
I'm broken, but still I have to say

It's alright, OK, I'm so much better without you
I won't be sorry
Alright, OK, so don't you bother what I do
No matter what you say
I won't return, our bridge has burned down
I'm stronger now
Alright, OK, I'm so much better without you
I won't be sorry

You played me, betrayed me
Your love was nothing but a game
Portrayed a role, you took control
I, I couldn't help but fall
So deep, but now I see things clear
It's alright, OK, I'm so much better without you
I won't be sorry
Alright, OK, so don't you bother what I do
No matter what you say
I won't return, our bridge has burned down
I'm stronger now
Alright, OK, I'm so much better without you
I won't be sorry

Don't waste your fiction tears on me
Just save them for someone in need
It's way too late, I'm closing the door

It's alright, OK, I'm so much better without you
I won't be sorry
It's alright, OK, so don't you bother what I do, yeah
No matter what you say (No matter what you say)
I won't return, our bridge has burned down
I'm stronger now
Alright, OK, I'm so much better without you
(I'm better without you)
I won't be sorry
It's alright, OK, alright, OK
Without you, no matter what you say
It's alright, OK, alright, OK
Without you, I won't be sorry
