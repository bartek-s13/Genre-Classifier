I知 living better now
I know you had your doubts
Tell em we good
No need to be stressing out
Use to sleep on the couch, yeah yeah
No food to put in my mouth, yeah yeah
I知 living better now, yeah yeah
I知 living better now, yeah yeah
Ohhhh
I知 living better now
I知 living better now
I知 living better now
I知 living better now
Use to be down and out
Just got me a bigger house
I知 living better now, yeah yeah
I知 living better now
I知 living better now
Turned myself to a cash cow
Had no time for waiting
I got to get rich now
And just being average is something I can稚 allow
Just so you remember
We weren稚 the first man that take a bow
Coming from Kings and Queens
We the new slaves
Shit is obscene
So much drugs and liquor, huh
He really acting like he winning
Acting like he worth billions
But niggas penny pinching
They just mad
I just got my whole city riffing
Saw the outcome
Now they all wishing
I知 living better now
I know you had your doubts
Tell em we good
No need to be stressing out
Use to sleep on the couch, yeah yeah
No food to put in my mouth, yeah yeah
I知 living better now, yeah yeah
I知 living better now, yeah yeah
Ohhhh
I知 living better now
I知 living better now
I知 living better now
I知 living better now
Use to be down and out
Just got me a bigger house
I知 living better now, yeah yeah
I知 living better now
Ain稚 no more sleep on the couch
The air on either you in or you out
Population ain't crowded
And my neighbors ain稚 even loud
Ain稚 no more old days
But i still listen to ol jays
So caught up in my new ways
Gotta mix old school with the new wave
And still bounce
Still get that feel
Riding that drop top
Like life ain't real
That's how I feel
I知 living better now
Ain't no holes in my sweater now
Life goes up we don't let it down
Let the beat play
Ain't no turning down
Turning down
I知 living better now
I know you had your doubts
Tell em we good
No need to be stressing out
Use to sleep on the couch, yeah yeah
No food to put in my mouth, yeah yeah
I知 living better now, yeah yeah
I知 living better now, yeah yeah
Eh, Eh

Lot people wanted me to fall
All the things we致e been through you don't know
Now look at me
