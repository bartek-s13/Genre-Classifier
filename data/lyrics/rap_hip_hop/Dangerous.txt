Yung Lan on the track

We got mob ties
I ain't seen the sun rise since my dawg died
Bring that nigga back to me, I want him hogtied
Can't slide for me without a body, you ain't certified
No, you can't hang with us, you can't hang with us
You ain't gon' bang for us, you ain't bang with us
They know we dangerous, we so dangerous
They know we dangerous, turn a nigga to angel dust, yeah yeah

These niggas ain't the same as us
Them niggas green, they ain't share the same pain as us
For cool points, I know niggas'll bust a brain for us
Don't slide to run to Instagram, 'cause that shit lame to us
Don't feed into the bullshit, won't get no fame from us
And I'm that same young nigga, know I won't change for nothin'
You know they hate to see you shinin' when you came from nothin'
Might drop a bag on some diamonds, bitch, come take it from me
I got some shooters, bust that drake until it stop spittin'
Only the strong survive, that's why some of the opps dead
Told my brother I won't be satisfied until they knock me
Another day, another homicide, that's how I be feelin'
We got mob ties
I ain't seen the sun rise since my dawg died
Bring that nigga back to me, I want him hogtied
Can't slide for me without a body, you ain't certified
No, you can't hang with us, you can't hang with us
You ain't gon' bang for us, you ain't bang with us
They know we dangerous, we so dangerous
They know we dangerous, turn a nigga to angel dust, yeah yeah

KOBK, so we just got a K
My brother stressin', he just caught a case
Opps die, we celebrate like a holiday
We know the truth but that's on you, that's all I can say
Tit-for-tat, strap for strap, that's how I like to play
Fall back and fade away like I'm Mike and J
They know we got that Miley Cyrus like I'm Billy Ray
They say it cost to be the boss, you know the price to pay
Head-busters and drug dealers, I hang with 'em
Ain't want that shit around me but it just came with 'em
I know a lot of niggas died, let that fame kill 'em
Want attention, we gon' hit 'em with them pain killers

We got mob ties
I ain't seen the sun rise since my dawg died
Bring that nigga back to me, I want him hogtied
Can't slide for me without a body, you ain't certified
No, you can't hang with us, you can't hang with us
You ain't gon' bang for us, you ain't bang with us
They know we dangerous, we so dangerous
