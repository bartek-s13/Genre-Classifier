I used to be great at drinking, but now I'm great at nothing (noth-)
Right off of my 2nd shot and I'm already blushing (blush)
Or maybe it's because our hands are maybe-kind-of touching
On 2nd thought I'm really-really good at falling in love
Singing the blues
All afternoon
Brown in the booze
But a rainbow in you

I don't know what-
What to tell you
I'm not perfect-
Don't have to tell you
And I'm fucked up
By more than booze
But maybe if I had someone like you

'Cause I don't wanna wake up
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Oo-Woah-Oh
And I don't wanna wake up
And I don't wanna wake up
Unless it's inside your arms
I am loved or I'm lost

And I believe
There's a place for me;
Is it weird of me to say:
Hey let's make a rom-com
Drawn to the songs once you appear
Dawn is the wrong sun
On one, I guess, just tryna make sense
And uh, yes, I know we just met but
3 AM and vans that I dance in
Lovely eyes and hands that I dance with
Get a van, and find some new lands and-
It's only crazy if we don't do it... right?

I don't - I don't know what-
What to - What to tell you
I'm not - I'm not perfect-
Don't - Don't have to tell you
And I'm - And I'm fucked up
By more than booze
But maybe if I had someone like you
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Oo-Woah-Oh
And I don't wanna wake up
And I don't wanna wake up
Unless it's inside your arms
I am loved or I'm lost

And maybe I'm a fool (yeah)
But there's not much that I think
Maybe it's the booze in my heart
But if you know me the drink
Ends up a means (ends up a means)
A friend's what I need (A friend's what I need)
I speak what I bleed (I speak what I bleed)
I believe there's a place for me ('Cause baby)
I believe (I believe)
There's a place for me (Place for me)
'Cause baby I believe (I believe)
It's wherever you will be
Wah-ah-ahhhh
I don't - I don't know what- (Know what)
What to - What to tell you (Tell you)
I'm not - I'm not perfect- (Perfect)
Don't - Don't have to tell you (Tell you)
And I'm - And I'm fucked up (Fucked up)
By more than booze, (Oooo-ohhh, woah-oh)
But maybe if I had someone like you

'Cause I don't wanna wake up
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Oo-Woah-Oh
And I don't wanna wake up
And I don't wanna wake up
Unless it's inside your arms
I am loved or I'm lost
