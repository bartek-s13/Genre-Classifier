I could hear them howling from afar
I saw them rushing to your car
In a moment all went screaming wild
Until the darkness killed the light

I remember running to the sea
The burning houses and the trees
I remember running to the sea
Alone and blinded by the fear

And the river flows beneath your skin
Like savage horses kept within
And all is wasted in the sand
Like breaking diamonds with your hand

I remember running to the sea
Remember falling to my knees
I remember gliding off the shore
Until I touched the ocean floor

And the river flows beneath your skin
Like savage horses kept within
And all is wasted in the sand
Like breaking diamonds with your hand

And the river grows inside of me
And the river grows inside of me
And the river grows inside of me
