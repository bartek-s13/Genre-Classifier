MKThePlug
Said it come black like—
It's long, and that's—
I turn white T's Japan
Lurk, lurk, search, destroy
This ain't a toy, u-u-up—
Sammy come black like dye, it's long, and that's facts
Don't dash, I turn white T's...
Ayy, come here

Lurk, lurk, search, destroy (Destroy), samurai gon' touch this boy (Splash)
This—this ain't a toy (No chance), up it and get destroyed (Bow, bow)
Sammy come black like dye, it's long, and that's facts (Facts)
Do—don't dash, I turn white T's Japan (Splash)
Lurk, lurk, search, destroy (Destroy), samurai gon' touch this boy (They know)
This—this ain't a toy (No chance), up it and get destroyed (Bow, bow)
Sammy come black like dye (Ayy), it's long, and that's facts (They know, facts)
Don't dash (Ayy, come here), I turn white T's Japan (Splash)

Konnichiwa, it's the Homerton Sensei, hop out the ride, this shank ain't bending
Can't escape these bullets like Boris (Bow), watch his soul take off like Heathrow (Gone)
Call me the Grim Reaper (Ayy), I'll take man out, I'm evil (They know)
No stunts like Knievel, in the 9, I'm known as the hero
Send my young—send my young boy over there on a mission, you're a spy, keep it hidden (Shh)
Mission confirmed, roger, over (Confirmed), got the drop and the yout' got soaked up (Ching, ching)
Tryna leave him road on brizz, these yout's are taking the piss (They're taking the piss)
You try take that risk (Huh), came round and got chinged
And I see man run with their babes, bake off, you don't hit ribbon
'Cause—'cause she's an opp, she can hold these feds, I ain't kidding
I'm in—in a ride that's hidden (Shh). see opps, it turns hideous (Ayy)
It's ridiculous, how them man catch life, I'm sick of it (How?)
Couple man got cribbed for the block, they ain't doing shit for the cause
The—the—they're—they're lost, they go draw and beef these punks
And dare man come to my block, that's holes in tops
Lurk, lurk, search, destroy (Destroy), samurai gon' touch this boy (Splash)
This—this ain't a toy (No chance), up it and get destroyed (Bow, bow)
Sammy come black like dye (Ayy), it's long, and that's facts (They know, facts)

How many times have I lost my mind?
I'll rip out my sharingan, back that, my shank tryna take man's life (Ching)
I want M on M's, but they think I'm nuts so I put shank in guts, hop out the four-door truck
Try turn man Neji (Deadout)
Them man ain't ready, no beam, hold it steady (Bow, bow)
Let that off, watch man turn jelly
P.O.P, I'm holding it down, officer, I'm legally blind
I don't—I don't know nothing 'bout snitching, but they do, dumb victims (Dumb)
Ching man down in rhythm (Ching, ching), I'm sickened by the liquid (Damn)
V9 too fierce, I run a man down hoping I kill him
Drillin' (Brr), he's finished, and the Sammy come long like Limits
Dotty come fat like Bills, one phone call, burst through, it's a drill
V9 the Akuma, please don't let me shoot ya, bells looking like CTP, best pull up their pants and breeze (Ayy, come here)
Or heads go red like Reggie, or heads go red like Reggie
Lurk, lurk, search, destroy (Destroy), samurai gon' touch this boy (Splash)
This—this ain't a toy (No chance), up it and get destroyed (Bow, bow)
Sammy come black like dye (Ayy), it's long, and that's facts (They know, facts)
