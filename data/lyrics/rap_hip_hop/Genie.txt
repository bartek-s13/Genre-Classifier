Three nines
I wish, I wish, I wish
Ready

Turning tides like I'm in the sea
Waverider, I make boatloads my pay high, you can just stay tied
'Cause the past year's been fast asleep, oh, you want weekly salary
But the stress alone burn my calories, stress alone burn my calories
Vibe out on the side, yeah, crime all in my life, yeah
Gemini are two-faced, whoa, couldn't read all the signs, yeah
Still off on the same smoke, hotboxin' the range rover
She say what I say ain't right, lemme explain it
I just use it, numb the pain at times, it leave me brainless
New girls and their Calvin Klein, look who got famous
That same pussy poppin' on my iPhone
And I turn around 'cause all my bygones do mean goodbye
Wish, I wish, I wish
You sound like my old car, that shit won't ever start again (Shut up)
Make sure you walk on water 'fore you try and burn that bridge, Sink that ship (Whoa, whoa), inside, yeah, inside, yeah

I'm talkin' fake nice, get my pay right
Reminiscin' what she say right, if the pay right (Grant your wishes)
I'm talkin' fake nice, get my pay right
Inside, yeah, inside, yeah
Hole in my heart like cryo, came up with the link in my bio
Pretending I never existed, then hit me like "it's been a while"
Wish I had nowhere to be, I wish I could think better titles
Oh, you want ice on your teeth? I wish I could summon a smile
Lost game with a price tag and we copped it
Cash cloudin' my optics from the pocket
One spawned and I'd watch it when you cross me, yeah I caught it
Bow down to your prophet, I am just part of the profit (Yeah)
Do me until I'm in coffin and the feelin' inside, dreamy world

I'm talkin fake nice, get my pay right
Reminiscin' what she say right, if the pay right (Grant your wishes)
I'm talkin fake nice, get my pay right
Inside, yeah, inside, yeah

She made it, easy I fall
Wish, I wish, I wish
She made it, easy I fall
Inside, yeah, inside, yeah
I wish I didn't feel so bad
And if you ever end up seeing what I do
I wish you'd never ever catch me, you should know that
It's not much more to understand about you
Maybe one day you'll get me
She made it, easy I fall
