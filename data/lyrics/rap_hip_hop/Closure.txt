Carousel, back around and you go again
One too many times, I'm off now, it's the end
Carousel, back around and you go again
I was down to ride but no, no, no
I can't win with you

If it's over, then it's over
Do not hit my line just 'cause you need closure
You said it yourself, you don't want me
Now I'm fine on my own, and you're lonely
If it's over, then it's over
Do not hit my line just 'cause you need closure
You said it yourself, you don't want me
Now I'm fine on my own, and you're lonely

Here we go, here we go again
I can't let it go, leave it in the past
I guess we'll never know, what we could've been
Never give my love back to you again
If you think I'm coming back, no I'm not, no, I'm not sorry
I'm not giving in, so, baby, do not bother calling
What was going through your head?
What'd you think I'd say?
Can't stand to see your face
Tired of your games
Carousel, back around and you go again
One too many times, I'm off now, it's the end
Carousel, back around and you go again
I was down to ride but no, no, no
I can't win with you

If it's over, then it's over
Do not hit my line just 'cause you need closure
You said it yourself, you don't want me
Now I'm fine on my own, and you're lonely
If it's over, then it's over
Do not hit my line just 'cause you need closure
You said it yourself, you don't want me
Now I'm fine on my own, and you're lonely

Just 'cause I tripped over your lies
So many times, doesn't mean I'm gonna let it happen again
Go ahead, talk shit to your friends
No, it don't bother me
No maybes girl no probablys
You claiming that you changed
Say you're down for me
But I'm not falling for that
Carousel, back around and you go again
One too many times, I'm off now, it's the end
Carousel, back around and you go again
I was down to ride but no, no, no
I can't win with you

If it's over, then it's over
Do not hit my line just 'cause you need closure
You said it yourself, you don't want me
Now I'm fine on my own, and you're lonely
If it's over, then it's over
Do not hit my line just 'cause you need closure
You said it yourself, you don't want me
