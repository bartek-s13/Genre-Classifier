Yeah
Ayo, I'm backstage, 4 Your Eyez Only in my city
This a God thing
Shout goes out to J.I.D, he's a motherfuckin' madman
Me? I'm a Superman, a Iron Man, a Batman
One time for the Batman
Remember I’m the little nigga runnin' around that J
Every time I turn my back around a nigga hate
So I left the city, made a move out to the A
They ask if he straight hell nah that nigga great
Girl you can’t control shit round here, please get the fuck back
Pretty penny ain’t worth shit, had to dead that
P-D-S-Y, up next, workaholics
And me I need a Rolex, Deshawn he need a Rolex
I gets whatever I get make sure my bro get
Believe me if I’m eating, we got the itis
No touch we talking new mils, I got the Midas (bling)
Do this, just like two clips I’m out here grinding

This is not a I thing, it's a we thing
It's a team thing
This is not a I thing, it's the green mane
Get the green mane
This is not a I thing, it's a we thing
It's a team thing
This is not a I thing, it's the green mane
Get the green mane
If every nigga in your clique is rich, your clique is rugged
No one would fall 'cause everyone would be each other's crutches
I heard the word, I had to see for myself
I was struggling on my own, I had to go get some help
And ain't nothing wrong with that (Ain't nothin' wrong)
This is the real, I cannot chill
I got a song for that (I got two)
When I got the ball, relax
I pass the ball, it's action
I know these hoes distractions
I know these hoes is cancer
I know these hoes is fake
Get off my dick like Cole said
All I'm tryna do is count bread
Workin' on my portfolio till it's a full folder
Now back to the city, we can go there
All my little niggas gon' grow there
All my little niggas gon' shine there 'cause all my little niggas grind there

This is not a I thing, it's a we thing
It's a team thing
This is not a I thing, it's the green mane
Get the green mane
This is not a I thing, it's a we thing
It's a team thing
This is not a I thing, it's the green mane
