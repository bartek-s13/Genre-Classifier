I feel like shit about to change soon, still on liquor
As I sit in this same room with slept on vision
Hard drive full of missiles, finna blow ya'll mission
Still bucking from checks from folks that ate out my kitchen
I guarantee she wanna turn up with me now
All them caps lock tense, and all them calls that get ignored
Yeah, homie it's like that
They want him home, they want him humble
Homie what's like that?
But I ain't going back to broke, dying 'cause my pops won't let borrow none from folks
Be damned, I got the glow like Golden State then fucking choke
You got hate in your soul
Boom, blow, pow, God hit 'em with the bliss
Boom, blow, pow, lil bitch I'm up next

Yeah, look, you deserve it when you work for it
Knees in the dirt, hands to Lord, know you prayed for it
Two times, niggas slept on you just like futon
You grind, 5 AM while everybody snooze
I'm loose, now, now, now
Cause your dreams, dreams right there
And tell that hating nigga "no, no, no"
No nightmares
Shout out to all the girls that go through mad shit
Remember when it was just me and you on mattress
I need the rent, but didn't even want to ask for it
You stay and make it work even though we class a bit
You know I'm probably gon' die with you
Know I'm here to inspire you
Spite of what you be going through, I gotta fight off your fires too
Dalmatian of firefighter, you know I'm gon' ride with you
We set the foundation and then we do like a cloud do
You know like a owl do, I mean like a bird do
Might be attracted to some, but you know I prefer you
I love what your mind do and I love what them curves do
I wake up in morning and know my dreams right there

Yeah, look, you deserve it when you work for it
Knees in the dirt, hands to Lord, know you prayed for it
Two times, niggas slept on you just like futon
You grind, 5 AM while everybody snooze
I'm loose, now, now, now
Cause your dreams, dreams right there
And tell that hating nigga "no, no, no"
No nightmares

If anybody ever doubt it, just let 'em know that you up now
You up now, don't hit me up now
If she forever proud about you, make sure you lift her up now
Lift her up now
If anybody ever doubt it, just let 'em know that you up now
You up now, don't hit me up now
If she forever proud about you, make sure you lift her up now
Lift her up now
Yeah, look, you deserve it when you work for it
Knees in the dirt, hands to Lord, know you prayed for it
Two times, niggas slept on you just like futon
You grind, 5 AM while everybody snooze
I'm loose, now, now, now
Cause your dreams, dreams right there
And tell that hating nigga "no, no, no"
No nightmares
