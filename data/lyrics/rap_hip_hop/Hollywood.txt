This shit left me shell shocked and traumatized
It's hard to speak on what I'm feeling up inside
I can't even look my mama in her eyes
I put you through so much and I apologize
I'm cashing checks I hope these hunnids stop the crying
Where I'm from they only love you when you die
I'm from the trenches where we fighting to survive
Can't be another victim of these homicides

And you can't even show too much love, or they get greedy
The same niggas ain’t give a fuck, saying don't leave me
For my niggas I wrote this one in blood, I know you see me
It ain't no turning back they went too far so fuck a treaty
Phone on airplane mode, I'm too high up for you to reach me
I been too busy chasing my dreams, I'm never sleepy
Catch us at the awards like look mama I'm on TV
I'm just tryna make my mark in this shit, like Pac or Weezy
I can tell by the look in your eyes, you probably need me
But it's a lot of girls that's attractive, what can you teach me?
And is you gon' stick around or say fuck me when this ain't easy?
It be the ones that you least expected, I swear this shit it get greasy

This shit left me shell shocked and traumatized
It's hard to speak on what I'm feeling up inside
I can't even look my mama in her eyes
I put you through so much and I apologize
I'm cashing checks I hope these hunnids stop the crying
Where I'm from they only love you when you die
I'm from the trenches where we fighting to survive
Can't be another victim of these homicides
My lil' niggas some demons, they be quick to let it spark
We was shorties on the block, we wasn't playing in the park
Granny say whatever you do, just play it smart
I keep getting tatted, just to cover up the scars
I'm just tryna shine and fight my way up out the dark
We like royalty, kings is what we are
I just plan on chasing my dreams and going far
Gotta think big if you plan on living large
Tryna look on Billboard and see my name up on them charts
I walk up in the stu' and put my soul in every bar
Whole team gotta eat, we filling up the shopping cart
And you can't grab a plate if you weren't right here from the start

This shit left me shell shocked and traumatized
It's hard to speak on what I'm feeling up inside
I can't even look my mama in her eyes
I put you through so much and I apologize
I'm cashing checks I hope these hunnids stop the crying
Where I'm from they only love you when you die
I'm from the trenches where we fighting to survive
Can't be another victim of these homicides
