Yeah
Hardy Caprio, South London Croydon
Big up Daniel Bedingfield you get me?
Don't trust me, I'm booky
They wanna know what I'm on, unruly
I do grime, do rap, do ends, do uni
And when I'm back in Croydon I'm making a movie
Come a long way from opps, I'm a BB saying don't shoot me rah
Man wanna ghost yours truly
But I'm still in one piece like Luffy
I like calm, I don't like nothing bougie
Bucket hat, black tee, black jeans
Maybe the rips but nothing too fruity
I never dress to impress for them girls love me like movies, talking and movies
I ain't got no space for a groupie
They wanna go on things, thats boring
Girls come straight here, thats coolie-o
Can't ask me "What are we?", we're done
Back to the funds
Me and Sam out on the road where goes we grind like 
But see them man, they're right on their bums
See them man, they're nice to their mums
We're outchere, I'm on a different flex
I'm active, I never see them go but them man love popup like LiveJasmin
I'm old school like Bebo edits, I'm on the road now please don't gem it
I saw your message on the reddit but I never got back, I'm calmer
Never gotta beg it
Had that girl tryna beat but I didn't
Cause I don't wanna beat if I know I can get it
Man don't get it, they're just roasting, man don't get it
Yo
I've been done with the ends, but I had withdrawals
Cash withdrawals, bank withdrawals
Might just phone uncle for the big ting
Me and the maid get mad informal
I put down my phone, pick up my coat
Get out the door and hop in the whip I'm gone
Mans got a link in narn but
Give them a inch and man wanna know wah wah wahgwarn
Hop out the whip what's good wahgwarn
Mans been here for a set, what's happening
Get that shit hurry up wahgwarn
Can't gas me I'm hardly impressed
I won't go broke for narni and bress
I'm stingy, I can't be in debt
My shit bands 
Now make one hit like Trinidad James
 ain't shit, I can give her mad game
Never got hats but a likkle man chain
I was young, man got likkle man change
Now these girls that would dig a man's name, they're hurt
And they wanna dig a man's name
Can't do Bryson Tiller, I ain't this
Bands on my head like Nelly when Kelly
I fade
I'm older, I'm not younger
I do girls, 21, no under
Dead tings wanna ring up my number
So no way man never give a bumba
I'm older, I'm no younger
I do girls, 21, not under
Dead tings wanna ring up my number
But I'm not Tyrese, yo
I'm not Tyrese, I'm not Usher
I won't take that girl, won't cuff her
I like her for the bress and the bumper
She like me cah I'm next with the bumba
I'm not Tyrese, I'm not Usher
I won't take that girl, I don't trust her
I like her for the bress and the bumper
That girl, she a ho, she a jez, she a badders yeah
