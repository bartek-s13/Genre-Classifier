Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah
Watch the weather change

Watch the weather change
You don't know my pain
We cannot relate
Three diamond rings
Feel like Shabba Ranks
Watch the weather change
You pull up in a coupe, I pull up in a tank
Better know my name
I don't play no games
I don't pay for weed but I pay the price of fame
No there's no escape, can't run away
This my every day, bitch I live this every day

You should be ashamed, looking like a stain
Trip to LA, molly made me sane
Bitch I woke up in LA, now they call my name
Now they know my name when I walk up in the place
Walk in party late, lot on my plate
I just want to eat, feed the whole gang
The clock hits twelve and the sun goes down
And the ghouls come out
Couple people ridin' want to pass me
Pussy boy snail, I'm an athlete
Leave 'em in my trail, leave 'em dusty
Chasing on my tail like a track meet
Money coming plenty
Money coming steady
Pockets so fat, heavy
Pockets chubby, hefty
My right hand started moving lefty
Started eating good still on empty
'Cause I got lots of friends that be enemies
That wanna follow me to get ahead of me
Watch the weather change
You don't know my pain
We cannot relate
Three diamond rings
Feel like Shabba Ranks
Watch the weather change
You pull up in a coupe, I pull up in a tank
Better know my name
I don't play no games
I don't pay for weed but I pay the price of fame
No there's no escape, can't run away
This my every day, bitch I live this every day
Watch the weather change
You don't know my pain
We cannot relate
Three diamond rings
Feel like Shabba Ranks
Watch the weather change
You pull up in a coupe, I pull up in a tank

My right hand started moving lefty
