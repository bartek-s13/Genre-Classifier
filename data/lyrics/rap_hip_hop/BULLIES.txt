Baby on my hit list, I'm excited
God got me to protect, it's a Friday
Don't talk fake deep, I don't like it
Don't talk fake deep (To me), I don't like it
Baby on my hit list, I'm excited
God got me to protect, it's a Friday
Don't talk fake deep, I don't like it
Don't talk fake deep (To me), I don't like it
Let's go

Tell baby I'm coming home
Bless me, I've been on my own
You can love me and still do me wrong
I've been hurt but I still remain strong
How many times I show face and shit go south on me?
I had a kickstand last year, but she ain't really love me
Y'all better leave me alone
If I have to pull up, I'll be

Baby on my hit list, I'm excited (Hey)

Don't talk fake deep, I don't like it
Don't talk fake (To me) deep, I don't like it

Don't talk fake deep, I don't like it

(Hey) Let's go

I hurt your feelings for a fool
You know these facts, your love is tall
Worth more than millions fold
I save your heart, I play the part
I miss your kisses, okay (Hm)
Y'all better leave me alone
No one need me
I pop like genie
You don't wanna see me
Duckin' enemies
Ex one look like RiRi
I'm not a weakling
