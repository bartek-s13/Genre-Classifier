I put the squeeze on the trigger
And if you please, I'll make it bigger
And if it feels automatic
You know that you've got to have it
Crazy...
You're driving me crazy
I put the squeeze on the trigger
And if you plea here's your fingers
When this is reaching over all
I think it's time to lose control
Crazy...
You're driving me crazy
You're driving me crazy
You're driving me crazy
So come on play me, yeah
I need you to save me, yeah
So come on, ease this wah-wah head of mine
Load it up and make it blind
Crazy...
You're driving me crazy
You're making me crazy
Crazy. Crazy
I put the squeeze on the trigger
And if you please, I'll make it bigger
And if it feels automatic
You know that you've got to have it
I put the squeeze on the trigger
Kiss the steel and take you with her
Feeling that this had to come
No apologies for what I've done
Baby...
You're driving me crazy
You're driving me crazy
You're driving me crazy
So come on play me, yeah
I need you to save me, yeah
So come on, ease this wah-wah head of mine
Load it up and make it blind
Crazy...
You're driving me crazy
Crazy...
You're driving me crazy

So come on, ease this wah-wah head of mine
Load it up and make it blind
