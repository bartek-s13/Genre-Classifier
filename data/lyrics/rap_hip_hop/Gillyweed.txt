How you talking like you knew about my living at all
We went and won up in the winter while they stuck in the fall
December got em acting nervous like when I'm at the mall
Cause everybody looking at me like they expecting a call
And I ain't got the coverage
And we ain't have a budget
Just stayed stacking steady laughing while they called us youngins
She got that hourglass body then you know we fucking
How many times I gotta tell you that my time is coming
Been moving on from things that passed in my life
Don't let your heart trick your mind into doing what's right
I drink my rights into wrongs by the end of the night
So don't think and just write was the greatest advice

She really saying to my face it ain't about who you know
And she in college for the shit I already learned on my own
Asking "how come you ain't made it??, you should study the coles"
It ain't a dollar to dream unless you fucking with hov

Hook:
And that just how it go
We all playing the game
We all out for the gold
We all out for the fame
I ball out in the cold
I ball out in the rain
It don't matter the goal
We all numbing the pain
X2

How the lights turning on
If I ain't twisting the bulb
Pray the pain go away
Novacane in my skull
Sold my life for a dream
Sold your dream for a soul
Michael Phelps with the love
Sold my heart for the gold
Its like the
Same times turn the same page
Same story its the same day
A week later in the same place
A year gone think I’m insane
I can’t function at the function unless I’m fucked up
And you the first person that I think of when I wake up
I guess that means I’m fucking up my feelings and my paystubs
And they said that I’m crazy maybe that shit wasn’t made up
I keep on waking up and hustling on the same shit
They love you when you up but when you falling they go change quick
A million in mind can’t stop the bullets when my brain slip
The feelings turn fire fully faded when the days end
Hundreds in my heart can’t pay the prices at the days inn
And lately I be getting worried, wondering where I’m staying
I'm tired of all the questions and just paying for the same shit
My borealis dreams got your girl give me brain quick
Some coffee Mary j go get me through the fucking day
The slang throwing runaway can't tell me that I ever changed
My life longer then I thought it’d be, got good at dodging my mistakes
Don;t ever let the ones above you hold you in your fucking place
Hook:
And that just how it go
We all playing the game
We all out for the gold
We all out for the fame
I ball out in the cold
I ball out in the rain
It don't matter the goal
We all numbing the pain
