Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap
Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap

A fresh start's all I need as I'm gargling bleach
Will this get my chakras all clean?
Hope so, soap, soap, my love could use a lather
Morals mixed with mud need a scrub
Blow away my bones with a bath bomb
Sentence me to sop in the suds
Feel like I need to shower for eternity
Society so dirty, someone get me clean internally
Wash me in detergent 'til it's burning me
Water boilin', joining her in serving me the third degree
She's right, I mean, I'm surely better than her last man
Probably better than her next man too
But these taunting tainted tracks I've marched,
Left the bottoms of my feet so black like tar

Tar in my lungs, soap
Tar in my lungs, soap
Soap, soap
Soap, C'mon, soap

I guess that I regret what I said now I'm sober
(Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap)
Do they have Head and Shoulders for inside your head and your soul or
(Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap)
Do I need a cleanse that'll foam up?
Anything to end this aroma
'Cause it smell foul from the language
Scrub me from the inside out like you're painting
Scrub me from the inside out
Brush me from the inside out

I feel stained from the smoke
Think my brain need a bathtub
Think my veins need to soak
Lemme drain all the bad blood
Let these bars clean (no soap)
Let your heart bleed (no thanks)
Secrets haunt me (no ghost)
Lemme come clean (no chance)
We stay out late
But when we fill up, we don't fill up like a gas tank
We fill up like an ashtray
She's real and blunt, she cut up me up
Feel like she spilled my guts on the park bench
Pardon me darlin', I guess I left that part of me
Sparta imparted in the Garden State, still charming
But darkened is being hardened involved in evolving Darwin
Spark restart it, get this soap by the carton
Just for all you starving artists, eat this soap by the carton
Just for all you starving-

I guess that I regret what I said now I'm sober
(Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap)
Do they have Head and Shoulders for inside your head and your soul or
(Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap)
Do I need a cleanse that'll foam up?
Anything to end this aroma
'Cause it smell foul from the language
Scrub me from the inside out like you're painting
