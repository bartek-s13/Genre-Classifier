Oi, chick, I gotta dip for a bit
'Cause my shit's so sick, I'm making quids for a vid
So, quick slip, I just blitz through the bits
Arrive at the destination like I'm rich in the bitch
Your boats sailing, now I'm sinking your ship
I'm not thinking I'm sick, I just literally is
Them man are stood hating while they're pickin' the spliff
I'ma rip him to bits, while I build up my quids
Originality is key, I've more than mastered it
They didn't like admitting that I'm sick because they're flapping it
Dropped "Straight Rhymez," the vibes nuttin' but nice
I know little white kids and man in prison who are blasting it
It's nuttin', all the Manny bees are buzzing
Big up Rags, that's big bro'
Hella Manny man are coming
I'm tryna visualize it, like Sami with the camera
But there's man up on the screen that shouldn't be seen because they're bluffin'
Sick with the lyrics, the way I flip it
I fucking kill it, give me the figures
I want it, trust me to get it finished
Aitch is the illest, you dig it
You know I rip it, init
This gal got ---
I lick it, I movin' sickly with it
I took my shades off, she fucked all her mates off
She was acting shy until the jeans, dem came off
Enough about gyal, you still see me with the same squad
From Jay plug to A1, it's my time, game on
Part 2

You see me, I'm tryna get rich before I turn twenty
Two years left to keep the P steady
But you know what the white boy's like
I'll spend it tonight and be coming home messy
Get me? Nah you don't, you're not ready
They ask if you rate me, you just say "semi"
Standard, bring like 10 of your favourite MCs
Trust me don, I'll spin any
Come then, who spits first?
Get a penny and flip it
Rip it to fuck, man's going on livid
Please quit it, know your limits
You're outside 'cause you can't get a ticket
I'm backstage with the girl
But I'm driving tonight so I just got a WKD
Might go pay my girl a quick visit
Hang on a minute, I don't have one, bin it
Yo, tell me the truth, who's testing?
A-I-T-C-H, I'm the best 'cause I say I am
I'm putting in work everyday
I plan to accomplish, dun know, I got this
Fuck up and popped it, ugh
So gwarn then, hate, I don't give two fucks
R kid, you can tell man later fam
Your gyal told me she got cake for man
You're not big, you're a little bit sick
But you're still not levs', not touching the kid
You're out here doing 24 shifts, I'm ripping the 'riddim
And linking a bitch
I don't spit about guns and shit
You're all boring me, I have fun with this
Beat gets sore 'cause I stump this quick
Blast the mic off stage with a kung-fu kick
Check

Check, watch how I come through slick
Before I spit tell the mic I'm gonna bun you quick
Grime is a bitch and I love that chick
I said grime is a bitch and I love that chick
(Keep that one running Kenny, keep that one running
We're going one more time you know)
Yo, I just creep on beats like an evil beast
Go calm with the flow, I'm deceiving G
Got a gyal to my left and she's feeling me
But I told her 'I don't catch feelings B
True say I'm above these guys
You can find me where the ceiling be
'Cause recently I been eating beats so frequently
One day I hope Maddie will jump in the Addison Lee with me
Swerve that, she can jump in the passy
Like a trampoline, how I jump on a batty
Not taking the run, man jump in a cabby
True say I'm moving all scatty
But that's what you get when you F with a boy from Manny
About Loub's, step in the trackie
Excellent flow, still doing it classy
I'm tryna blow you know, and trust in a couple of years
If you're doubtin' me now, I be saying "I told you so"
They all think that I've got a big head, that's dead
See me, I'm not known to boast
But soon come, I be on a boat with loads of hoes
 in a cup, blowin' loads of smoke
Woah, fill up my cup in the shubz
Show nothing but love
It's all good, Aitch still fucking it up
Them man not fucking with us, trust
My time, it's my type of shine
Slide through with the guys on positive vibes
Send for me, get the shock of your life
'Cause I'll show man about mocking a guy
I just take the piss with the bop and a slide, uh
It gets hot when I'm dropping a rhyme
If you say that I've got it on lock, then you're right
And if you heard I ain't the guy, that's a lie
Not ain't rich yet, but I still get by
And I won't get spun 'cause no one will try
