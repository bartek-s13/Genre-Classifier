Was good man ?
This Shay
Just got up top
Just got this package from the homie blizz
And he talking about
Sorry Nigga I'm Tryna Come Home (S.N.I.T.C.H.)
Listen this what I want you to do
I want you &amp; the homies throw him a welcome home party ya dig?

Tats all on ya arm
Rags all on our head
They say kill of your enemies
So why all my brothers dead?
Flyer all these colors
Blue, yellow, and red
U get caught in the wrong hood and all u hear is that led

4x It go bang bang, shoot em up,shoot em bang bang

Staring down a barrel
All I could think about is my mother
Disappointing my pops, never telling wifey that I loved her
Ain't built for these street
I'm tryna be just like my brother
Ain't going out like no sucka
I pray that BLOOD got me covered
(Oh LORD )
Lord please forgive me
If i hit them
Or if one of them ever hit me
It's  Life after death
I been listening to biggie
Should of been bumping Kirk
But I wanted them franklyns and them fifties
And a girl fancy with a iggy
Tryna puff like I was diddy
Just a badboy in the city
See was all bout them benjis
My circle come to your block
Dont be scared
We spraying them semi's
Til they empty
R.I.P to the homies
We numb the pain with this henny
Pouring out that O.E
All wanna be O.G
And that's Bobby Johnson
From the New York
To Philly
All the way to Compton
My O.G
Is J.C
So we really banging
One Blood
No Junior Reid
Salvation Army
We affiliated
It's the eye!

Tats all on ya arm
Rags all on our head
They say kill of your enemies
So why all my brothers dead?
Flyer all these colors
Blue, yellow, and red
U get caught in the wrong hood and all u hear is that led

BANG BANG
I'm from the block of the hollow shots
BANG BANG
My old block they would never call cops
BANG BANG
To be honest I ain't never see a mask
BANG BANG
We knew the killaz they gave us a pass
It's real out there in the ghetto
I'm mean it's absolutely special
I'm mean they into fendi
&amp; Gooey Luey
Ain't no tic toc on the bezel
Un Uh
Ryding on the wave
High with metal
Can't choose God they side with devil
Pray for the cash
Then go kill for it
Rap about it
Then go try to get a deal for it
Police gone see you on a billboard
Know you gone get pop or locked but you still do it
It's all about choices
Know a killa cuz he hear a lot voices
And a killa always think he can't trust you
Cuz he can't trust himself and it's annoying
Man!
Must be hard being lied to
Got enemy living inside you
But I just wanna go &amp; just remind you
That GOD know exactly where to find you
And HE can forgive all of the time too
Even the dumb,def and blind too
What's the definition of apostle?
The one that will go and give the gospel
I said what's the definition of apostle?
The one that will go and give the gospel
Tats all on ya arm
Rags all on our head
They say kill of your enemies
So why all my brothers dead?
Flyer all these colors
Blue, yellow, and red
U get caught in the wrong hood and all u hear is that led

Let me know what's up
I'll be in touch
