<<<<<<< HEAD
I'm never selfish, piss take I'm thinking 'bout we
Since I got locks in, they dread the wave that I bring
See, see, see, see
I've got faith in you, baby we can be B.I.G
Doin' up baby boy, but I never sleep in my crib
Big puff for sure wi'me whenever we walk in
So I love to see you leave, see you leave
From the back came back with a bang
I just came from Dam
I'm the man even as a boy, I'm like Peter Pan
Ku Klux Klan, I don't fuck with niggas
Like who bought my man
Trumpet boys they're full of jazz

Oh my, my queen ain't no trophy broski - she a gold mine
I put lean inside my sprite and it make me shut both eyes
This ain't half time, how you playin' both sides?
Both sides, oh my
She thought you went in until I pulled up outside
Pussy so good I can't pull up tryna hit on her spine
Both sides, how you playin' both sides?

One hour thirty I kick it out cos she was regular
Balls deep when I rise up, you ain't man enough
Been hard in the booth, I was due to bust
My friends told me that I think too much
But you say that I don't think enough
I hit her gardens I leave her with carrots, the veggies, the whole lot
Won't stop
Man's got his foot on the pedal and I got money on the TomTom
Lemme switch it cos you guessed it
White girl for me 'less she racist, pulling all up on my necklace
Pulling all up on my chains, girl don't hide, you feel a way
Only like when I lay, when I hit it Kelly bae it rains
Oh my, my queen ain't no trophy broski - she a gold mine
I put lean inside my sprite and it make me shut both eyes
This ain't half time, how you playin' both sides?
Both sides, oh my
She thought you went in until I pulled up outside
Pussy so good I can't pull up tryna hit on her spine
Both sides, how you playin' both sides?
