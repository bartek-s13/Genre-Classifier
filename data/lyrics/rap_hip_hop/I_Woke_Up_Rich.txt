Chorus
I bought a brick today
I sold A brick
I got my money today
I'm countin my money today
I'm feelin rich today
I'm takin yo bitch today
Met her yesterday
Fuckin yo bitch today
Pre verse
I woke up rich, I woke up rich, I woke up rich
I woke up rich , I woke up rich, I woke up rich
Verse 1
Only had one G in my jeans
Now I spend one G on my jeans
Double G all on my jeans
F.O.G and Gucci jeans
I use to be broke , I use to be broke
No job will hire me
If they did they will always fire me
Back to the street, back to the street
Cocaine will hire me
Be my own boss i will never fire me
See I took all the risk
Reward myself with a water wrist
Scrap, scrap, scrap, Splash, splash, splash
Yeah thats a water a water risk
Look at me be like me
Drugs payed for all of this
A 9 to 5 no 9 to 5
Will never pay for all of this
