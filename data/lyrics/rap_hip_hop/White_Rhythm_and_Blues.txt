<<<<<<< HEAD
I don't want you to hold me tight
Till you're mine to hold
And I don't even want you to stay all night
Just until the moon turns cold
All I need is black roses, white rhythm and blues
And somebody who cares when you lose
Black roses, white rhythm and blues
You say that somebody really loves you
You'd find her if you just knew how
But honey, everyone in the whole wide world
Is probably asleep by now
And they're dreaming of black roses, white rhythm and blues
And somebody who cares when you lose
Black roses, white rhythm and blues
Close your eyes, sleep away all your blues
I've done everything but lie
Now I don't know what else I can do
Ah, the night time sighs and I hear myself
But the words just stick in my throat
Would you think that somebody like me
Might hurt much more than it shows
Just send me black roses, white rhythm and blues
And somebody who cares when you lose
Black roses, white rhythm and blues
Black roses, white rhythm and blues
Black roses, white rhythm and blues
