<<<<<<< HEAD
We in the club and they know that we out here whippin'
Lil’ girlfriends get to trippin
Dugged out we ain't even started pitchin'
I ain’t hit that yet but i'm itchin'
I don't wanna go back like it's yayo
I don't wanna touch bread if it's bad like it's day old
I don’t wanna know your ass for nay hoe
I just wanna mac bae like Vallejo
I don’t ever miss the base though
Outchea on a red eye
Won't even feel the glove move
Cause I slide like a jedi
Swing away, swing away, swing away, swing away
Do not think for a minute I ain’t goin for the pennant
Yeah certified authentic, any old way I get it
Bout 400 i'll hit it, swing away, swing away
Wound up now I finish, your ass out like venice
Bitch I only Finesse, keep that bench warm just like Hennessy
You no play, you no play, shit we on first base
Know you can't slide in the first place
Never seen a play in the worst way
Now you gotta kick it every birthday
Don't be cruel don’t curve me
Backwoods all on my jersey
Always out the park like a derby
Bitches suckin' up like a kirby
I don't ever miss the base though
Outchea on a red eye
Won't even feel the glove move
Cause I slide like a jedi
Swing away, swing away, swing away, swing away
Get straight to the dougout
Roll a bat up then we thugout
Full flex in the clubhouse
Left it on the field then we cutout
Pitch it up then we shutout
Imma pull the goddamn plug out
Popped off then we sailout
Stack bond for the bailout
We in the club and they know that we out here whippin'
Lil' girlfriends get to trippin
Dugged out we ain't even started pitchin'
I ain't hit that yet but i'm itchin'
I don't wanna go back like it's yayo
I don't wanna touch bread if it's bad like it's day old
I don't wanna know your ass for nay hoe
I just wanna mac bae like Vallejo
I don't ever miss the base though
Outchea on a red eye
Won't even feel the glove move
Cause I slide like a jedi
