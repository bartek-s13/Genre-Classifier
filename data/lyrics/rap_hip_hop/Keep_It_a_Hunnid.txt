Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, Soldier
Soldier, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah

Just keep it a hundred with me (A hundred)
If you fuck with the kid, let me know what it is
I was fucked up, I was down on my dick
I didn't ask for no hand, got this shit how I live
Just keep it a hundred with me (For real)
When the pressure build up, nigga, is you gon' fold?
Damn, that's a trip, I didn't think that would happen
These bitches so fake, they can't stick to the code

I was fucked up when my shawty was with me
I thought she was real but it turned out a lie
Thought she was it but that's just what I get
Gave my heart to a bitch, now the bitch gotta die
I tried to stay cool but I couldn't
And the pain cut me deep like a motherfuckin' bullet
Gave her my heart but she play with my shit
And I didn't give a fuck so the lil' ho just took it
Shit fuckin' with me for real
'Cause the streets do me dirty, I'm watchin' for 12
Fightin' some cases, my head on a swivel
They wanna indict me and send me to Hell
Until that day, bitch, I'm trappin'
Bitch, that's just what it is and I'm labeled a savage
Mama down bad and my grandma still workin'
I need all the profit, 'cause bitch, we didn't have it
They labeled your boy as the bad guy
But this shit that I do, it all come with a purpose
Niggas get mad 'cause they want my position
They hate my success and they label me worthless
My life tryna come back together
I'm not trustin' nobody, that's just what it is
Everything fake, everybody a snake
So I'm watchin' the people that claim that they real
Just keep it a hundred with me (A hundred)
If you fuck with the kid, let me know what it is
I was fucked up, I was down on my dick
I didn't ask for no hand, got this shit how I live
Just keep it a hundred with me (For real)

Damn, that's a trip, I didn't think that would happen
These bitches so fake, they can't stick to the code

I didn't think she would change but she did
And she blame it on me like a motherfuckin' kid
Married to money, can't care 'bout a bitch
And that's just how I feel and that's just what it is
She want me to love her, I can't though
I'm back in my feelings, lil' baby, the bank closed
Can't put my all into a bitch 'cause I ran out of trust
Baby girl, and I hate hoes
The hate motivate me
Big bro in the trap sellin' dope like the 80's
Prepare for the costs that would come with a boss
Man, I'm tellin' you now, ain't nobody gon' play me
Niggas ungrateful, that's crazy
I came a long way but these niggas impatient
Niggas get mad 'cause I'm up at the top
And they stuck at the bottom and tryna debase me
Niggas like, "Soldier, please save me"
When I was fucked up, I didn't know who to call
Now that I'm up, I just can't give a fuck
And y'all had me fucked up so you know I'ma ball
Stand on my money, it's tall
I'm stuck at the top, ain't no way I can fall
Keep it a hundred or stay out my way
'Cause I'm steppin' on niggas, these niggas so small, for real
Just keep it a hundred with me (A hundred)
If you fuck with the kid, let me know what it is
I was fucked up, I was down on my dick
I didn't ask for no hand, got this shit how I live
Just keep it a hundred with me (For real)
