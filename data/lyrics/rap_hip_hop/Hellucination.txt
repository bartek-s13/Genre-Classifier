Sitting on the toilet, shitting, puffing the dough
Strobe light effect, everything's moving slow
Slip into a deep zone, the sound of the phone bring me home
Stagger to my feet and motion toward the phone

A-yo Ripper what up nigga, check out this proposition
There's money to bait and I'm in the mood to go fishing

Whatever nigga, give me time to wash my ass
My hand been itching all day, fiending for the cash

Do what you gotta do cos I'm on my way in the car
Cos when I get there yo we audi like tomorrow
(Right right easy)
Now I'm off to the south, to get more info on this dough I heard about
Gotta make sure everything's secure
Can't let me and my man let these Grants slip past our hands
The man's out heavy today
I hope they don't try to get in the way of our pay

Damn, already high noon, the man's out
Gotta take a quick shower, get dressed and bounce
Grabbed the fatigues, strapped on the generals
Proper attire for all criminals
Blazed up the clip, load up the four-fifth
If a bwoy riff, leave a body dem stiff
Who dem man there gwan rap pon my door?
Disturb me at work, on the low dub four
A-yo it's me
(Who that?)
S-T what up, G?
(Aight hold up son, let me put it back on safety)
A-yo kid it smells like fresh grown cess
Let's twist up some trees 'fore we jet

True, you know we keep a fat sack of sensi
Even though you know it make our pockets go empty

Well all that's about to be solved in a few minutes
So whenever we finish we gon' bag up this spinach

Easier said than done, peep the 4-1-1
The dread around the corner just tried to blast Ruck and dun

I knew it, bad vibes flowing like fluid
Forget about the dough, let's do it
I see you already strapped, pa
So I'll meet you outside cos my gat's back in the car
How far must one go
Before I throw his whole entire life right out the window
(talking)

Him a dead bwoy and him don't even know
(Yo he looks like the dread that hooked us up on the low)
What you say, fly?
(Thinking out loud, just caught me in the zone)
(I'll tell you all about it on the way home)
Whatever, I'mma send this nigga to his essence
Fucking with the fam you know he gotta learn a lesson
And you know he ain't even yardie, right?
Some bwoy gwan get dead tonight
As we strap on the gloves, feel the buzz from the cannabis
Niggas 'bout to get scandalous
(talking and gunshots)

Gotta be gone on the double
I think I seen 'em all tumble, but on the left there's trouble
Undercover had this build staked out
Watching the whole thing go down, yo it's time to break out
The four-fifth as I shift and drive
Cos every man here might not leave alive

Son why you stalling? Hop on the ball and
Get us outta here before we be the next fallen
Right now, this whole shit is bugged, we the thugs
Yet the beast coming up showing niggas love
Took our burners, gave a dap, let us bounce
Now it's back to the dog house to smoke the next ounce
(talking)

Who could believe them beast left us alone
And took the chrome that's in one of our own back home
And not only that kid, check how money that we just did
Was that connect for the cash
Them pigs must have had dibs for the stash
Now ain't that some shit for your ass

True say I never liked his pretty ass anyway
But that shit with the pigs cold made my day
Gave me a whole new outlook on the beast
Even watch for them ones so called the beast
But anyway, you know we high right now
Doing it like this, the original crook style
