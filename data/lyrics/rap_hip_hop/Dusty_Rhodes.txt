Say it like you mean it (Uh Huh)
Say it like you mean it (Uh Huh)
Say it like you mean it (Uh Huh)
Say it like you mean it (Uh Huh, Uh Huh)
Let's go, back on them on country roads
Where I arose, Them dusty roads
Like Dusty Rhodes,  but I'm from the four
& Thats the D if you don't know

I harvest the crop
Pa planted a seed
Got a Heck of a ma
For raising this tree
Put faith in my pot, sprinkled my leaves
When I get them knots, I'm spending like three
One for the life
Two the grief
Three for being there time and again
Spending the time you didn't have to lend
I know that you love me, and I am convinced
That you sacrificed yo' dreams for me and my bro
Countless nights, abandoned sleep when daddy stepped out, hit the road
Gave us country life, that love that hugs you tight & keeps ya close
Ain't no mom like mine my mom is irreplaceable
When I got outta college
I was in the bany,stuck with my shay
Didn't really have a penny, diggy just born
Despite what doc says
Nigga still fucked up watching an all hood movie up on east broadway
Really tough luck due to drama had to stay with shay auntie
Then I had to luck up, I got on at the Feddie
All props go out to Steve really turned me to a lethal weapon
19 with a degree, then I met Jesse
Flying out my family,  2 bands every week blessing
This what i did
So I blew some cash, on a silly hat, I always walked so I got a car
Re' hit a deer within 2 weeks and we had to deal with insurance frauds
Came outta pocket to fix the rocket,awh hell then I lost my job
This some funny shit, mark sold the company a week before we went to Omaha
Back to the country oh my god!
I love that place, but I have seen better jobs
Flashing lights, expensive bars
Dispensaries and reservoirs
The city life for a country boy
Man I miss that feeling joy
Yeah, I miss that feeling joy
I ain't lying I was in my feelings cause
In the country, I wanted some change
Wanted some change I listened to Pac
I really know who down
Who want me to pop
They've seen that I have it
I'm one of a kind, I'm out of a box
Went to the orange, to switch up the plot
Fam did us dirty, wasn't helping us out
Suppose to be pops tried kicking us out
Back to the peach, twion flaming the box
Fussing, and fighting with ma meka
I'm like oh my oh Jesus
Brother sister love, Cat dog fight sequel
Swear they act just like ike and tina
So we went back to the G just for Re' to release lil squeaker
Then we move back down to the d, first 2 weeks cold as fuck no heater
6 months passed still got hope
Perfecting my craft in my studio
Flexing that pen and pad
Headphones out in work out mode
Re' found a post on facebook scroll
Said Sony distribution competition coming close
Headed to the bany pack our clothes
Just to try out for a junky show
At a little club called 2.0
Swear to god they tried a nigga like a lame
It was all pussy this pussy that, and lil bihh suck my thang (aye)
I was rapping about' some real shit, and no one felt my Pain
After that I told myself, forget about reach I'm all about aim

Cause I am from an old dusty road (for real though!)
Jxhhny blest, out the woods
Yeah I'm from the four
Bring my team with me
Know we did it on our own
Uh Yeah we from an old dusty road

Yeah I'm from
From an old dusty road
Jxhhny blest, out the woods
Yeah I'm from the four (aye!)
