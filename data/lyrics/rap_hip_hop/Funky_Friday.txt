At this age, how are them man still hating?
My young boy in a different country
But he ain't ever been on vacation
One hand on the girl I'm dating
One hand on the cash I'm making
We come through like Funky Friday
And have all of your mandem skating

I came in, 550 on trainers
Island girl amazing, could be Bajan, Trini or Haitian
She, got a bag with flowers
If the trainers match I'll take it
Me and bro just shut down Gucci
Had the whole of the shop floor waitin'
Who's that girl in the line
With the big behind that's looking all tempting?
If, her friend is a dead ting
Take one for the team with a bredrin
Two, peng tings at the entrance
Want attention but a man can't let them
She, must think I'm a reverend
You ain't comin' here getting redemption, no way

We come through like Funky Friday
And have all of your mandem skating

I see dem man skatin' now, I'm talking about running their legs
My youngens in country plugging the Z
He can't even buck me till nothing is left
I flooded my right, I flooded my left
I'm ducking your wife, I'm ducking the feds
The bell on the trap, it's buzzin' again
But still I ain't trying to get busted by feds
Look, man, I ain't caught the bus in a sec'
It's me and my rambo cuttin' through West
The way that I went and just flooded my neck
I'm shocked that I ain't gotta struggle for breath
With me and the missus be going on dates
She's holding the dipper, I'm holding her waist
Just see some pigs moving low in the mains
So I phone up my nigga and told him the plate

Tell a peng girl you can HMU
I don't wanna cuddle and H-U-G
And I'm still shopping in HMV
For all of my niggas in HMP
Heard you got a girl going DMU
If I DM'd you would she DM me?
Young black brudda I'm a stylish g
Man I put the IC in IC3

They tell me I'm gifted in rap
Nothing was nice, used to live in the trap
Now if I go ask that chick for her snap
I can bet money she's giving me that
I'm always in Harrods, I'm filling the bag
Them niggas ain't winners, them niggas are mad
Gyal at my vids and them bitches are bad
They get picked in the foreigns and ditched in the cab
