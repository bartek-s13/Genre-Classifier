Yeah
It takes balls to chase your dreams
Gravitas
All the neysayers they see what you do you know
I’m in ATL, I’m in Texas, I’m in New York
All the time

I love Pittsburgh this city’s my home
But I gotta see the world, gotta see Rome
Private flight flown leave at night arrive morn
Bought a one way ticket don’t know when I comin’ home
Not lookin’ back like I had to jump bond
Had to sell a few shares ditch a few junk bonds
No phones calls turned all my cells off
I’m enjoyin’ this shit, cause I work my ass off
Passport Dreams helped a yacht cast off
Toss a glance lady salivate keep the Pavlov
Change my currency I’m currently amazed
At the current state a euros, they might be leavin’ Greece
Never no grease, olive oil wit the fish
A few clams is a must we don’t rush when we sit
Mush to the lust, concierge buzz us in
Let’s sin, let’s sin
California dreamin’, sail the Caribbean
Keep a hideaway faraway when I wanna change seasons
Won’t even need a reason
Only time I feel snow, when I go skiin’
California dreamin’, sail the Caribbean
Keep a hideaway faraway when I wanna change seasons
Won’t even need a reason
Everywhere I go, ladies know, I’m leavin’

Fall’s my favorite season it’s somethin’ about the foli
Bet I bless a fresh hoodie keep my wardrobe holy
Live wit no regrets, cause an old head told me
Please don’t be too quick to judge, if you really don’t know me
Facade so phony ya facade so phony
Can't be my tenderoni still you get the pepperoni
Cause you been a good girl these other girls more phony
The very same old head told me Ray -
Never put pescado where you keep the guacamole
When you hittin’ shots all day baby what is a goalie
Yeah I’m sittin’ on my team’s shoulders feelin’ like Kobe
After press conferences I’m somewhere smoky
In between locales I’m chillin’ out low key
Overseas ocean breeze so relieved smokin’ trees
Please believe homie I converse wit dames
That’ll make ya babe look homely, pick up ya face homie
