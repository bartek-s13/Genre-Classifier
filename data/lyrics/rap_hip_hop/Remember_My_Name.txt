I'm out of this world, Jupiter Venus
Like an alien (hey), Jupiter Venus (shit)
I need an estate, creek by the lake (yeah)
I need an estate or a creek by the lake, tropical view in the scenic
Verse 1:
Shit
I was in Vegas in Vegas in Vegas all up in the Caesars (shit)
I got the sauce like Tomato, this cheese put all over the pizza (shit)
I took your bitch and then gave her back to you cause I didn't need her (shit)
I might just travel to Africa, hop on a jet to Ibiza
Spain shit, in the foreign I'mma lane switch
Never been the same, shit, I'm the hottest in the game, shit
Most of you niggas ain't saying shit
Most of you niggas ain't saying none
Most of you niggas gon' change up

Shit
Chorus:
Hold up, hold up, wait, shit
I told em remember the name (shit, uh)

100%, my percentage got accurate aim (yeah, uh)
Sega Genesis/Nintendo I'm back in the game (yeah, uh)
Verse 2:
Sega Genesis/Nintendo I'm back on the premises
I could put you on game but I know that it's something you'll never get
I took your bitch, I admit it as soon as I seen her
I picked her right off of Peter St. next to the meter
Put her in my 4 seater, 4 seater Jeep
Tending to my lil freak, she my lil' freak
Too G, Coogi, I'll be riding round 2 deep
G2, no G, nigga I ride too neat
Now she call me Ale-ale-ale-alejandro
Now I got her dripping dripping, shorty need a pancho
If she on good behaviour, bring her to Toronto
I'm the sauce man, saucing, dripping like Cilantro
Two guns up, Rambo

Now she calling me Fernando
Plug talk, plug moving chicken like Nandos
Chorus:
Hold up, hold up, wait, shit
I told em remember the name (shit, uh)
I'm hotter than fire, I'm first degree, let it flame (shit, uh)
100%, my percentage got accurate aim (yeah, uh)

Hold up, hold up, wait, shit
