Part 1

Tryna' reach them stars, reach them galaxies
Told her "Come along", ain't no fantasy
You can live your dreams with me
We riding, they watch the mileage
Speeding like I get you high
Get you oh so high
Ain't no coming down
When I roll one, we smoke a whole one
Me and shawty hit the zone and she got no clothes on
Waking up early hitting that O zone, been getting them O's gone
They wanna bring me down, I won't come down
I won't come down, I won't stop, no no
No more taking flights, I've been up late for nights, just tryna make it right
These papers lie, Satan in disguise, but still I be chasing mine
Music's like my saviour, I was lost and doin' some major crime
Them police was raiding mines and hunting my niggers for blazing nines
I roll another one then smoke another one
'Cause I been in these streets man, for way too long
Yeah, I've been out here on the road, now the music is the plug
And I'ma sell this shit to the whole fucking world, yeah
I've been up on that grind, yeah
Put that on my life, yeah
They callin' up my line, yeah
But I swear I ain't got time, yeah
From the show to the studio, these groupie hoes wanna slide, yeah
Three cities in one night, yeah
I've got different weeds in my high, yeah
Been about that life, yeah
Coming up from them drive-by's, man leaning out that ride, yeah
All my niggers doing time, yeah
Lost a couple my niggers
Word to my niggers, I'm gonna shine, yeah
Stepping off in ice, yeah
It's about to be that time, yeah
Zoning out, what's she talking 'bout?
Waking up pebbling, hitting that west side
That's where I order loud, roll up and smoke it down
She smoking too, roll up and smoke a zoot
We go out whipping in a foreign coupe, like she wanted to
I told her I'm hitting that O zone, now they tryna come along
She fuckin' with the kid, she can't wait to get alone
I grew up on the strip, I'm tryna get the money for the O's
Give a fuck about your clique, nigga I came up with my woes, yeah
Like with my woes, in that whip I want
With that bitch I want and she know when we hit that road, we gon' hit that zone
With my woes
Yeah, I pull up with my woes, yeah
Like with my woes, in that whip I want
With that bitch I want and she know when we hit the zone
I'ma hit that zone with my woes
I pull up with my woes, yeah
Part 2

It's more than music, homie
The streets won't do it for me
How many times I gotta roll out with this Luger on me?
Police all around me, I'm still para with this food up on me
I don't want your ratings, I'm just stating what the truth is homie
Lost my best friend to these streets, shit was hard for me
Feeling like everything around me fell apart homie
Still I'm tryna find a way, see, I don't know where to start homie
Coming up out that dark, homie, you can see them scars on me
Pushing all my chips and I swear that I go all out
Drama with these bitches, making couple niggers fall out
Wonder where my God's at, does he hear me when I call out?
Them prayers ain't getting answered, got me thinking what it's for now
They're plotting on me, preeing on me, them niggas scheme
I've been out rapping, been out trapping, still wit' the team
And Charlie, this ain't feeling real, I mean it's been a dream
But still I'm out here tryna stretch this yay far like a limousine
So fuck what you heard, I've been out trapping on the curbs
Tryna make it work, still turning nina's into birds
It's like you do what you got to do to make it what it's worth
Without the risk there's no reward so I'm still ready for the worst
Fuck the lyrics on my iPhone, I lost at one of my shows
My lifeline's on my line phone and paigons hope I die slow, yeah
Wherever I go, they clock me like the timezone
Shout Skepta running grime, and I'm still king here in my zone
Who said we wouldn't make it off the streets and off the corner
Smoking marijuana and now I'm feeling like a sauna
I remember my mum would warn us 'bout 'em spliffs whenever she caught us
"One day you'll be addicted", shit, now look at me with this quarter
Ain't got time for a part time, I'm working on a anthem
Or running around with the mandem, ain't nobody understand 'em
Peng ting in my bed at night, she way above the average
Plus she know just where my head's at, without putting up in that
She said, "You'll make it for your people", but damn these streets are evil
These road are so deceitful, had me moving like I lost it
That burner in my pocket, in their ends like fuck the gossip
My finger on the trigger, yeah, it's too deep for me to drop it
Most these niggas never done shit, this beef is just a cycle
The realest, they inside, without their life, they with the lifers
Man, I never seen it coming, yeah
Looking at what my people come from, Luton, this ain't fucking London
I've been on my grind so long, I swear my head hurts
Putting in that legwork everyday until that ped word
All the mandem raving, I'm like "Damn, I want that bread first"
Building my connections like that signal on my network
I want neckwork for the music, they ask me what I'm doing
Smoking too much weed and putting P's into this nuisance
Man, there ain't no shortcuts, I do this shit properly
Fuckin' up these shows so you can holla if you want me
See, I started from the bottom, but the team, they with my brudda
On the road all through the winter, I had no sense with just some youngers
Searching for that money, moving up without a compass
They say "Save up them pennies if you tryna reach them hundreds"
So we did just what they told us, we're not lacking for the paper
Just breakouts for them haters, serving comments like they waiters
Attempts to slow me down, and them attempts are getting baiter
I just wanna be rich, I want it sooner rather than later
I get it on, I had to switch lanes
Ain't slowing from them disc brakes
Go wherever it takes just to make it out this shit place
And I don't even rap no more, I'm makin' music
I'm pulling up with some shooters, got promoters moving stupid
All the people round me ruthless, where do you think I got this eye from?
A nice guy, still a wise guy, whenever I'm on
Them police and sirens got me running for my life, don
I'm spending all this time on, just tryna make that right song
My views, I'm getting over that
You hear my views, I'm getting older akh
Someone should really try and hold me back
I'm headin' out of town just for the week but I'll be back soon
Starin' in my face, they're probably thinking, "he's that rap goon"
I'm trapping, I'm trapping, 'cause I don't know what else to do
And it gets harder when nobody's tryna help you
Fed up of the system and that shit we born up into
I know you'll understand if you've been through what I've been through, yeah
