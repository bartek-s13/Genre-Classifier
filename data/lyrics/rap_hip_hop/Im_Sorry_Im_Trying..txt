I'm sorry that I can't get out of bed
I'm sorry that my head's always a mess
I'm sorry that I missed your call
For the third time in a row
I promise that I care much more than I show

Don't get carried away, no
I'll only let you down
Certain circumstances got me feeling low
Don't take it personally
Talk some sense into me, I’ve been feeling senseless
Acting selfish, hate myself so fucking much, I’m out of touch
But I can see through all the lies that they’ve been selling me
Quit telling me you know they know what's best for me
My patience being tested, see
In the parking lot of the high school that I went to
Thought I hated it, but it's real shit when your friends leave
And you're back home with the same dreams
On the same street
All of the things that I’ve taken for granted is now
Everything that I wish hadn’t ended
All that I hated is now what I miss
Ain't that a bitch
I'm sorry that I can't get out of bed
I'm sorry that my head's always a mess
I'm sorry that I missed your call
For the third time in a row
I promise that I care much more than I show
