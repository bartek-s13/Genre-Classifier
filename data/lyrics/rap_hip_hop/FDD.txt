Daytrip took it to 10 (Hey)
Ayy

Take my hand, hold on
The drugs, they take me to another zone
Fuck the drugs, baby, just come on home
Fuck the drugs, baby, just come on home
Take my hand (Take my hand), hold on (Hold on)
The drugs, they take me to another zone ('Nother zone)
Fuck the drugs, baby, just come on home (Come on home)
Fuck the drugs, baby, just come on home (Come on home)

Fuck the drugs, fuck the drugs, girl they fuck you up (Fuck you up)
You can't see, hear nothing, no, when you stuck (When you stuck)
That shit don't hit, it's for the moment (Just for the moment)
That shit don't hit, it's for the moment (It's just for the moment)
You'll never wanna feel this way again
The pain, it never stops, for real, so stop before you win (Stop before you win)
You fuck around, you're losin' all your friends
Just don't lose your mind

She say she ain't wanna hear it
Only listen to her demons, so she never get it
Used to be so easy with her, but she actin' different
All these drugs up in her system make 'em lose spirit

Take my hand, hold on
The drugs, they take me to another zone
Fuck the drugs, baby, just come on home
Fuck the drugs, baby, just come on home
Take my hand (Take my hand), hold on (Hold on)
The drugs, they take me to another zone ('Nother zone)
Fuck the drugs, baby, just come on home (Come on home)
Fuck the drugs, baby, just come on home (Come on home)

Why'd you let her do it? (Do it)
Now she gone, you stuck and feelin' so stupid
Never realize what you have until you lose it ('Til you lose it)
Never realize what you have until you lose it (Whoa)
Fake love, fake love, fake love (Fake love)
When they gone, the only time you care enough (Care enough)
Why won't she wake up? (Wake up)
Fuck, you really messed up

She say she ain't wanna hear it
Only listen to her demons, so she never get it
Used to be so easy with her, but she actin' different
All these drugs up in her system make 'em lose spirit

Take my hand, hold on
The drugs, they take me to another zone
Fuck the drugs, baby, just come on home
Fuck the drugs, baby, just come on home
Take my hand (Take my hand), hold on (Hold on)
