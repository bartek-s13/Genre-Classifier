I don't feel no pressure
Yeah pressure bust pipes and the pole on my dresser
Rumors get started, you start getting blessed up
Breaking the work down, and smoking the extra
Bring 'em to school and I talk 'bout the work
I feel like a professor
Bringing to you but I don't got no vessel
Dreaming of Teslas
We getting fed up, my niggas aggresive
Everyone slanging but my side the Mecca
I'm bringing it back if the pack look defective
Niggas get jacked when they lack with they necklace
And that's what I question, I'm smoking the best shit
Still 'bout progression for me and my section
Where we like the church when we come for collection
Niggas be talking, there's nothing to check 'em
But let it get reckless, those sticks get the Wesson
Watch who you screwing, look out for possessions
Cause when you maneuver, they plotting to get you
Niggas got Nerf guns, they big and they wet you
Gotta move smarter, don't let 'em perplex you
Bro bought a Prezi, cash, off of the record
Commander-in-Chief, but ain't no election
Whole lot of kief inside of my section
The money important, I made my selection

And no bond is stronger than me and my money
Ain't no bond stronger than me and my money
No bond is stronger than me and money
Ain't no bond stronger than me and my money
No bond is stronger than me and my money
Ain't no bond stronger than me and my money
Ain't no bond stronger than me and my money
That's just how I like it
That's just how I want it
Ain't no bond stronger than me and the money
Ain't no bond stronger than me and the money
Ain't no bond stronger than me and my money
Ain't no bond stronger than me and my money
Ain't no bond stronger than me and my money
Ain't no bond stronger than me and my money
Ain't no bond stronger than me and my money
No bond is stronger than me and my money

Ain't that shit funny
I would hit you up, you won't hit me back
Now look at you, you calling my jack
Now that I blew, what happened to that?
Need some new shoes, go get a new pack
Gotta break rules to get on the map
Thinking of views, my bitch Jimmy Choos
All mad cause I would, I'm making it happen
Everything fire, like Spyro the dragon
Ain't from this side? Then I'm bagging and taxing
Focus on rapping and less on the fashion
I'm up on my passion and getting it brackin'
Yeah, I would get high as Alladin
Yeah, then close my eyes and imagine
My name ring bells from France all through Manhattan
Your pockets lacking, ain't no use in bragging

And no bond is stronger than me and my money
Ain't no bond stronger than me and my money
No bond is stronger than me and money
Ain't no bond stronger than me and my money
No bond is stronger than me and my money
Ain't no bond stronger than me and my money
Ain't no bond stronger than me and my money
That's just how I like it
That's just how I want it
Ain't no bond stronger than me and the money
Ain't no bond stronger than me and the money
Ain't no bond stronger than me and my money
Ain't no bond stronger than me and my money
Ain't no bond stronger than me and my money
Ain't no bond stronger than me and my money
Ain't no bond stronger than me and my money
No bond is stronger than me and my money
