Verse 1
Out of breath, out of breath
Doused with sweat when I pound my chest
And I prowl possessed with a malcontent to be counted yet…Not yet?
God damn…Huh
If you're counting reps, it’s a set of a thousand bounded reps
That are bounded with my callousness, now crown me next
These motherfuckers wanna seize my set, wanna see me rest, wanna feed me less
Est. my peak and the Ouija says reap my seed, me regress?
No! Damn…
And I'm all en route with a G.P.S., no Cali drought that I've seen
On the scenes of a T.V. set, flows keep me wet
Overrated bars in their overrated cars, tarot card telling me to tear ‘em all apart
And I’m over the rating that's making them stars, I'm sober and shaking and tracing my scars
My poker face fading I'm faking it hard, bitches are basic and wasting this art
Your vision needs a Lasik when I hit you with the cadence, and the venom of the vapor when I spit this bar
Sacrificial pawn and I bet you wanna spar, and I bet you wanna battle, pack a pistol in your palm
Catapulting bullets that I'm pulling from the psalms, quoted for effect when I focus on the font
Focus on the wrongs, I'm a lotus in the dark, like I'm sulfur in a match when I flash with a spark
Tactical with ten laps to go and I'm planning for the famine that I fathom when I starve
Chorus:
(Just Breathe)
Deep Breath, Deep Breath, Deep Breath
Looking for the reset, heat check
Never slow to speak but don’t overheat
(Just Breathe)
Half court, Hands on my knees
I’m a quarter in with a quarter tank
I can't afford to bank on E
(Just Breathe)
Deep Breath, Deep Breath, Deep Breath
I just wanna be next, me next
Looking for the peak next, please yes
(Just Breathe)
Fuck, and I’m falling short of my dreams
Gonna need some oxygen if I'm honest
Cough until my coffin calls upon me
(Just Breathe)
Verse 2
It's no hesitation, it's a meditation
So I can measure weight with every breath I’m taking
‘Bout to come undone with a ventilation of a lung that's pumped with a dedication
To an unsung sum of a separation
Of me and you, you and me, no kumbaya with the group I see
It's a coup de tat with a tsunami, with a, “boom aya, aya Ali,”
With a plume of smoke from an isotope, isolated when I'm making violent quotes
Violated taking all the time to note, that I'm, never gonna make it on to final vote
Going loco in four door riding through SODO, screaming, “YOLO, I'm in love with the coco,”
Oh no, really though, that's what'll pass, to the pack that I pass as a rap pro?
I've gotta go bro, don't need a GoPro to follow me
I'm a proponent of a promotion that'll call bullshit no apologies
Don't call on me, I won't stand up, barely got a buck for the gas can, Ah!
Apparently I've gotta pause fasten up but be wary of the cause of the catalyst, Ah!
I don't think you really want it bad enough, I'll fucking put it to you till your backing up
Throw another tantrum on a stanza while I ban ya for a lack of stamina
Chorus
Verse 3
I don't have to win
But I fucking hate to lose and I'm sucking 02 just to move
I don't have to win
But I fucking hate to lose, I amuse myself and improve myself
With a muse and rules I choose myself, I assume my use of the moves I've dealt
With approval proof from who? Myself, will improve my use of pseudo-self
‘Bout to elope with my ego, when I relocate I repo
See notes that I keep close, when I speak my speech is keynote
Looking at the notes that I made for the speech, pushing for the quotes that I came to teach
Like opposing Popes that are pulling prose from a Holy Ghost I came to preach
It's game for free, it's like a vocab track meet on this trap beat
Oh so sad, run a full last lap with a bad back, bad feet, catch me
Cause I can't breathe, no I can't breathe
Sad romance, so last week, so it's solo Sam so savvy
All these little bitches wanna catch me
But there's no damn chance whether broke or stranded
Cash in hand or a homeless bandit, home abandoned
Can't imagine these motherfuckers ever pull advantage
