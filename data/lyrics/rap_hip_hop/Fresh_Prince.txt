I'm the fucking Fresh Prince
Think my name is Ill Smith
I got hoes from everywhere
That's just how the kid live
I'm a fucking top player
We just fuck 'cause I won't date her
Top shelf weed flavors
You Carlton with all that hatin'

And I'm the fucking fresh prince
I'mma tell you like this
Just one look is all it's taking
That's enough to steal your bitch
Ay, hit my tree, man
I need all this weed again
Blowin' blunts of Pakistan
Put me to sleep, I ain't on xans
I got the world in my hands
Shut my town down on Instagram
I got one dark and light skin
Bitch, I call em Hillary, Ashley actually
They give my dick a rinse

I'm the fucking fresh prince
Think my name is Ill Smith
I got hoes from everywhere
That's just how the kid live
I'm a fucking top player
We just fuck 'cause I won't date her
Top shelf weed flavors
You Carlton with all that hatin'

And I'm the fucking fresh prince
All my dogs pits
No, I don't miss
But we throwing up bricks
I'm running 'round chips
And where I'm from shit
We used to drop clips
Thank god I drop hits
My shit going up
Shoutout to the money from the drugs
You had no idea how real it was
I know I'm hot, I could build you up
So label signing ain't a deal for us
Remember back when we were taking trips
In and out the city for a flip
If you flex, my cousin take ya shit
He bringin' gloves in case they case for prints
If she hot then Imma take her lips
I roll her up couple blunts, that's it
She want me to trick, I ain't a S.I.M.P
Kicked her out then pour up, take a sip
Soaring higher than an angel is
Smoking fire where the danger live
My whole life is lit
How can I forget
Went from trife to rich

I'm the fucking Fresh Prince
Think my name is Ill Smith
I got hoes from everywhere
That's just how the kid live
I'm a fucking top player
We just fuck 'cause I won't date her
Top shelf weed flavors
You Carlton with all that hatin'
