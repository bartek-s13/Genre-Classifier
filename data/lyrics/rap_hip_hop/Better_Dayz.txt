<<<<<<< HEAD
Yeah, yeah
T-H-E-O
Some soul shit, yeah
Soulful, soulful

A lot of niggas pray for whips while hopin' to get their cheddar raised
Uh, I'm just prayin' for better days
They hit the block with Glocks and let berettas spray
Damn, I'm just prayin' for better days

My older cousin been dabblin' in cocaine sniffin'
Love him to death but feeling like I can't hang with him
Went to Atlanta to hopefully get some change with him
Woke up the next morning, the nigga chain missin'
Oh well, pray for his safety but hardly miss him
Shame that when I make it we can't be Bacardi sippin'
'Cause the drugs got that nigga living with a foggy vision
And I'm tryna make a living with mics like Scottie Pippen
So many friends that I'm starting to lose
Prayin' my crew don't become a party of two
Progression seem tight but like gears on a bike
Boy when you switch up that’s when it's hardest to move
'Cause niggas clown Drake for being so sentimental
Least he the same nigga over every instrumental
Niggas spittin' raps 'bout pointin' gats out tinted windows
Knowin' they ain't never owned a pistol
A lot of niggas pray for whips while hopin' to get their cheddar raised
Uh, I'm just prayin' for better days
They hit the block with Glocks and let berettas spray
Damn, I'm just prayin' for better days

My older cousin been dabblin' in cocaine sniffin'
We should be headed to new Bugatti lane switchin'
Instead he bangin' that neighborhood and gang livin'
And blow a nigga brains out if they don't bang with him
This the same nigga I ate Captain Crunch with
Neighborhood got him feeling he should pump lift
'Cause it's 60s for life, niggas never jump ship
But'll jump you when off a xan and blunt hits
It's for anybody strugglin' lookin' for better blessings
Reminisce to when I was hoopin' and droppin' dimes
Now I ain't carry TECs or no automatic weapons
But we're shootin' every day in school, it's Columbine
Damn I'm missin' responsibility, never present
As you get older, every mistake is your hardest lesson
Lost 300 dollars fuckin' with my old bitch
If I did that shit now, a nigga be homeless
So shit, it's so many women love to hate a nigga
Made 'em believe a dream 'til it drove him crazy, nigga
I'm focused on gettin' better, don't wanna go crazy with him
Like a dollar on a budget, please Lord, save a nigga
Lot of niggas pray for whips while hopin' to get their cheddar raised
Uh, I'm just prayin' for better days
They hit the block with Glocks and let berettas spray
I'm just prayin' for better days
I wish I could show my cousin a better way
Damn, I'm just prayin' for better days
Just got stabbed and might be headed to Heaven gates
Uh, I'm just prayin' for better days

Just got the text, the docs is operatin' on him
Wish I could say I was shocked to hear the news
'Cause he would often have him a couple bangers on him
And karma like movie trailers, it's always comin' soon
Pray for him, hate how he livin', but love him and never change on him
Prayin' he make it so I could create a way for him
But if he don't, I'll be prayin' on Heaven gates for him
Gotta go harder nigga
I don't need new Lamborghinis or wheel stuntin'
All I spit is real, the fans gon' feel from it
I will make it, you will know me, you will love it
So much will in these raps you think Uncle Phil love it
Competition lackin', every verse I kill something
Music like old pimples, nigga it's still bumpin'
We focused on gettin' bread, my niggas is mil huntin'
But still givin' that real, these niggas could feel from it
A lot of niggas be prayin' for whips and to get their cheddar raised
I'm just prayin' for better days
They hit the block with Glocks and let berettas spray
Uh, I'm just prayin' for better days
My older cousin' been dabblin' in cocaine sniffin'
I'm just prayin' for better days
Feeling bad that a nigga can't hang with him
Uh, I'm just prayin' for better days

Prayin' for better days
I'm just prayin' for better days
Prayin' for better days
It's still some soul shit
Still some soul shit
Feeling bad that a nigga can't hang wit' him

We all fight the same fight
It's for every nigga with a 9 to 5 that they don't fuck wit'
Every nigga with a relative
And a lifestyle that they don't fuck with it
REASON, I'm just prayin' for better days
