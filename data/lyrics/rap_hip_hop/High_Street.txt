Brighton town where you find me, I'm on the high street
I got the best flow, coming all rhymey, I got the high grade
And I spit grimey, see me on iTunes, and they just buy me
So I move right here, Can't get by me
I got a whole album and it's all by me
I roll with the biro, Ryan had a baby
Now it's all hard work, now it's all lively

Back in the day when I gave mum backchat
She would try tell a man 'AH AH'
Now I do that if a mana try act bad
Gus got done but, Now he's a bad man
Din't go vegas, or play blackjack
Beat up dealers, robbed man's afghan
Now mans got blue cheese and dank fam
Write bars like Anne Frank
I get live on a hype occasion
One fan from show tried a snidey statement
Tried to put Wiz down, tryna diss Jamaican
So I shagged mans mum for the violation
Like oh
Why you tryna fight with Statham
Tryna war with four of ya
Getting drawn in payments
Tell a man I wanna chat let their thought amaze em
When they can't pool thoughts when they draw a statement
On tracks, me I don't rhyme when I rap
Me I just grime when I rhyme puff dank in a flat
Toast, anchor on that, if i got a hankerin, jammin on that
Mans overly on it, I got the dough in my wallet
And when I pull on my pocket I'm seeing permanent profit
It's like the man they wanna chat like they Capone or Gotti
And they be running with the shotty for a kick or a hobby
I know a couple man they riding really didn't seem properly
Better if everybody do it tell me where did the body be
Tryna get some money tryna get into property
Everybody wanna stomach coz I'm doing it cockily
I mother fucking hate slacker
I don't role with no out the backers, no I don't role with no lazy man 'cause
That makes man flip like acrobatics
Like oh my, golly these guys want test like i won't try act dramatic
I'll Learn the role then I'll smash the practise, then turn up late
Shag the actress, see verb with the limp bars die for acting
And a also look like a bag has packed him, and the also rare, fans are clapping
But the girls embarrased to try an' clap the act
I'm like, nowadays every body wanna talk like they got something to spray
But nothing comes out when they loading clips, they just talking shit
But still man wanna chat like they guns are blazing, got great form
I'm in great form, and I'm gratetful for that withdraw, I've been on tour
I ain't been on telly, then i fuck off home like I piss off kelly
But man went from cotching to pingu, to blotting, to hindus
Then back to the igloos, I'm cold
Our tier man are just big news
That's when the gali wan' llick on semis
I come back to the flow like a pistol, ready
I'm getting back from the show, pissed already
And I'm bad with the bone in my bitches belly
I got a bag from Michone from the ghetto lady you know
You one of them wouldn't and couldn't man
That couldn't afford a bag of the Buddha man, me?
I'ma jetlag and then travel and then go into camp for a can on a boulevard, you?
You went clown now you're talking all loud and you tell a man lowe of the western wild out
Even though higher man think that's a lie that gotta you man what that's about
Coming back from Thailand, with dreadlocks, a skin condition
A vague notion of how to throw some sort of kick
Does not qualify you as a fucking therapist
You eggy eggy breds, yeah?
On the real though
I dont know nothing bout whats-his-face, but whats-his-face know something bout Wizzy
I grew up on Marley and Macy and Lizzy and Wu Tang, Rumcon, Fiddy and Dizzee
Chilling with fizzy and bizzy and gizzy, growed with streez and meags and billy
Shot food with seller man halves now kilian, catches man on the can that's brilliant
Progress, got my own test, I don't need your one, two's get drawn on
You man are falling asleep with the porn on
Me I'm on stage tryna keep my own drawers on, simple as that
I give em a sprinkle of swag, now they wanna sink in a lap, I ain't simple as that
And I ain't got a tip for a slag, I ain't tryna dip in a hag, lets go now
Brighton town where you find me, I'm on the high street
