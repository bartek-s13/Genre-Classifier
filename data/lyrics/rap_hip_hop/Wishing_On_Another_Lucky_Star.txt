Your friends may lie
The truth can come from strangers
If I knew why
We wouldn't be in this danger
Leaning out the window of my car
And wishing on another lucky star
Life is long
It is not made to measure
You will go on
The same in pain and pleasure
Wondering how we ever got this far...
And wishing on another lucky star
Life goes on
As sure as the sky
It's come and gone
In the wink of an eye
You leave your home
In the wings of the night
You will never die
The world is cold
The heart gets torn and tattered
The one you hold
It can be dropped and shattered
Leaning out the window of my car
And wishing on another lucky star
