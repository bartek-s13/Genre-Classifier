I been thinking that you changed for a while
I think about you and then I picture your smile
You was there, you was always around
The person that picked me up when I was always down
Sometimes I think that you changed for the better
How was I cheating when we was always together?
Something you always asked
It was all in the moment don't feel like talking so baby, I gotta dash
Ooh-wee that's how you gonna do me?
You the only reason if you lose me, lose me, baby
Choose me, choose me baby
We was down, we came up together
Only reason we still here 'cause we stuck together
No matter the situation and no matter the weather
I always asked if you was leaving and you'd always say, "Never"

Baby, do you care about me? Oh yeah, yeah
Baby, I need you around me, oh yeah, yeah
Put that on God, baby, you what I need
You something special, you said that you wouldn't leave
Was in the moment, I don't know why I would cheat
I let 'em get in between, I let 'em get in between yeah
Baby, do you care about me? Oh yeah, yeah
Baby, I need you around me, oh yeah, yeah
Put that on God, baby, you what I need
You something special, you said that you wouldn't leave
Was in the moment, I don't know why I would cheat
I let 'em get in between, I let 'em get in between yeah

All the times I was whippin' and we was just cooped up
Favorite song to sing to me while I'm driving was "Boo'd Up"
I would always tell her that I ain't ready to lose her
When she found I was cheatin' everything confused her
I like you natural you better without no makeup
You say I'm looking daddyish when I go get my shape up
Always talk about it, we know that them niggas hate us
Favorite caption on the 'Gram no emoji was "Fuck the haters"
Yeah, and you know I still care for you
Was there for you
And baby girl, I'm still here with you
Yeah, and you know you my little baby
Girl you got me going crazy
Ooh, you changed my mood
Baby girl, you got me confused
Yeah, I don't, I don't know what to do

Baby, do you care about me? Oh yeah, yeah
Baby, I need you around me, oh yeah, yeah
Put that on God, baby, you what I need
You something special, you said that you wouldn't leave
Was in the moment, I don't know why I would cheat
I let 'em get in between, I let 'em get in between yeah
