"Alpha E" Ace Miles FT: Smokey, Munchii, and Cashews
Verse 1: Munchii
We're a group of young thugs, that drink out some mugs
We get very high, so get out the way
We're very Notorious, We were born in Minnesota
We drink all the soda, We buy all the shoes
We get swagg for free, We kill all the wanna be's
We never look like fools, cause we got 7 pools
Hook
We are the Alpha E, We going to the stars
We are very rich, We get the sexy girls
Verse 2: Smokey
WEED! Yea, Smoke that stuff
All the time, This is my mind
You can't control us
Our minds are free, look at this wanna be
He don't have a car, Cause he don't get so far
We got ourselves, a very sexy Bugatti
Hook
Verse 3: Cashews

We made all the laws, Then we went to the club
We be rocking Taylors, I be wearing Nike
