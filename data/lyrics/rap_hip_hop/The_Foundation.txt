When I look you in your eyes I can see my own
Straight love manifested in flesh and bone
You's a breath of fresh air in this world of shit
You was born to be a soldier don't ever forget
Hit back when hit, use force that's effective
All these bitches and women—son, please be selective
This is California can't stick your dick in everything
We will survive necessarily by any means
Let no man ever hold you down or suppress you
It's the 90's—the police just arrest you
Disrespect you, on occasion take life
By the time you come of age they'll probably blast on sight
It's a shame they protect them but try to serve us
When your neck is on the line, stand ground then bust
In God we trust but just in case keep it loaded and locked
Ready to rock then shake the spot, the Foundation

You came from a long line of killers and drug dealers
Who forever smoke bud, so it's probably in your blood
Realize you can only run the streets so long
Then the streets run you into the ground then gone
It's kinda ruff trying to teach you what's right from wrong
Same shit different day, it's the same ol' song
If the time ever comes that I meet my match
Take control of my assets, fuck startin' from scratch
Take care of your mother, keep yourself on track
Just cause niggas get behind you don't mean they got your back
Beware of the serpent 'cause there's a time in life
The mothafucker will strike and try to make you loose sight
Don't be a fake motherfucker tryin' to keep shit real
Fill cassettes with idle threats with no guts to kill
Son if you ever pull heat then use it
If you got a chance to walk away then do it
Total domination takes full concentration
In all situations, a solid foundation (yeah yeah)
You are the foundation, beginning of a new generation
I remember hospital hallway, pacin'
I was anxious as fuck to see your face shine
Only to find that yours looked like mine
So it's like I'm livin' twice at the exact same time
In this life you can't press stop then press rewind
Gotta live to the fullest never follow behind..
..no man, have your own plan, expand your mind
Ain't no paper thin game to raise wannabe thugs
This is nothing but love via sattelite Muggs
Take heed when it's your turn to bring new life
Make sure it's the woman you gonna make your wife
Be prepared for the worst, but expect the best
No matter where life takes you come home to the West
Survival takes more than just gats and guns
That's words to live by from a father to a son
