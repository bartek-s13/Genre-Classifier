Hey, alright hey alright
Yo this is headliner from the arrested development
And right now you have missed out our celebration
Celebration of life death the destroying of our ancestors
Let me hear you say wow, wow
Say yay yay
Say wow wow yay yay wow yay wow yay...
Wow wow say yay say wow wow yay yay
Wow wow yay yay wow yay wow yay...
I am everyday people
You see I am everyday people
See I was resting at the park minding my own (my own)
Business as I kick up the treble tone (the treble tone)
On my radio tape player box, right (box, right)
Just loud enough so folks could hear it's hype, see
(hype, see)
Outta nowhere comes the woman I'm dating (I'm dating)
Investigation maybe she was demonstrating
But nevertheless I was pleased (I was pleased)
My day was going great and my soul was at ease
Until a group of brothers started bugging out
Drinking the 40 oz, going the nigga route (the nigga route)
Disrespecting my black queen (black queen)
Holding their crotches and being obscene (obscene)
At first I ignored them cause see I know their type (I know their type)
They got drunk and got guns and they wanna fight (they wanna fight)
And they see a young couple having a time that's good (time that's good)
And their egos wanna test a brother's manhood
So they came to test Speech cause of my hair-do
And the loud bright colors that I wear
I was a target cause I'm a fashion misfit (misfit)
And the outfit that I'm wearing brothers dissing it
Well I stay calm and pray the niggas leave me be
But they're squeezing parts of my date's anatomy (anatomy)
Why, Lord, do brothers have to drill me?
'Cause if I start to hit this man they'll have to kill me
You see I am everyday people
You see I am everyday people
I told the niggas please let us pass, friend
I said please 'cause I don't like killing Africans
But he wouldn't stop and I ain't Ice Cube
But I had to take the brother out for being rude
And like I said before I was mad by then
It took three or four cops to pull me off of him (pull me off of him)
But that's the story y'all of a black man (black man)
Acting like a nigga and get stomped by an African
You see I am everyday people
You see I am everyday people
Everyday everyday everyday everyday
The moral of the story is
You never know in what you are stepping into
You can get stabbed and shot killed or hurt
Its not even worth it
