Stack for the road
Selling out shows
Back of the Tahoe Tahoe
Got all these scarred hoes
Game is at 50,000
But I feel like I'm just lost yo
Can’t Find My Way Home, Yeah
Can’t Find My Way Home, Way Home
Can’t Find My Way Home, Way Home
Can’t Find My Way Home, Yeah
Can’t Find My Way Home
Can’t Find My Way Home

Don't know what to do
I be on the loose
Yea homies let me out the pound
Now this music what I found
And y’all just follow the sound
Now I'm tryna chase this pound
Get this cash in my account
Get a feeling for this music boi
Find a way that you can use it boi
Wait till all the people view it boi
Now they asking for a fusion boi
Like nah, I don't want features
I like to work alone u in the bleachers
I like to blast out my studio speakers
Mixing and mastering who was the teacher
I taught myself
Came from the bottom like straight outta well
You didn't help
My room was feelin like a cell
Locked up for going through hell
But I don't need nothing
Made it here so why you bluffin
Hit the mic and women blushin
Finally made it all the blood was gushing
Finally made it all the blood was gushing

Can’t Find My Way Home, Yeah
Can’t Find My Way Home, Way Home
Can’t Find My Way Home, Way Home
Can’t Find My Way Home, Yeah
Can’t Find My Way Home
Can’t Find My Way Home


Don't even wanna do a second verse
Push myself I wanna get this work
Feel like I'm growing right out the dirt
Planting platin what's this album worth
Drop another tape and then I'm stacking all this cash
The way im workin got em shakin like some stupid hoes ass
Damn what's up ex’s
Not -tacion I'm like hey Alexis
Not amazon, no two day
Workin' music ain't no Sunday
Workin' on this like no breaks
Looking down that so far away

I’ve Been Working So Much Lately That I, That I
Can’t Find My Way Home
Can’t Find My Way Home
Can’t Find My Way Home, Yeah
Can’t Find My Way Home, Way Home
Can’t Find My Way Home, Way Home
Can’t Find My Way Home, Yeah
Can’t Find My Way Home
Can’t Find My Way Home
