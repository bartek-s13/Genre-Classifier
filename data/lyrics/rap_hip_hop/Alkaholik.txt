(Come On)
Xzibit (Yeah)
E-Dub

It's that millenium ridiculous flow, I never let go
Niggas gettin' knocked out is part of my show
Let them know who they fuckin' with yo, a rhyme wrangler
Tri-angular push-up the hillside strangler
Dangle a, nigga by the ankle off the balcony
Now let his punk ass go, look out below (below)
It's a tale of two cities, come out when the sun go down
We officially not fuckin' around
Stuck in the ground, fitted with a suit in a pine box
With my fresh pressed khakis and a slingshot
So heatbox all day in a nigga face
And all you bitches see the dick that you should've ate

Call it what you wanna call it
I'm a fucking Alkaholik
Bring it if you really want it
Ain't gotta put no extras on it
Call it what you wanna call it
I'm a fucking Alkaholik
Bring it if you really want it
Ain't gotta put no extras on it
Yo, I'm in the zone, and lyrically gone
Got the spot blown, (Boom) Oklahoma
Watch the aroma, catch those who love me
My underground dirty cats on dune buggies
I be the type to take your watch and flaunt it
Kidnap T. Lewis and Jimmy Jam on it
Yo, I bang a nigga head 'til his neck pop
Do a KRS-One to a "Black Cop"
X and Es, out for the cream
Get the money, while you stay broker than Al Bundy
Uhh, give it to y'all, in "Any Given Sunday"
With J. Foxx name the spot, make it hot
(I hate E so much right now)
Blow it down hooker bounce, come off the ropes like J. Snuka
(X: Two fly motherfuckers) You can't fuck with it
Backed by Open Bar, so y'all forget it

Call it what you wanna call it
I'm a fucking Alkaholik
Bring it if you really want it
Ain't gotta put no extras on it
Call it what you wanna call it
I'm a fucking Alkaholik
Bring it if you really want it
Ain't gotta put no extras on it
J-McEnroe, cam smashin', party crashin'
I eat MCs like a ration
I'm sockin' niggas in their goatees
I leave you stiffer than that fool on my basketball trophies
I'm in the room with 10 Gs, counting ten Gs
'Cause we need a bag of weed (can you smell weed?)
Now we need ten dimes, to blow on deez like wind chimes
Time to close the blinds 'cause you all in mines
I bought a bottle for the session, and did not share it
Drink so much Captain Mo' all I need is a parrot
You took the Alkaholik challenge, and lost your balance
You underground, we under water drinkin' liquor by the gallons

Slurred words, double vision, brain bustin', head rushin'
If I'm too drunk to walk, I'll rock a party on crutches
And still rush the roughest MC who wanna get it
Forget it, it's Likwit, Tha Liks and, Xzibit
Ca-Tash on the blast the final piece to the puzzle
I slap bitches on the ass, I slap pits up out the muzzle
I shuffle with the microphone, bang rhymes consistent
You wack and I'm Ca-Tash and that's the motherfuckin' difference
For instance, "21 and Over" set your clocks back (Tick-tock-tick)
Still standin' where the rocks at
Two-thousand-one, we still young guns that's Restless
(Thirty niggas, sixty hoes) and that's the motherfuckin' guest list
Call it what you wanna call it
I'm a fucking Alkaholik
Bring it if you really want it
Ain't gotta put no extras on it
Call it what you wanna call it
I'm a fucking Alkaholik
Bring it if you really want it
Ain't gotta put no extras on it
