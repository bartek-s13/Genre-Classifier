Shout out
Ohh, yeah

Swear I be sitting here thinking 'bout the shit that we’ve been through
And all I know is girl I owe you

A hunnid, hunnid, a hunnid favors
I owe you a hunnid favors
Hunnid, hunnid, hunnid favors
Hunnid favors

Niggas all talk, it'll never change
Keep on choosin do your thang
All them favors, I call her like a driver
Drowning in that pussy, and I’m the sole survivor
Vodka, hunnid flavors, GT watermelon
She always do me favors, and I don’t never tell her
GT yellow mango, I love to drink juice
Owe her a hunnid favors, I call her my hunnid proof
Man I heard about an angel

Now I’m sitting here sippin' on the last bit of vodka
All I ever see is your face
Swear I be sitting here thinking bout the shit that you’ve been doing
And all I know is girl I’ll owe
Hunnid, hunnid, a hunnid favors
I'll do you a hunnid favors
Hunnid, hunnid, a hunnid favors
Yeah

And now I’m sitting here sippin' on the last bit of GT
And all I ever see is your face
A hunnid favors (shout out)
Ohh, nothing less (shout out)
Hunnid, hunnid (yeah, yeah)

Priceless with the life
Rollin' on them dice
Spent a mill' on a flight
Flew back and she bounced back
High speed
All gold
Lord of the Ring
We live that life big time
Big time
A hunnid times I gave my bitch the sunshine
Harley Davis
Harley Davis
Twin cam, I gave my bitch a hunnid favors
Now I’m sitting here sippin' on the last bit of vodka
And all I ever see is your face
And I be sitting here thinking bout the shit that you’ve been doing
And all I know is I owe you a

Hunnid, hunnid, a hunnid favors

Hunnid, hunnid, a hunnid favors
Yeah

And now I’m sitting here sippin' on the last bit of GT
And all I ever see is your face

Ohh, nothing less
Hunnid, hunnid

You was a college student abusing the credit union
The music was way too loud, the tuition was fuckin stupid
And me I was runnin' wild hittin' licks in my mothers' Buick
Confusing, you like my style even though I was broke and doing
Stick em ups, you wanna pick em up
Inside your Civic Plus the difference was
I wasn't rich as fuck you still would depend on us
And I missed the crush that we had every time winter December come
And we had tempers and arguments, disagreements and senses from
Cupid himself, and I'm shootin' himself
And the paramedics won't come even if you scream for help
Don't let love die, you regroovin' yourself
And I'm losing now too looking at you boo hoo from what's dealt
So as I reminisce the coupon that we used to split at Rally's
On your mothers couch your little brother in the alley
You say K. Dot your page got that pay that Birdman and Jay got
One day you'll reap what you sow, now I reap for us both
That's one hunnid
Now I’m sitting here sippin' on the last bit of vodka
And all I ever see is your face
And I be sitting here thinking bout the shit that you’ve been doing
And all I know is I owe you a

Hunnid, hunnid, a hunnid favors
I'll do you a hunnid favors
Hunnid, hunnid, a hunnid favors
Yeah

And now I’m sitting here sippin' on the last bit of GT
And all I ever see is your face
A hunnid favors
Ohh, nothing less
