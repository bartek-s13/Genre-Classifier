Kill TEC piece, three feet tall, running these streets, we ain't even crawl
Choppa goin' in, hit it for ya, raised on the East, no front yard
Hunnid round drum, won't run out of ammo, knife on the gun, we gon' rob a nigga bando
.223 with the sprite like Rambo, tote it to the grave, beat a nigga with a hambone
Redbone bitch, I'ma get in her backbone, big bag on me, I don't pay tax on 'em
Baggin' up O.G. right about a flash-up, Glock no safety, nigga, what ya MAC on?
These niggas bitin' my swag like Soulja, nigga been poppin' them tags on VLONE
Geeked up, rockin' my shades like poker, poured up sippin' on Act', no keystone

Yeah, diamonds on me, I got a Wok and I got a tree
Niggas be hatin', they envying me, I keep the bands on me, oh (Bands)
Yeah, Patek (Patek), that shit put ice on my neck (On my neck)
Just went and fucked and I left (I fucked her), that lil' bitch I slept, uh (Bitch)
Niggas be cappin', they lying (Lying), big backwood, I'm flyin' (I'm flying)
Kill TEC piece, you dyin' (Brr), big rock bands this time
Ooh, shoot at you (Slide through)
Dang

Brought with that Actavis, no, you can't lean on me, hop on the flight and I switch up the scenery
