Live long and prosper, Star Trek
I'm a star and I ain’t been parred yet
Try par and see how far you get
I'll be at your neck in just a sec
I'll be at your neck it's not a threat
I don't pet, I get me some respect
On the net lookin' out for a buy to let
Big yard in a country where I slept
I mean where I sleep
Got a pretty peng ting in my own suite
She's so sweet and I'm on heat
I try keep it neat and be discreet
Big feet and it's making it hard to creep
And I'm in too deep it's hard to cheat
Got spars from the street, but we hardly speak
Still I hardly weep, I won’t accept defeat, I’m hard to beat
I pattern up the beat, it’s got an easy vibe, I want an easy ride
As long as I can provide for the fam, I’m live
And I reside where the hell I decide
I’ve decided I’m the biggest baddest thing alive
Number Johnny 5, the prototype
I’m photogenic even in the night, with a lack of light
You see me shining
I ain’t outta sight, I ain’t got a hyping
And you ain't gotta like it
I’m so excited, I ain’t gotta fight it, second sight
I might be a psychic, second-sight, I might reignite it
Get what you deserve, you invite it
Swerving through the dirt, clocking mileage
Looking stylish, I ain’t got a stylist
And my vibe is violent
Likkle man be silent
You're a fly in the eyes of a giant
I been flying high so long, I’m tired
I ain’t tired enough to retire
But I’m tired of preaching to the choir
I got what you require
You deny you’re a liar, liar
Set fire to your attire
I supply, you're a buyer, prior
I was the guy on the flyer
I ain’t letting it fly, you’re a trier
Try test me and I'll get the UMP, yeah I'm the umpire
Caution when you inquire
Right or wrong, I fight for what I desire
Call me Rascal or call me Sire
Why? ‘Cause I rule the Shire
And I'm

Blessed
Work rest and invest
Got it sussed I don't guess
Spoke to God and he told me that I'm
Blessed
Be a boss and be the best
Better say it with your chest
I don't stress I just finesse and yes I'm
Blessed

Blessin' blockin' up the road
See 'em droppin' like it's snow, mm hmm
Erratic chillin' at my home
It was rainy on the roads, mm hmm
Indecisive with your flow
Will I skip or will I won't, mm hmm
You will or won't I bet you choke
You ain't blessed you on the ropes (wait, wait)
Niggas knowing that I will
Overcompensate with thrilI, I just kill 'em prolifically
Too many mandem are moving fernickety
Rickety with it they dissin' my trickery
Intricate lyrics on top of the imagery
Me and my money are working in synergy
Cinematography all in my video
Look at the influence look at the mini-me's
Oi look at them bark up
Man saw the pussy when the pussy just park up
Manna got the matic in the attic he a hard nut
Calibrate the badness now a brudda feelin' charged up
Been around the world and never seen a brudda start up
Seen a brudda panic from the jabbin' to the
Heart, gut, chest, leg, back
Sitting where he sat I bet he wish he had armour
But, but you know that's irrelevant
I'm lookin' at a nigga like he suffering impediments
A brudda couldn't figure out how da Wizzy do it elegant
A brudda with da vigour tryna cover unintelligence
A man there with a matic kinda looking like he tepid
'Cause a brother caught him slippin' send him to the paramedic
And a brudda with the heart and soul of an elephant
Quiet and calm made more than the rest of 'em
Made more than dem man
Dem man run man down with ten man
Dat man done man ducked out lapped man
Now man's balling more than Henman
And they don't pay rent fam
Dat man got more cribs than dem man
Dem man ask man now for a ten pound
But it ain't that when dem man beg man
What you know about that fam
Man left the pack by the gaff in the trash can
Man couldn't have a backpack full of that when I'm
Whippin' a car worth more than a man's flat
Ay, but you know a man met man, came with the dead flow, dead hook, dead pan
Stare man down like dude you a dead man if you try spit
Those at the event fam
You are not
