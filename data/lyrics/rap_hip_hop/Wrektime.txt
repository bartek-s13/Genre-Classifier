(Where Brooklyn at?)
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
(Where Brooklyn at?)
(?) One, two, one two
(Rock the house)
(?) Cough like, well that’s that killa dealer


You're too light to fight, plus you're too thin to win
And who ya gonna call when I break your glass chin?
Mista Rippa, slicker than your sista
Turn down the lights, she got hit by the Vicksta
Keep a lid on your lip so your wig won't get split
Better have your joint cocked, my hand's comin' off my hip
This little nigga pumped the lead, that ass fled
Three of your boys wounded, three of your men dead
Time to hop to Iron (Steele) hilly, (Tek) get back to my (Steele) spilly
(Tek) Flat Foot comin' deep like (Steele) hillbilly
Can't hear the sirens, gotta block 'em out my mind
I gotta get away so I can do mo' crime
See my brethren down the block, risin' up out their spot
Puffin' meth in the hood where the spot is hot
My Timbs ease tension by stompin' necks when I'm vexed
Throw up your dick-beaters, kid, it's time to flex


(Steele) I am what I am
(Tek) And I do what I do
(Steele) Puff mad lye
(Tek) Catch wreck with my crew


Sent to represent the real heads
The dreads on the scene, now all the bumbaclot talk must dead
I walk the fence of stress and tension
Hit the Benz then hit the spliff with my friends
And catch mad wreck with my man Tek
(Tek) I am what I am
That's why my fans show respect when I slam sets
I don't front for you, your crew, even a stunt
Roll up the blunts, cuz real niggas do what they want
Big up to all original criminaals, the ill politicaal
And all Boot Camp Generaals
I be gettin' charged with my squad on the project step
And you'll regret when my mob flex
Glam to the man that sham when I hit 'em with tricks or 4-5-6 when I'm gamblin'
Collect your trap, then add it to my fat stack
Chill, I'll be back, right now I'm out to smoke the next sack


(Steele) Well I puff mad lye
(Tek) Catch wreck with my crew
(Steele) Puff mad lye
(Tek) Catch wreck with my crew
(Tek) Puff mad lye
(Steele) Catch wreck with my crew
(Tek) I am what I am
(Steele) And I do what I do
(Tek) Puff mad lye
(Steele) Catch wreck with my crew
(Tek We puff mad lye
(Steele) Catch wreck with my crew
(Tek) I am what I am
(Steele) And I do what I do


(Tek) It's goin' down
(Steele) The deal's been set and it's ready
(Tek) Strap up the arms cuz it's time to be jetty
(Steele) Ya niggas violated when you crossed that thin line
(Tek) Trespassed in Bucktown and now you're all mine
(Steele) Hey batty boy, (Tek) one move and you're dead
(Steele) Got my Glocks cocked and they're pointed atcha head
(Tek) Your operation's (Tek & Steele) dead and stinkin'
(Tek & Steele) Tied down with bricks in the East River sinkin'
(Tek) Got my hoodie on and my Timb boots, troop
(Steele) Kick your whole bottom row of fronts out, Duke
(Tek) Ya best protect your frame 'fore you tow out it, G
(Steele) I'm halfway sane, that's what the Lord tells me
(Tek) But I chose to disregard fuzz, (Steele) smoke buzz
(Tek) And lamp in the Camp with the rest of the (Tek & Steele) thugs, cuz
(Steele) I am what I am, and I do what I do
(Tek) Puff mad lye, catch wreck with my crew


(Steele) I am what I am
(Tek) And I do what I do
(Steele) Puff mad lye
(Tek) Catch wreck with my crew
X4
(Steele) Puff mad lye
(Tek) Catch wreck with my crew
X2
(Steele) I am what I am
(Tek) And I do what I do
(Steele) Puff mad lye
(Tek) Catch wreck with my crew


Smif-N-Wessun and we out like that
One time, , for your head two times and we out, yeah
Boot Camp Clik, roll thick
(Tek) That's that killa deala, kid
(Okay, we ready to rock)
