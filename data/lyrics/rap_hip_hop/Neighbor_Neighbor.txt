(Alton Joseph Valier/Huey Meaux)
Neighbour neighbour, don't you worry what goes on in my home
You're always looking for something to gossip about
You're running around from door to door
Shooting your mouth about things you don't know
Neighbour neighbour, don't you worry what goes on in my home
Neighbour neighbour, don't you worry 'bout how I treat my wife
You tell everybody we fuss and fight every night
You got troubles it's my trouble too
Something bad's gonna happen to you
Neighbour neighbour, don't you worry what goes on in my home
Neighbour neighbour, don't you worry about who knocks on my door
You're always running, pacing all over the floor
You're peeping and creeping through the hall
Keeping your great big ear glued to my wall
Neighbour neighbour, don't you worry what goes on in my home
Neighbour neighbour, don't you worry about who knocks on my door
You're always running, pacing all over the floor
You're peeping and creeping through the hall
Keeping your great big ear glued to my wall
Neighbour neighbour, don't you worry what goes on in my home
Neighbour neighbour, don't you worry 'bout how I treat my wife
You tell everybody we fuss and fight every night
You got troubles it's my trouble too
Something bad's gonna happen to you
Neighbour neighbour, don't you worry what goes on in my home
Neighbour neighbour, don't you worry what goes on in my home
