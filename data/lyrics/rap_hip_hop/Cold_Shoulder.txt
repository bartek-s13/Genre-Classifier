Baby told me slow down
You ain’t gotta finish that right now
Cause I don’t wanna deal with that
Now you on that shit again
Gotta put my phone down
What is going on right now
They showing who they are though
That’s why I keep the lawn mower
Pre hook:
Cold shoulder, at an all time high
Not on purpose, I’m just dealin with life
I’m just dealin with life, I’m just dealin with life
Everything I been dealing with trife
I been working all day all night
Pardon me if I come off rude I’m just high Probably, let a nigga learn something sometimes
Let a nigga burn one one time
Everybody wanna criticize goin off at the mouth before they use they ears and eyes I don’t know why
Hook:
(Ooooh) off tree to escape, few drinks to escape
I don’t know when to stop, I don’t know when to stop
Off tree to escape, few G’s to the face
I don’t know when to stop, I don’t know when to stop
Off tree to escape, few drinks to escape
I don’t know when to stop, I don’t know when to stop
Three drinks to the face, two G’s to the face
I don’t know when to stop, I don’t know when to stop
Verse 2:
Everything I’m seeing online
Feels like Saturday night live
But this shit is real life
Something don’t feel right
Baby told me put my phone down again, before I go drowning in my own mind
Wish I can turn it off sometimes
Pre hook:
Cold shoulder, at an all time high
Not on purpose, I’m just dealin with life
I’m just dealin with life, I’m just dealin with life
Everything I been dealing with trife
I been working all day all night
Pardon me if I come off rude I’m just high Probably, let a nigga learn something sometimes
Let a nigga burn one one time
Everybody wanna criticize goin off at the mouth before they use they ears and eyes I don’t know why
Hook:
(Ooooh) off tree to escape, few drinks to escape
I don’t know when to stop, I don’t know when to stop
Off tree to escape, few G’s to the face
I don’t know when to stop, I don’t know when to stop
Off tree to escape, few drinks to escape
I don’t know when to stop, I don’t know when to stop
Three drinks to the face, two G’s to the face
I don’t know when to stop, I don’t know when to stop
