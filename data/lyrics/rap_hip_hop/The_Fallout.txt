I felt my heart rate begin to
Choke out the fucking noise like I was cursed
It felt like storms were directly overhead
And where I went it poured

And in a flash came the flood
That washed over my eyes
Now I could see inside the room of the blind
I lost myself inside
And as I fell into the black I left my past to die

Tonight we'll sail to the edge of the world
And let the stars fall down
You'll put your head in my arms as we wonder:
Is there anything we could've done?
Why not try, to start a revolution?
And in the morning find a new sunrise
Tonight we'll sail to the edge of the world
And watch the stars fall down
As our world ignites!

What will we do? Will we just sit back and watch?
I'm sick of apathy dictating how I think and how I talk
I'd like to know as I lay down to die
I still control the way the think, before they make up my mind
As I gaze up towards the sky
I feel lost in the world of the blinding lights
We all hope to reach these heights
But we're all so afraid of the fall
No one will take the fall
We're all so comfortable with living in our sheltered homes
No one will take the fall
But if we try, we could all change the world

Tonight we'll sail to the edge of the world
And let the stars fall down
You'll put your head in my arms as we wonder:
Is there anything we could've done?
Why not try to start a revolution?
And in the morning find a new sunrise
Tonight we'll sail to the edge of the world
And watch the stars fall down
(As our world ignites!)

We are gathered here today as brothers and sisters
Not bound by fate
But by the understanding that our survival
Lies only in harmony

We, have only one life to live
And then we're cast into the night
Will you carry the torch and
Be the keeper of the light?!
Or will you let darkness fall?!
Or will you let darkness fall?!
Tonight we'll sail to the edge of the world
Tonight we'll sail to the edge of the world

Tonight we'll sail to the edge of the world...
And let the stars fall down...
You'll put your head in my arms as we wonder:
Is there anything...
Is there anything...
