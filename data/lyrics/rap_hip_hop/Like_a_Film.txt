I roll my weed and I prevail
The shit go deeper than a well
I hit the trap and do it well
Baby, keep a couple bricks up on the cell
I miss my niggas in the cell
I pray they winnin' they appeal
I can't wait until they free my right hand, we gone get this shit for real (Let's go)
Like ten years in the field
You know my life is like a film (Let's go)
And everyday I live a movie, baby, it'd be hard to tell you what is real (You know)
See I don't drip, I spill (Whoo)
I take your chick as well (Let's go)
I buy her new Chanel (Let's go)
But she don't kiss and tell (Ayy)

I want the four of this, I come from servin' fiends in the corners
All of my niggas, we hustle regardless, we gotta feed all our sons and our daughters
We gotta finesse the market, pull up with shooters, my niggas are heartless
I was a youngin' in Gucci and Pradas, all of my VVS diamonds are dancing (Yeah, yeah)
I'm getting money with the same niggas, had to spend some bands on some new clothes
I can't fuck with any old bitches, I just catch a flight and find some new hoes
I go hard 'till we all winning, I just hit the trap, I'm in a new zone
Hit this loud, I'm in Pluto, gotta keep it on me when I do road
I roll my weed and I prevail
The shit go deeper than a well
I hit the trap and do it well
Baby, keep a couple bricks up on the cell
I miss my niggas in the cell
I pray they winnin' they appeal
I can't wait until they free my right hand, we gone get this shit for real (Let's go)
Like ten years in the field
You know my life is like a film (Let's go)
And everyday I live a movie, baby, it'd be hard to tell you what is real (You know)
See I don' drip, I spill (Yeah)
I take your chick as well (Let's go)
I buy her new Chanel (Yeah)

Broke men like broke bitches, broke bitches like rich men
And I had to deal with two bitches, I didn't know they were sisters
Now I have to open accounts every time Huncho's in Zurich
Tax back when I'm buying in Munich
Yeah, just got six pounds of Cookies (Cookies)
Nah, I ain't been a rookie (Never been rookie)
When I came as a rookie, I got me a cheque like I'm Simmons
I look in the pot, it still simmers
I ran out of patience for gimmicks, yeah
This weed therapeutic, yeah
Sat with my same role, my blueprint, yeah
The shit is exclusive, yeah

Still undisputed, bitch
I roll my weed and I prevail
The shit go deeper than a well
I hit the trap and do it well
