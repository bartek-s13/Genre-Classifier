Oh no, I might not wake up, yeah
She sees me, she's falling in love, yeah
Remember when I wasn’t enough
Got the money now I'm enough
Oh no, I might not wake up, yeah
She sees me, she's falling in love, yeah
Remember when I wasn’t enough
Got the money now I'm enough

We can't go back to the way it was
Listen close, bitch, I'm only gonna say it once
Henny and Coke and a Perky, yeah, just for fun
I hate your words, they feel just like a loaded gun
I know you miss me, that's a lesson we'll learn
I'm driving fast, bitch, I'm starting to swerve
I don’t care, soon I’ll be buried by dirt
I know you hope you hear your name in this verse
I'm cutting you loose and burning this bridge
I know you’re hurt, but I promise you'll live
I don't care about that shit that you give
Don't forget, I’ll break your heart with a kiss, yeah
C-C-C-Cutting you loose and burning this bridge
I know you're hurt, but I promise you'll live
I don't care about that shit that you give
Don't forget, I'll break your heart with a kiss, yeah

Oh no, I might not wake up, yeah

Got the money now I'm enough
Oh no, I might not wake up, yeah
She sees me, she's falling in love, yeah
Remember when I wasn't enough
