Couple hundred miles away
I can’t wait to burn these yesterdays
I just need to kiss you and hold you and love you and fuck you my baby
Couple hundred days apart
I can't wait to heal what’s in your heart
I just need to kiss you and hold you and love you and fuck you my baby

Maybe I should die blissful
Moving forward in a lie, that's just Wishful
Excited to forget you
Taking my problems to bed with you
The truth hard to swallow, so choke you harder
Left my soul hallow, so I'm pushing farther
Lights dim, Sinatra blasting baby
Kush and gin, Until we're blasted baby
Going deep, And now we past it baby
Like it never happened baby

Couple hundred miles away
I can’t wait to burn these yesterdays
I just need to kiss you and hold you and love you and fuck you my baby
Couple hundred days apart
I can't wait to heal what’s in your heart
I just need to kiss you and hold you and love you and fuck you my baby


You’re so far from me tonight
Way too far from me tonight
Tonight, yeah yeah
Baby come to me
I can’t stop wandering in my mind
Baby come to me
Before I’m gone
Before I’m gone
Come to me
I’m tired of chasing all your fantasies
Without chasing mine

3-3-6 in the air tonight
In the air tonight
3-3-6 in the air tonight
In the air tonight
In the air tonight
In the air tonight
Babe it’s in the air tonight
Breathing my deceiving demons, strangle hope into you
The truth is hard to swallow, when I'm choking you blue
Like maybe if we're fucking
All our problems are fixed
Or maybe fixing is, forgetting 336
Far far far far from the truth is
That I'm ready to support you
I'm ready to give
You my vulnerability
Excuse my inability to see what's right in front of me
Front of me

3-3-6 in the air tonight
In the air tonight
3-3-6 in the air tonight
In the air tonight
In the air tonight
In the air tonight
Babe it’s in the air tonight
