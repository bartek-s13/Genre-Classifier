<<<<<<< HEAD
Let me ask you something
Don't stop, I'm not finished yet
Do you ever ask yourself...
Don't stop, I'm not finished yet
When are they ever gonna stop?
Do you ever ask yourself...
Don't stop, I'm not finished yet
When are they gonna stop making those hits, man?
Do you ever ask yourself...
Don't stop, I'm not finished yet
When are they gonna stop making us dance?
Do you ever ask yourself... when those Bad Boys are GONNA STOP MAKING ALL THAT MONEY?!

I lick shots at intruders
Take the coke money and invest in computers
Tryin' to reach the next level, Rolex with the ice bezel
Coming through the ghetto, in a Porsche Carrera
For now I'll play the back of the cruiser
Light up a sack for the three time losers
Pour out some beer, bust off the Ruger
Ladies and gentleman, bullets will leave you tremblin'
Shooken up, I got my Cuban mami cooking up
We got it all from her-on to fishscale
New York to Israel, get locked, I'm gettin' bail
My style is flashy like the five with strobes
Goons around the globe, honeys wearing silk robes
Time to flip the script, bust the whip
Legend with the chip, dark blue with my trunk dipped
To the Feds: catch me if you can
I'ma still transport with my man on the Peter Pan
Quick to get there, bury the bricks in the sand
They think I want a tan, I'm waitin' on a hunnid grand
So I can hit the mote' and take a shower
Head back to the airport, and now that money in the tower
Stash box with the key
L to the O to the X, you'll see
Bad Boy, Bad Boy, what you gonna do
What you gonna do when they come for you
Don't stop, I'm not finished yet
You'll see, you'll see
Bad Boy, Bad Boy, what you gonna do
What you gonna do when they come for you
Don't stop, I'm not finished yet
You'll see, you'll see

See? It's 1996, man
And we gonna do the same thing to you we did to you in '95
We gon' keep hittin' you in your head with all that
FLAAAAAAAAAVVAAAAAAAAA!!!

Yeah aight then, you better act like you know
L to the O, X amount of flow
Ain't nothin' change but the range since I got the inf'
Dot on your head, take all your strength
Yeah, I'm in it for the green
I'll get up in your seams
While you sonning me like a nigga from Queens
My tape in your dual cassette running me
Wanna get in front of me playa, but you can't get none of me
Better off gunnin' me, with hot slugs numbing me
'Cause you and I both know, the flow is coming, B
Don't stop, I'm not finished yet
When you want it? now or later?
I get mine and slide like a fresh pair of 'gators
With my mega click, involved with Montega bricks
Niggas is mega sick, and you know we roll mega-thick
Up north where they bust your man
In the custom van, interrupt your plans
Now it's back to grams, damn, ain't that somethin'?
All that for frontin', what you gon' do? Nothing!
So let's keep things rationalized
Everything I write butter, nationalize
I'm into gettin' money, twistin' honeys
Niggas is buyin' coupes while you on the stoop lookin' funny
I'm a scorer, shorty love the whole aura
Pussy wasn't all that; that's why I never called her
It's all about quick whips and fat nicks
Gats with mad clips, TVs in your whips
Don't stop, I'm not finished yet
My style tight like Gotti when I touch you
Seasoned Picatti, or Versace joints with the buckle
Get the facts, I'm tryna get the Beamer with the hatch
Cop one for my man, so our shits match
Runnin' around all crazy, twistin' honeys back
And breakin' niggas that come to gamble with small stacks
Really though, screw y'all; I never knew y'all
Your click be like yellow lights, I'm runnin' through y'all
Bad Boy, Bad Boy, what you gonna do
What you gonna do when they come for you
Don't stop, I'm not finished yet
You'll see, haha, you'll see
Bad Boy, Bad Boy, what you gonna do
What you gonna do when they come for you
Don't stop, I'm not finished yet
You'll see, haha, you'll see

Yo, hard as it is to make a buck I ain't tryna get stuck
So I'ma keep handlin' beef like I don't give a fuck
It's all about respect, TEC-9s, and papes
Big house in Italy, in the yard with honeys crushin' grapes
So I go down to my steam room and give a long prayer
Knowing that one day I'll be Sheek Louchian the mayor
Don't stop, I'm not finished yet
Fatigued out in my house or office
Blunt spots and crooked cops can't grow shit
So the town supports this (uh-huh)
My staff rollin' in Jags, Cruisers, and Coupes
Givin' parades, and holdin' rallies for the lifers; groups
So what you gwan' do when they come for you
The same thing you been doing
Eye screwing, and bubble gum chewing (woooo!)
While me and my mans are pursuin'
Who you think the ladies are enhancin'?
Rocking Vansons while I'm dancing in the mansion
So cheers to the life of the ice in your chains and your watches
And you'll see how we locks this
Don't stop, I'm not finished yet
Bad Boy, Bad Boy, what you gonna do
What you gonna do when they come for you
You'll see, you'll see
Don't stop, I'm not finished yet
Bad Boy, Bad Boy, what you gonna do
What you gonna do when they come for you
Don't stop, I'm not finished yet
You'll see, you'll see

Click, click... Uhh, uhh, uhh

Niggas talkin' it but ain't livin' it
Cristal pop, I'm sippin' it, mob hats and lizard shit
'Gator trunks, bitch
Rollin' blunts with the williest of the Willie
Hitchlink cock, M-1's and nine millis
Stories like a motherfucker (that's right)
Model bitch is wonderin' if I'ma fuck with her
Don't stop, I'm not finished yet
She know, I treat my bitches like Ivana
Dolce &amp; Gabbana drippin', Big Poppa never slippin'
H-class diamonds shinin'
Dinner with wifey, winin', dinin'
Smokin' cigars in Bogota with Colombian niggas
Named Panama and Englique and shit (wooo!)
Games we play, life-endin'
Bitches bendin' over with ease for a pair of Mo-schi-no jeans
And Donna Karan tank top, I got your bank stopped
Singles on top, Benjamins under the rest of 'em (don't stop!)
Advancin' from duplex to mansions
Stashin' keys, hidin' Gs overseas, VCRs in my Vs
Game elevates, money I make
Into stocks and real estates, bitch
Jet skiing in the Caribbean
White sands, discussin' plans with my mans
Dark blue Land, smoke tint, chrome rims and a system
That leaves my rear views tremblin'
What you gonna do when Poppa catch an attitude?
Drop to your knees and show gratitude
Kiss my ring, it's a Frank White thing, I stay potent
Bitches devoted, take my dick and deep throat it

You'll see
Don't stop
