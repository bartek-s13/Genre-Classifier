I’m prepared for the worst case
Gotta stack me enough cake
She had plenty of heartbreaks
Gotta tell me how love taste
Now I’m back in the booth
Telling me stories but lacking the truth
What it feels like but I never assume
Was going so good... but we gradually losing the vibe
Said I wasn’t used to your type
But girl I was looking to try
That’s truthful advice
I’m tryna get used to this life
You see what I do with a mic
Let’s move it aside
Rather be making the dough
So I gotta stay on the low
Ain’t taking it slow
I never have faith in these hoes
Just know that I came for the gold

If you tryna slide, tryna slide, I’ll put you in your place
And if you tryna ride, tryna ride.. let’s do it in a wraith
And I’m just tryna vibe, catch me while cruising in your state
I maneuver with the paper and I put it in a safe

Henessy to numb the pain
I don’t speak it’s hard to say
What I feel, I rather don’t
But the music does explain
I’m just chasing what I know
But this dream is hard to chase
Gotta pray for all my folks
Getting closer to proving em right
This shit is for you to decide
Just asking do you wanna fly
We shoot for the sky
Not tryna do suit and a tie
You see what I do with a mic
Let’s move it aside
Rather be making the dough
So I gotta stay on the low
Ain’t taking it slow
I never have faith in these hoes
Just know that I came for the gold
