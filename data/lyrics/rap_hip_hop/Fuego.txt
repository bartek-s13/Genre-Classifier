Let me start off by introducing myself
My name is Bebo from the station all I want is the wealth
I'm going crazy money making trying to better myself, but all these drugs in my system probably bad for my health
Cause when I'm sober I don't even think I fuck with myself
But these dutches and these fours really keeping me up
The emotions I ain't showing really fucking me up
But I tell myself it's whatever and I go chase a buck

I got The fuego up in the pot, and you know it's about to drop
Fiends calling up on the spot
Only call if you gonna shop
What you need bitch I got that soft and I got that Rock
Because if I catch you chatting some bodies about to drop
The station is full of snitches so watch out because it's hot
So that's why I keep the Glock, these niggas don't know the spot
As soon I get to bussin the birdies begin to flock
And bitch I aim for the top
And no I ain't gonna stop
Until I see blood
Or until I see the fucking cops
My niggas are fucking Starving
So they know what we about
It's all about stunting
So that's why I take the paper route
We just want dinero nigga there's nothing to argue bout
I'm talking the big amounts
The Escobar Chapo clout
The shit that'll make them bounce
Four commas in bank accounts
A mansion man fuck a house
Chase shit that you dream about
You only got one life
So you better make it count

Dead in the station I'm money making
The money's rolling in but it don't stop the contemplating
Rolling up the woods four grams and I'm smoking facies
Keep my shit together never let these niggas phase me
I'm going crazy
I got the fuego you know where I'm at
Motherfuckers wanna talk shit
They gonna get clapped
You know my Niggas fucking out here and we serving the pack
And your shit is wack
Put that shit in the trash
I can't fuck with no peon please step out of the trap
And make sure to tell your people to hit up my jack
Let them know that the nigga Pablo is back
And I ain't talking Kanye when I speak about that
Taking bout the ye make it snow on they ass
Even in the summer when the shootouts is bad
Rip to all my niggas that got caught up in that
Roll me up a couple blunt to remember the past
Its the goods times that last, all the motherfucking laughs
Starting pushing gas now we flipping the stacks
I got fuego muhfuckas what you think about that
Imma make to the top and I ain't looking back
