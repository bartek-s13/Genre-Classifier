<<<<<<< HEAD
Pack my snapbacks, customs
I.D. like Nike
Airport, no airline
Private flight
Ditch that PlayStation 3
Ordered the 4 with my iPhone 5
Jordans 7, 357 we fly

Jeans swinging and watch, women are sweet
Brain whizzing, the boss getting a bleep
Take a flight to the land of the Greek
International, rolling with the team
A few of us wanna get into a one dance
Thought you saw the whole clique, that was one half
Light the sky blue, let the sun glass
I use my passport like a bus pass

Here we go
We're on our way
No more looking down
We're flying away

Like a bus pass, like a bus pass
Use my passport like a bus pass
That's right, I use my passport like a bus pass
Light the sky blue, let the sun glass
I use my passport like a bus pass


Feel so free, put a couple bags down, gotta get that P
Cuh we don't higher, we're only on that higher purchase flow
Out of court, not yet yet appealing
When we touch down, heads up, ceiling
All you see are stars
Ayia Napa, yes we are
From bus pass to top class
Your boy made that bypass
Come a long way since surgery, and the blurry American academy
Never had faith, but I made the leap
Now we live life like make-believe
Went from DJ to producer-MC
