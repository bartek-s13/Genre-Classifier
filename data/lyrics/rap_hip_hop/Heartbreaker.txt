We all know that beautiful
Living life in a cubical
Keep her eyes on them cubics tho
And if money sing
She sing a musical
Like La la la la la la
(La la)
Married to a baller
All she see is signs
The dope dope dope dollars
No creflo
But was left low
Then jump up on that high life
No time for the birds that fly life
Paper planes & them skylights
Just to get her mind right
Cuz he don't care what her mind like
Cuz she fine right?
But ain't fine right?
He just care that her mind right
All he see is her tracks
Blinded by her highlights
So she give him her back
And he just see her behind nice
He always look at her chest, but ain't see her heart turn Klondik
That's ice cold
And life's road
Got a fork in it
He was fortunate
To have a seed
She aborted it
Her side peace she got board with it
Her new wave is divorcing it
No prenub she got all of it
Can't get sniff she go more to get
Left homie burning
He scorching it
Now that's magic between her fingers
No Tarot's
But he wrapped all around them that's carrots
Bling

WE ALL KNOW THAT SHE BEAUTY
OH SHE BEAUTIFUL
WE ALL KNOW THAT SHE BEAUTY
YES SHE BEAUTIFUL
WE ALL KNOW THAT SHE BEAUTY
OH SHE BEAUTIFUL
WE ALL KNOW THAT SHE BEAUTY
YES SHE BEAUTIFUL
IF YOUR HEART STOP BEATING WHERE THE MUSIC GO? AND IF MONEY SING SHE SING A MUSICAL ( Repeat 2X)

HEARTBREAKER
SHE'S A HEARTBREAKER
SHE'S A HEART BREAKER
( Repeat 2X)

Innocence immersed in her beauty
Is so dangerous
Emotions are pain resistant
Reflecting her intentions
You can see it in her eyes
When she programs her mind
Love like your Devine
As she's planning your demise
Please know (No)!
Please know (No)!
Please Know your place
She's out in space
Contemplating on who to she her grace
Her peace signs are designed
To mean escape
From contradicting friends and lovers who never stay
Immortality to feeling what she wish she felt love cannot help
Thunder on to mountaintop and advalanche
In her soul!
Every thing is everything
She don't settle for wedding rings
She deserves the galaxy to balance all of her energy
