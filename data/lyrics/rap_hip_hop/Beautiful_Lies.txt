Feel Less Club what the fuck goin' on?
(Her beautiful lies make me a fan though)

Baby want me back she got a new man
She hit on my line she with a new friend
Telling me about her heart it's broken
But I don’t give a shit about that old bitch

Yeah, Imma whip a new Benz, with two bands
Hundred fifty girls all be talking in my DM’s
Asking, “can I get a stack of bands man?” (cash cash)
She a gold digger she gon’ spend them (yea she gone spend them)

Hoping that she’s not a brand hoe (brand hoe)
Posting with her newest mans though (her mans tho)
Sick boy really got no chance though (chance tho)
Her beautiful lies make me a fan though (fan tho)
Yeah everyday I’m cruising, skirtin, whipping in the free ride
She gave me her heart but she could never ever keep mine
Maybe she could see I’m not no free guy (free guy)
Don’t you come around we'll break your heart on the east side
Fade away, all of this money won't fade away
Make a way, promise  I’m finna go make a way
Day to day, she playing ya boy from day to day
Day to day, she playing ya boy from day to day
Imma keep it real I won't let it slide (let it slide)
Baby girl I wish you wouldn’t hit my line (hit my line)

Treat you like a queen but you go kick it with them other guys

High maintenance, you was entertainment (entertainment)

Got one or two more streets to hit you alone just just beatin' it

Don’t fuck with you, you crazy bitch
Yea yea you try and text me like come on over

Gucci the coat, had to fuck a bitch right in her throat
Diamonds glisten when I bang out the pole
VVS got my neck so cold bitch, yea
Look at my neck, look at my neck, now the bitch gettin' wet yuh
Cookin' birdies like it's WingStop
Got a new foreign had to drop the top
Rollin' backwoods on the back road with the Fendi eyes on my new coat
Like the Aztecs gone cut throat coming first place never next hoe
Hold up, got them Yeezys on my feet
Ain't no need to check the season I stay ballin' like the heat
So much money coming my way like my fans at meet and greets
I just say what's on my mind like when Donald Trump tweets, hold up
