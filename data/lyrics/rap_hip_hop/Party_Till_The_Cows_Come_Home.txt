Kick out the windows bust down the doors
We're drinkin' half gallons and shoutin' for more
Take off your shoes and let yourself go
We're never gonna let these good times go
We're gonna boogie till the rooster crows
We're gonna party till the cows come home
Let it roll ... Well, let it roll...
We got all the chicken and ribs you can eat
We got good time music and dancin' feet
We're gonna turn up the music as loud as we please
We'll be so high we can hardly see
We're gonna boogie till the rooster crows
We're gonna party till the cows come home
Let it roll ... Ah, let it roll...
Kick out the windows bust down the doors
We're drinking half gallons like never before
You gotta take off your shoes Mama let yourself go
Tonight we're gonna let these good times roll
We're gonna boogie till the rooster crows
We're gonna party till the cows come home
Let it roll ... Well, let it roll ... Let it roll... Let it roll...
