We the same kids that they said "they wouldn't be shit"
Diamonds on my wrist I got 'em seasick I'm ballin'
Tell 'em we ain't broke no more
We don't wish no more
We don't trip no more
We the same kids that they said "they wouldn't be shit"
Diamonds on my wrist I got 'em seasick I'm ballin'
Tell 'em we ain't broke no more
We don't wish no more
We don't trip no more

I always knew that I'd be upon the screens
But everybody around would tell me that just a dream
So damn broke couldn't afford a pair of jeans
Had to make a couple sacrifices with the team
See we had to find a way
Oh yeah we had to find a way
I told my momma ima leave
And Then we moved out to L.A
Yeah we barely had a place to stay
We was crashing on the hills
Only visualizing we was living out there for real
Damn to making it happen without even giving a reason
Some people make it far some people won't give you a season
But see I meant for ever
As if forever last
Now take a minute with me
Now here's an hour glass
I'm living my life like with the crew
Awe no this ain't nothing new
Come check out the view
Feeling good feeling great
Oh nah I'm never low
Tell myself to a boss
Ima fucking see you ey

They can never say we never did it
Who gon tell me Now the sky's the limit
If I say I want it ima get it

We the same kids that they said "they wouldn't be shit"
Diamonds on my wrist I got 'em seasick I'm ballin'
Tell 'em we ain't broke no more
We don't wish no more
We don't trip no more
We the same kids that they said "they wouldn't be shit"
Diamonds on my wrist I got 'em seasick I'm ballin'
Tell 'em we ain't broke no more
We don't wish no more
We don't trip no more
Got money on my mind
I was grinding I was putting in overtime
Thought I wasn't going nowhere I ain't lyin'
I ain't lying lying lying
They said Venci where you tryna go I said 
They can never use my time
I used to wake up everyday at 5
Now I pay myself what's a 9 to 5
I ain't switch lane I stay with the same friends
We used to be broke we used to rock the same chains
Now we at the jeweler every time we feel plain
Are we celebrating spreading all the champagne
I don't need fake energy around me
Got my momma straight she living care free
Never ask no one for favours cause that ain't me
Gotta do it for yourself cause nothing comes free
Cause nothing comes free

We the same kids that they said "they wouldn't be shit"
Diamonds on my wrist I got 'em seasick I'm ballin'
Tell 'em we ain't broke no more
We don't wish no more
We don't trip no more
