Oh, how you feelin' right now
You know you can tell me if you're feelin' kinda down
Put away the drugs, I promise I can be around
To help you find your problems baby, we'll figure it out
And I know
If you love me you'll say so
I don't wanna let you go
Through the sun, rain and the snow
All these feelings, I can't hold

Nowadays I be feelin' faded
Pour up a couple drinks, now I'm feelin' wasted
If you know me then you know I take it
Yeah, I'm going for my dreams, know I always chase it
If you're feeling all alone
I don't wanna be here, and she knows
You can call up on my phone
She can never see clear, I guess so

How you feelin' right now
You know you can tell me if you're feelin' kinda down
Put away the drugs, I promise I can be around
To help you find your problems baby, we'll figure it out
And I know
If you love me you'll say so
I don't wanna let you go
Through the sun, rain and the snow
All these feelings, I can't hold
How you feelin' right now, yeah, yeah
If you're feelin' kinda down, down
We can fight your problems, baby
We will figure out, know that I will never save me
She will never save me
Yeah
