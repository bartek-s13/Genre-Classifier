Loud all in the mail, got it shipped out from Cali' though
Need me a new scale making moves like a rally horse
Rolling down the windows, blowing smoke with my Valley whore
Look inside my cup, ask my drink what'd it smack me for?
We got all the product fuck boy, what you asking for?
And I never tell, even if it's the last resort
Addicted to lean, every hour we pass a four
She got a crush on Stizz, best believe I'mma smash it though
But

Tattoos on her body, I got her dressed in Gianni
Nighttime sloppy top, in the morning she bust Pilates
Rocks all in the socks back then when I was on the trolley
Trying to push Ferraris, and move up to Bugattis
You ain't gotta ask cause you know my section rowdy
I ain't gotta blast cause you know my hood around me
Running from the past, man I know that shit got cloudy
Cash all in the stash when we load, duck and count it
But
