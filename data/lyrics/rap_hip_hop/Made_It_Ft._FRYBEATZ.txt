Fuck the otherside that's what we do
If you wanna switch sides then nigga leave the fucking room ay
Nature le Redeemer Imma fucking boss
Got my gang gang by my side ain't ever take a loss ay
All you haters say we ain't gonna make it
Nigga catch a wake up and look we already made it ay
I don't need your love to make mama proud
See the tears of her joy I already made her fucking proud ay
Nature le Redeemer ay

Catch a wake up
You done need it
Fuck your doubt shit
We don't need it
Got my gang gang
We done made it
Gotta go home
Turn off my phone
Write some songs
Right my wrongs
Said it all before I'm tired of people switching sides
Done with all the fake, I had to leave them all behind
Feel like life is short and I don't want to waste my time
Yes we said "I love you", difference is I never lied
Been through all the pain and look I've seen my mama cry
But I told her "mama smile, the pain will pass just give it time"
Now I think about it, shit was crae, I was only five
So to all the fakes just get the fuck out of my life
They trynna talk down on my name mama, mama
People always hate mama
Its just what happens when they see me doing great mama
I still always kill it coz I didn't come to play mama

This that new shit
Fuck that old shit
Catch a wake up
You done need it
Fuck your doubt shit
We don't need it
Got my gang gang
We done made it
