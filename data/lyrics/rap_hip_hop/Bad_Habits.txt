They say talk about your problems
Okay, where do I begin?
Lately I've been chilling
And sipping on a few Heinekens
Wishing I could kill myself
Revive and then just die again
I'm looking at the stars
And thinking I wish I could fly with them
Grab a swisher, tuck and roll
Huff it in my lungs and nose
Keep on puffing up the smoke
And watch as all my problems blow
To the winners
They get scattered like the ashes
I've been tripping over bitches
Like I'm tripping off some acid
I gotta keep it passive
Hit the blunt and then I pass it
Wishing I could grip the pen
And slay my problems like a dragon
Demons been demanding
This depression got me manic
Keep puffing the herbs
Until I'm lost just like Atlantis
I don't really sleep much
Cause my nights are filled with panic
Lay me down inside the grave
I can no longer stand this
Life is like a card game
And I hate what I've been dealt
So fuck all my emotions
I'ma place them all on a shelf

I know I need to quit these drugs
And I will eventually
And when I do I just hope
You don't hold this shit against me
Even when I'm feeling fine
I know this shit could tempt me
I just learned to turn to you
When I was feeling empty
And every time I do it
I feel suicidal
I never thought I had a problem
Till they killed my idols
I'm just trying to stay sober
But it's been awhile
And you can see my dirty habits
And a yellow smile
I ain't ever go out
Cause I ain't in the mood
I just roll another blunt
And try to hide up in my room
I'm just trapped in this cocoon
Penning my incoming doom
And I always feel depressed
So I'll just sing another tune
Woah
I pack my bags, I'm saying Adios
I'm never seeking help
Cause I ain't ready for that diagnose
Woah
Eyes closed slowed
That's comatose
And it runs in my family
