Yeah
Know what I'm sayin', Soldier Life, you hear me
Free my nigga Soldier
Never forget loyalty and that's on gang
On my mama nigga we with that shit
2018 our motherfuckin' year, you know what I'm sayin'
I'm comin' harder than motherfuckin' ever
Soldier Life, get with it or get left, again

Finessing the city with Wodey and BG, we turning shit up like a TV
I hit that lil bitch from the back and the side, once I hit from the front that's a threepeat
I just hit that lil bitch with no rubber, I'll nut on her covers and tell her it's over
As soon as I'm back in her city she callin' my phone, tryna fuck on the sofa
Remember when shit had got ugly, I ran up some money and handled the pressure
I wish I could be with Big Sosa, just give me a pen, I'ma send him a letter
You said you need what? we gon' handle that shit so I told him to make a deposit
I pray for these niggas that's plottin' on me 'cause I sleep with the fire in the closet
Dawg I'm smoking one hell of a blunt with a beautiful bitch on a beautiful day
Every time that I step in the 'yo I'ma cook tat shit up, have 'em callin' me Quay
These niggas be cappin' 'bout this and that, it ain't no pressure, I'm keeping my cool
I just walked in this bitch with a pistol on me but I treat that bitch more like a tool
I know that I'm next in my city but I cannot fold, I'm nothing like a taco
That bitch wanna fuck with my team so I nut on her butt and pass her to my vato
He preaching that G shit
When I see him I'm at him, just know that I'm clapping
When I see him it's over, I'ma pull out the stick like I'm looking for wabbits
I'm fucking this bitch in the back of the trap house, I ate the pussy, made her tap out
Don't pass me that shit, this gelato, I'm fucking a freak in the back of a Tahoe
Lil bitch he workin' with the sack and he off in trap, he sleepin' with a bundle
I'm tryna fuck her and her friend from the back, while I'm pullin', thinkin' 'bout Rapunzel
I just been fucking these bitches, smoking exquisite, keeping my composure
I just been chasing my profit, tryna keep the lean consistent with the soda
In Birmingham, shit can get wicked
This shit really come with a ticket
It's either you trap or you hustle lil nigga
You better get up and go get it
It's 'bout twenty-eight bars in the slushy
You know I ain't stupid, you know I'm just cappin'
I really just needed a hook dog
I felt like a picture that needed a caption
Tell your partner quit the capping'
These niggas really be some actors
I'm tryna take off with this rapping
If a nigga catch me, bitch I'm with the trappers

Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
