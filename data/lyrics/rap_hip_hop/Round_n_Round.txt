Shawty, she go round and round in my head
Baby, we go round for round in my bed
She the one I think I found 'till I'm dead
I don't want nobody else in my head
Shawty, she go round and round in my head
Baby, we go round for round in my bed
She the one I think I found 'till I'm dead
I don't want nobody else in my head

And no, I don't need another one that can stay up late
And have a ton of fun (Take your clothes off)
What's in my drink, it won't let me doze off
In deep rest girl, overdose on Zoloft
And I've been up all night, sweating in my dreams
I try to run away, but you're trapping me
Romance, reacted chemically
Now I climax my own way, ecstasy
I'm rollin' cookie with my gang
The same niggas never change
I'm a rockstar, addicted to the pain
Don't want her butt, I back away
So thick, I do a double take
Don't even know what's going on, in my brain, oh

And I would never change
Everybody say I'll switch, but I'll never change, yeah
I'm just switching lanes
But I'm thinking 'bout you shawty, that will never change

Shawty, she go round and round in my head
Baby, we go round for round in my bed
She the one I think I found 'till I'm dead
I don't want nobody else in my head
Shawty, she go round and round in my head
Baby, we go round for round in my bed
She the one I think I found 'till I'm dead
I don't want nobody else in my head (Aye)

Don't remind me at all, yeah
You don't gotta think about it, you always there for me, yeah, yeah
That's why you my little baby
Yeah, baby, it's a new day
And all my fucking brothers paid
All my brothers self-made, we don't need your help mane
All my fucking brothers paid
All my brothers self-made, we don't need your help mane
And I would never change
Everybody say I'll switch, but I'll never change, yeah
