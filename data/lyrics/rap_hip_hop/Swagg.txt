I can't let you be my typer, Cause I know your very hyper
He ain't takin my Swagg, Cause I know he's a Fag
We bout to make a Reformation, Cause this my nation
We take all the girls, Cause we got all the curls
If you don't got swagg, you are secretly gay
I feel sorry for your bag, Cause I was born in May

If you from the country side, I'm gonna put you in a bind
