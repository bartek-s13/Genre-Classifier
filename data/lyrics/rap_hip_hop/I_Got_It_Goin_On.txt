I got it, goin' on, I'm here to tell you
I know I'm makin' records but I'm not here to sell ya
The proof is in the pudding when I start to quote
On the stupid dope rhymes that I just wrote
When I wake up in the morn, look in the mirror
See my face, sexy brown like syrup
Goin' to the closet, and select my gear
Silver suit and tie, maybe some Fila wear
Head to the limo that's parked outside
Makin' money in the back while I'm sayin' this rhyme
Make you thought it was weak, didn't know it was strong
Hate to disappoint ya, I got it goin' on

Tone Loc, MC of the future
Sayin' rhymes and lines guaranteed to suit ya
The author, the writer and the editor
Sucka rappers sprayin' no ads at this competitor
Not knockin' no knocks, jockin' no jocks
Sayin' precious lines to make the women all flock to
The lover, figher, a gracious host
Chillin' most, from coast to coast
Not causin' no static, I'm just a rap addict
And when I'm on the mic, all the busters panic
I told you I was def, you thought I haven't, didn't
Didn't know I was the one the crowd recommended
Rollin' like precision, it's your decision
Or if you wanna chill, kick back and listen
I'm not tellin' no stories, or singin' no song
But in case you forgot, I got it goin' on
I make ice melt, and water freeze
I'm the baddest mother (uh!) on the seven seas
Like a wizard in a blizzard, I preform and it's warm
In a hurricane, and earthquake and thunderstorm
Not mistakin' or fakin', I'm right up front
And if you see it ain't peakin', I'm the one you want
Always chill, nothing less than spectacular
Loc's on the mic with vivacious vernacular
Servin' and curvin' all the ones in my way
Yeah lippin' and pimpin', 'cause I live in L.A
Sunny Cal, that's where the players chill
But no need to talk, 'cause you know the deal
Turn up the volume on the speaker
'Cause my rhymes are gettin' stronger
As the others are gettin' weaker
Hell yeah I'm right, I could never be wrong
And in case you forgot, I got it goin' on

We gon keep on rockin' straight to the end
So won't you be like Alpha-Beta, and tell a friend
Under any circumstances, I rock all your pants's
Make girlies hot, like Harlequin Romance
Make the stuff I'm out, in the middle of night
So I can have a little longer just to rock the mic
You know the party don't stop 'til the Tone arive
Because the set is there, and Loc is so live
The truth is what I'm tellin' you, you best believe it
I'm convinced, and already can see it
Just kill, get stupid, let the beat commence
Stampede like the raiders, exceed with excellence
'Cause I'm the hip hop king, when I'm doing my thing
Known as the player, but it ain't no thing
I got face outside, so Imma say so long
I hate to disappoint ya, I got it goin' on
For real, you know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah
Giz-ah, giz-oh, giz-oo
But first, M1
Tell 'em the flavor, please?
Cut it up!
