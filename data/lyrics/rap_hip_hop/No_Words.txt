I don't wanna dead no
I don't wanna sort it
I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't wanna

I don't wanna dead no beef
I don't wanna sort it out
I don't wanna hear no words
I don't wanna talk it out
I don't wanna dead no beef
I don't wanna sort it out
I don't wanna hear no words
I don't wanna talk it out

I don't wanna talk 'bout the ins and outs
But in my bank, more money goes in than out
So I had to 'llow the paigon, allow the baiting
If I touch you, I'll bet you my house gets raided
I'm with some dumb youts that'll blaze for cussing
Don't raise their yout but they will raise the suttin'
And I like my car with the roof off
I like my girl in Louboutin
But sometimes I'm with the duttiest girls
'Cause those are the easy ones
But too bad they only see me once
'Cause we one night them
I wonder why we don't like them
All this money I spend, 'cause I...
I don't wanna dead no beef
I don't wanna sort it out
I don't wanna hear no words
I don't wanna talk it out
I don't wanna dead no beef
I don't wanna sort it out
I don't wanna hear no words

Cause I'm, self made, self paid
Girls wanna phone for a friend
Over and over again
Over and over and over again
Self made, self paid
Girls wanna phone for a friend
Over and over again
Over and over and over again

Not again, oh my days
Another girl with her sly ways
And why is this girl moving sideways?
Every time my iPhone ping, she's looking at it sideways
I need a gyal that rubs back and gives massages
Not a gyal that backchats and sends messages
Saying she hates me then loves me
Says "fuck you", then fucks me
Yo, walk in a party, standard
Where's your army? Where's your mandem?
On Insta, sitting in a mad whip
In traffic, man are looking like a catfish
Fake youts, plastic
Stop acting, man are all average
My girl got a body boombastic
Elastic, call her Mrs Fantastic

Like ooh, pull up in a car, I cruise
Hopped out cool, nice move
Why she wanna know? When I said I'm with a star
She just turned around and she said "who?"
Took her home with us, that's standard
She wanna roll with us, that's standard
Niggas getting paid, that's standard
This Mo and Dave, that's bangers

I don't wanna dead no beef
I don't wanna sort it out
I don't wanna hear no words
I don't wanna talk it out
I don't wanna dead no beef
I don't wanna sort it out
I don't wanna hear no words
I don't wanna talk it out
