<<<<<<< HEAD
From where I'm sat
I’ll earn some diamond rings and plaques
For when I'm sad
I turn my head and I cling to that
Bet it comes right back what I would have had
If I never gave any to you
Who'da known I was full the whole time like the moon (Ooh)

From where I’m sat
The moon looks likes dew in the grass
But your eyes are huge, can you tell if I'm doing bad?
Mother Earth, I been burnin' all this gas
Swipin' this plastic and driving too fast
Flying so probably buyin' in excess
But been paper baggin' and totin' no less
Brought me up to the stars, it was worth it we figured, but baby
What's a deep breath if the air isn’t fresh?

Gotta clear it why you always so mysterious
I moved fast and you were furious
I was Mia, you were Brian, ain’t a cop but you were lyin'
I was massive, you were giant
All the other lights were silent
Only two left in the sky we starting intertwining, spinning
Black hole tunnel vision, but from where I’m sitting now
Helping out light the sky up
Seems like my only way up
Helping out is only what's right
Baby you were up all night
Swipin' this plastic and driving too fast
Flying so probably buyin' in excess
But paper baggin’ and toting no less

Your body carbon but not copied
Your body cosmically corralled me
Like gravity you keep on working on me
Like gravity you keep on working on me

From where I'm sat
Turning the wheel to come back
Feeling my tires all shaking in need of alignment and changing my brakes but I'll make it
Barely breathing you might wanna save it
Sitting where you stood
Before you turned the pages in our book
The shade dissipated, now I'm waiting here to cook
The waste we created need a way to make it good
Your face emaciated I would feed you if I could

All of the space we don't leave
Filled with the things we don't need
All that we built, all of the land that we filled
Swallowed this planets like pills
Baby you were up all night
Swipin' this plastic and driving too fast
Flying so probably buyin' in excess
But paper baggin' and toting no less

Your body carbon but not copied
Your body cosmically corralled me
Like gravity you keep on working on me
Like gravity you keep on working on me
Like helium, lightheaded delirium

Like packs and pounds, you keep on breaking me down
