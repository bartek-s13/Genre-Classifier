I wake up and count my
I wake up and count my

I wake up and count my blessings, never stressing
I wake up I pray to God lead me in the right direction
Yeah, wake up I count my
Blessings, never stressing
I wake up I pray to God hoping that he get my message, yeah
I've been on the low, low, low
I do not know, know, know
Just what I want, want, want
So got me Lord, Lord, Lord
I’ve been on the low, low, low
I do not know, know, know
Just what I want, want, want
So got me Lord, Lord, Lord

No one ever saw the vision
Told me I was too young
Too calm in this game
But I envisaged something different
Yeah they turned me down
Told me I was tripping
Now we planning trips
And plotting on the mission
And because of my age, man there's been division
They say pave the way, man that's my decision
Never been forced
Honestly its sickenin’
Now they making claims (They making claims)
Man that's so insane
Talking about I changed
But I've been this way
They said your dream's too big
Now take a look at what I did
About to take over the game
No questions boy, that's it

I wake up and count my blessings, never stressing
Every night I pray to God lead me in the right direction
Yeah, wake up and count my
Blessings, never stressing
I wake up I pray to God hoping that he get my message, yeah
I been on the low, low, low
I do not know, know, know
Just what I want, want, want
So got me Lord, Lord, Lord
I been on the low, low, low
I do not know, know, know
Just what I want, want, want
So got me Lord, Lord, Lord

I know they hatin'
I pay them no attention
They trying to imitate me
But I should probably mention
There's only one little kid
Couldn't care less about what you did
Or what you doing honestly
Too concentrated on my biz
I don’t got time for their games
Don’t pay no mind to these lames
I'm in my own separate lane
I mean I’m just saying
I'm gonna put in honest work
I've seen how far I can get
See all the hate it don't work
We got the platinum on set

I wake up and count my blessings, never stressing
Every night I pray to God lead me in the right direction
Yeah, wake up and count my
Blessings, never stressing
I wake up I pray to God hoping that he get my message, yeah
I been on the low, low, low
I do not know, know, know
Just what I want, want, want
So got me Lord, Lord, Lord
I been on the low, low, low
I do not know, know, know
Just what I want, want, want
