(I did it all on my own) 
(I did it all on my own)
(Hi it’s me, leave a message)
(I did it all)
Okay, uh
I know you fed up
And you can do it all on your own 
Don’t need a nigga
Its good to have a mind of your own
So keep your head up
And you can do it all on your own 
Don’t need a nigga
I know you wonder
When a nigga thinking with his head
And when he goin under
And he ask to keep it under wraps, 
Like shit is undercover 
Don’t know what you waiting for
You should be impatient more
If I can take the time to make you smile
Then you should call me back 
If you were mine, then I’d show you around 
There’s nothing wrong with that 
Don’t know why you holding on
Love is like overdose 
And every time your on my mind
It’s almost like I’ve seen the Holy Ghost
Bad little vibe, you should be up in the poconos

Hit the road
And you can say you did it all on your own
Without a nigga 
You can say you did it all on your own
“I did it all on my own”
No time to play cause you grown
It’s better being alone 
I feel that I can be your man
And hold your hand, like if you want me to
And I ain’t tryna talk about ya man and what he wouldn’t do
You could come with me, I got a plan and I’ll be good to you 
You could come with me, I got a plan and I’ll be good to you
Okay
Uh 
I kinda figure
That I can pick you up from the store 
I’ll be that nigga
And when I pull up in a Rove
And They get jealous
Then I go to open the door
I’m acting petty
I know you wonder
When a nigga thinking with his head
And when he goin under
And he ask to keep it under wraps, 
Like shit is undercover 
Don’t know what you waiting for
You should be impatient more
If I can take the time to make you smile
Then you should call me back 
Hit the road
And you can say you did it all on your own
Without a nigga 
You can say you did it all on your own
“I did it all on my own”

It’s better being alone 
Okay, uh
I know you fed up
And you can do it all on your own 
Don’t need a nigga
Its good to have a mind of your own
So keep your head up
And you can do it all on your own 
Don’t need a nigga
I know you wonder
If you would be kicking it with him
If you was any younger
I’ll pick you up and we can take a swim
And you can hold me under
It’s hard for you to go out on a limb
With what he put you through 
But you could come with me, I got a plan and I’ll be good to you
Okay, uh
