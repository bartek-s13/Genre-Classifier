You think another motherfucka know what you need to do?
Ain't no purpose dog
It's money we born to fuckin' die man
In the meantime, get money
Fuck a book man

Ten cellphones bouncin back to back
Gotta get my momma out the fuckin' trap
Ten cellphones bouncin back to back
Whippin up that chicken had a heart attack
Ten cellphones bouncin back to back
Lost ten packs gotta get 'em back
Ten cellphones bouncin' back to back
Finessin out the trap, finessin out the trap

Ten cellphones bouncin back to back
I get it out the trap i get it out the trap
First time havin' sex I used Saran Wrap
Just a young nigga that didn't give a crap
And if I see her I- I promise I'm gon' tap
Put em on the map I put em on the map
I smoke a mid blunt and then I take a nap
Forty rounds on (?)
Tap, tap, tap


Ten cellphones and they all jumpin
Talk crazy, big homies they gon' get you bumpin
Man these bitches, yeah I swear, I can't never trust 'em
It's a dirty world so finesse in this life
Pray on the days on my gang they gon get (?)
Young, Young nigga and I used the push to pack
Had to level up
Had to get my juggs
Had to take a cap

Ten cellphones and they all jumpin
Trap line doin' fuckin' numbers
And shit shootin up like Steph Curry
