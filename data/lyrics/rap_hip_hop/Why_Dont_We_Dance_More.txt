Feel it in your soul
Why don't we dance?
Why don't we dance more?

Why don't we dance more?
Why don't we dance more?
Why don't we dance more?

It's in your mind
Let go of pressure
The world puts on you
Feel the music in your body and soul
Let it take control

Why don't we dance more?
Why don't we dance more?
Why don't we dance more?
Why don't we dance more?
Why don't we dance more?

You can't deny it
Starting to move
When you hear that groove
Feel the music in your body and soul
Let it take control

Why don't we dance more?
Why don't we dance more?
Why don't we dance more?
Why don't we dance more?
Why don't we dance more?

Whatever the time and place
Nothing's going tense in space
So if you're stressed and in doubt
Come on, let that shit out
Come on, let that shit out

Why don't we dance more?
(Why don't we dance more?)
(Why don't we dance more?)
Why don't we dance more?
(Why don't we dance more?)
(Why don't we dance more?)
Why don't we (come on) dance more
Why don't we dance more?
(Why don't we dance more?)
(Why don't we dance?)
(Come on, let's dance)
