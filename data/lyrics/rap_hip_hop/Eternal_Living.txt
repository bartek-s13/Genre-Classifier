Mommy, India got them beats

Where I'm from, they ain't have hope, they call us ignorant
I looked at my drip, this that expensive shit
He mad at me about a ho, I should've hit the bitch
They throwin' shots, we never catch 'em, they be quick to miss
I'm from the slums, I ain't never had a pot to piss
They gave us crumbs, how the fuck to make it out this shit?
We ain't have nothin', now a nigga havin' lots of shit
And I still got niggas in the trap scrapin' pots and shit
I finally won, they wanna know how I'm shinin' like that
'Cause I'm due for it, remember I was grindin' way back
Now I pull up in the uh, with the seat laid back
Now we pull up and just boom, leave a nigga where he at
Remember where we was, now nigga, look where we at
Remember we was sellin' drugs, now we ain't ever goin' back
Now everybody showin' love, but they wasn't showin' it in the past
Might take a rocket outer space just so the world can kiss my ass

And I can't change how I'm living
I ain't got no feelings
I pour drank in my kidney
And it's only for the healing
Why you come around? You ain't with me
Why you come around if you gon' envy?
I just count the blessings that he sent me
I just pray to God they don't forget me

That lifestyle stuck in my head, I ain't changing my ways
Out there posted on the corner, I ain't ate for some days
I'm tired of runnin' from police, I'm just tryna get paid
And it's fuck the other side 'cause that's how we were raised
Summertime, we bring them drums out, like a parade
Left the AR in the trunk, it's time to slide with them K's
You better duck 'cause it's a drill once that chopper get sprayed
Ain't no remorse 'cause I got niggas layin' down in the grave
So fuck a sport, we hit the block and then them cops what we play
Runnin' out of options so I close my eyes and I pray
Just tryna find the best route, feel like I'm stuck in a maze
I started rappin', got a check, and fell in love with the stage

And I can't change how I'm living
I ain't got no feelings
I pour drank in my kidney
And it's only for the healing
Why you come around? You ain't with me
Why you come around if you gon' envy?
I just count the blessings that he sent me
I just pray to God they don't forget me

I just pray to God that he forgive me
I did so much wrong, they want to kill me
I got niggas in them trenches, they gon' drill for me
But if they all die for me, who gon' live with me?
I got all this money, the wanna chill with me
But we was stuck on Evergreen, they ain't want to deal with me
Now I pull up coupe shit, 2019, new shit
New phone, who this? Pocket full of blue shit
Pocket full of blue strips, no Crip
One shot to a hit, that bitch came off the hip
Brand new truck, that bitch came off the ship
I let you 'round and you changed off the rip, nigga I

And I can't change how I'm living
I ain't got no feelings
I pour drank in my kidney
And it's only for the healing
Why you come around? You ain't with me
Why you come around if you gon' envy?
I just count the blessings that he sent me
I just pray to God they don't forget me

I just pray to God they don't forget me
