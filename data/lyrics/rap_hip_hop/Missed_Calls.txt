Tell me why I'm waiting for someone
That couldn't give a fuck about me
Oh, oh you wouldn't...
Tell me why I'm waiting for someone
That couldn't give a fuck about me
Oh, oh you wouldn't...
Tell me why I'm waiting for someone
That couldn't give a fuck about me
Oh, oh you wouldn't...

I see them tear drops fall
Hearts broke open I just wanna end it all
Cut marks on her wrist signifies our fall
Noose tied around my neck hear the drugs call
She a bad little bitch and she want it all
Passed out on the floor from the alcohol
I didn't wanna tear her down cuz she stand tall
Cryin' lookin' through my phone for her missed calls

Tell me why I'm waiting for someone
That couldn't give a fuck about me
Oh, oh you wouldn't...
