Brigades
Violence and swervings (Oh, AV, you're taking the piss, una?)
Lean out—lean out the ride and burst him
Of course I’m rolling, don't ask me twice if I'll burn him (Gotcha bitch)
Charged up like Duracell batts, fling corn in a fuckboy’s hat
How many man should be dead? On my life, it's getting me mad
On my l—on my life it's getting me mad
Violence and swervings, lean out—lean out the ride and burst him
Of course I'm rolling, don't ask me twice if I'll burn him

If I said it, I fucking meant it, lean out the ride, all lock and kweff it (Bow)
I been 'round here tryna whack man's head in, I beg you don’t slip, don’t leave your best friend (Ay, come here!)
Call my young boy go der with the force, how many man been chinged on volts? (Ching, ching)
Meet K in the wagon, ye' ain’t making it home, swing them shanks, come crippled mine
Just ask—, they'll remember that night (They do), V9 too devilish, true say I wanna take man's life
And, I beg you don't talk that wass (Don’t)
I really pull up and crash outside (Mhm-mhm)
I heard I got-got by a opp, but I was at gaff, doin' up Netflix (Them dickheads)
'Dem man love lie on my name, cah they wanna be on UDN
But if they mentioned me, they'd be whacked, or chased
And that's facts (Woi-oi)
Ain't got no courage, them man just cowardly dogs (Some dickheads)
Every time they buck Bankai, 'dem man pull up their pants, say bye (Skeet)
I'm fucking schitz', take out my shank, let's see who gets hit (Splash!)
Two man like Kane and Lynch, opp block said man's taking trips (Man's touring)
Some man are my friend from young, but can hold these slugs for fun (Bow)
I'm still blacked-out like Batman, long samurai, tryna pierce man's lung (Ching, ching)
Two hands on a final flash, hear a big bang, just like Vegeta (Bow)
I don't follow the law, man know I'm a fucking deviant
Man just pull up on opps and see man run, fucking idiots (Ay come here!)
Run a—run a man down and stab you, I wanna see blood pour out this idiot
I wanna see blood pour out this idiot (Ching, ching)

Violence and swervings, lean out the ride and burst him (Bow!)
Of course, I'm rolling, don't ask me twice if I'll burn him (Don't do it)
Charged up like Duracell batts, fling corn in a fuckboy's hat (Bow-bow)
How many men should be dead? On my life, it's gettin' me mad (Confusion)

Bro–bro said it already, talk on the 9, better talk with respect (Respect it)
Swing them shanks like Link (Splash)
Bust doors, watch she-men sprint (Ay, come here!)
Legwork be amazing, cah the man don't panic and trip (How?)
Shoulda stabbed like half of their guys
They give verbal, they run for their lives (Some dickheads)
This ain't no game of Run Outs, I beg you be easy and cool (Be easy)
Come, come taste this Sammi', 'cause you know it's craving you
(Ay, come here!)
Lost my man, we done lost YB, they ain't on shit, it's getting me pissed
One month, stretched you up, 'dem man run before seeing the thing (Some pussies)
And, lucky this burner jammed, he woulda got shot right through his plaits (V9)
Anywhere gang, man I don't give a toss, ***** tryna ching man's top (Ching, ching, ching)
Civilians best not move (Don't do it), don't make me overuse my lung (Stay there)
Put their hands in the air and scream, "Sensei", so I know wagwan
All this talk 'bout smoke, what gun have you fucking got?
(What gun?)
Your olders run with waps (Some dickheads), your young Gs stay shooting blanks
Man pull up with the shh, crash, khalas, the 'ting go bang (Bang)
I ain't giving a warning, man just hop out the car and bore him (Ching, ching, ching)
Talking, you're just foreign, Venomous bop from night to the mornin'
Bring the dotty up close and burst him, mazza on a glide, that's a guaranteed purging (Man string 'im)
ST just bang the 'ting and just earth him (Bow, bow!)
(Bang the—bang the 'ting and just—)
ST, just bang the 'ting and just earth him

Violence and swervings, lean out the ride and burst him (Bow!)
Of course, I'm rolling, don't ask me twice if I'll burn him (Don't do it)
