Don't do it to me, don't do it to me, oh no no, oh no no
Don't do it to me, oh no no, oh no no
Don't do it to me, oh no no, oh no no
Don't do it to me, oh no no, oh no no

Focused, I'm focused
She got a body like that, I ain't never seen nothing like that
Like a fantasy in front of me
I think that something special is going down
That's right I think she foreign, I think she foreign
Got passports, mi amor started slow, got faster
She gon' work some more, work some more
No stopping her now, no stopping her now

Then she started dancing, sexual romancing
Nasty but she fancy, lipstick on my satin sheets
What's your nationality? I wonder if there's more of you
She's got my attention, she's confident

Oh no no, oh no no, she's confident
Oh no no, oh no no and I'm down with it
Oh no no, oh no no, she's confident
You could tell by the way she walks in the room
She said it's her first time (oh, yeah, yeah)
I think she might have lied
Feels so good damn (oh, yeah, yeah)
And I don't know why
I'm addicted (oh, yeah, yeah)
Something like an addict
Got me twisted (oh, yeah, yeah)
But still I gotta have it

Explosive, explosive
I could still smell her perfume
It's not hard to notice, that I'm open
Hypnotised by the way she moves

Then she started dancing, sexual romancing
Nasty but she fancy, Mona Lisa masterpiece
What's your nationality? I wonder if there's more of you
She's got my attention, she's confident

Oh no no, oh no no, she's confident
Oh no no, oh no no and I'm down with it
Oh no no, oh no no, she's confident
You could tell by the way she walks in the room
She said it's her first time (oh, yeah, yeah)
I think she might have lied
Feels so good damn (oh, yeah, yeah)
And I don't know why (IGH!)
I'm addicted (oh, yeah, yeah)
Something like an addict (Ooh-woo!)
Got me twisted (oh, yeah, yeah)
But still I gotta have it
Chance? The Rapper? IGH!

Tattoos, piercings and she just learned to twerk (oh?)
She ain't got a heart or a ass, just her brains
Gotta ask cause her ass on a learning curve (oh?)
And she love to hurn the berb, I mean burn the word
That's only legal with a doctor's note (oh?)
Real deep pockets like a doctor's coat (IGH! IGH!)
Stay faded like Diddy's hair, back tryna rock the vote
She the first mate when I rock the boat (IGH!)
She never forget to ride like a bicycle
She like planes, trains, chains with icicles
It goes her, blank, blank, and rock &amp; roll (IGH!)
She say "I know, honey bunny, that's the funny thing" (ooh!)
Thots twerk for the Goodfellas
She money dance with the money team, IGH!
She's confident
Oh no no, oh no no, she's confident
Oh no no, oh no no and I'm down with it
Oh no no, oh no no, she's confident
You could tell by the way she walks in the room

She said it's her first time (oh, yeah, yeah)

Feels so good damn (oh, yeah, yeah)
And I don't know why

Something like an addict
Got me twisted (oh, yeah, yeah)
But still I gotta have it

Still I gotta have it (yeah)
Still I gotta have it (alright)
Still I gotta have it (yeah, alright)
Oh no no, oh no no, oh no no (yeah)
Oh no no, oh no no, oh no no (alright)
Oh no no, oh no no, oh no no (yeah)
Oh no no, oh no no

Don't do it to me, don't do it to me, oh no no, oh no no
