Ay Turn that up Kudo

Ah when you walk through
Told bro if they change I'm still with you
Man down if they talking about an issue
I’ma show 'em
Ah ahhhh

My Wassa gon' fire when he walk through
My diamonds gon’ shine when they want to
Take him out his prime, now he old news
Gotta read the sign, don't let it play you
Told bro if they change I'm still with you
Man down if they talkin' 'bout an issue
Trap house i'ma show 'em what my wrist do
Drop one watch it turn it in two
Gotta go hard, need a whole lot
Focus on the plot, we gotta make it out
And that bitch too stout, gotta kick her out
She ain't know then and that bitch know now
We the hottest youngins out
What you niggas’ bout? They just ’bout clout
I'm on the cash route, and I’m on the cash route
I'ma ball out, i'ma ball out
Baby i'ma ball out
Baby i’ma ball out, i'ma ball out
Only gang allowed
Never fall out
Not about no amount
My niggas no clowns
Caught him outta bounds
Serve a few rounds
You know we ride around what's the issue?
My Wassa so slime need a tissue
Deep under that water see with you
They down for the ride they ain't down with you
Heard you niggas dropping dimes like loose change
407, do the dash in the blue wraith
To stay safe, he needs hoes need a luque
 might send 'em some today
Yeah you know lil' bro he on go andale
She told me don't go want me stay
Pray a call and I got get this cake
So i'm on it, the morning can wait, ah

I'ma ball out, i'ma ball out
Baby i'ma ball out
Gotta go hard, need a whole lot
Forties in the lot, killers in the yard
Do it for the team, bitch, I do it for the block
And our big dreams and the city so small
They know who we are, I don't gotta say shit
Glizzy Haitian and it's fifth generation
Bro load 'em .223's in the K clip
Pull up make a movie whole lotta entertainment
Sleeping in the trap thirty days straight
Walking out with a whole lotta cake
'Member them days 'member them days
Got bros in cuffs and bros doing raids
And she bought a brick so I fuck with her
Might fill up a bag run it up with her
And I could never be a sucker for love
Cold ice cold heart
Knew he'd change up seen it coming
Pull up on him he ain't seen nothing
Got the city hot, say we buzzing
From the dirt mud with my brothers
My niggas came up from nothing
And we ain't running from nothing
They set, blue and red
All of the drip, rather keep one in the head
Traffic, smoked one in the head
My Wassa gon' fire when he walk through
My diamonds gon' shine when they want to
Take him out his prime, now he old news
Gotta read the sign, don't let it play you
Told bro if they change I'm still with you
Man down if they talkin' 'bout an issue
Trap house i'ma show 'em what my wrist do

I'm on the cash route, and I'm on the cash route
I'ma ball out, i'ma ball out
Baby i'ma ball out
