Bad, bad, bad
Every time I wanna see you, I wanna be with you
You're bad, bad, bad
And all your friends bad too, bad too
Bad, bad, bad
Every time I wanna see you, I wanna be with you
You’re bad, bad, bad
And all your friends bad too, bad too

Girl, I fuck with you
Anything you do, anything you do I fuck with you
I'm trying on a world that's tailored for you
Bursting at the seems for you, oh
Brown skin beauty you flawless goddess
Slim thick issue, I wanna involve ya
Recluse heels, You offset my caution

Bad, bad, bad
Every-time I wanna see you, I wanna be with you
You’re bad, bad, bad
And all your friends bad too, bad too
Bad, bad, bad
Every-time I wanna see you, I wanna be with you
You're bad, bad, bad
And all your friends bad too, bad too

Run away while you can, while you can
Run away while you can

Oh She's an Apex predator, beauty like no other
Tears apart her lovers
Being that I'm peaking, thought I'd stain less
When she staring deep in the windows of my soul
I'd be painless, but shit I'm brainless
Oxycodone crossing my conscious, she haunting
Thoughts of her often never acknowledging
The pain that I'm swallowing
Beautiful butterfly’s flutter in my oesophagus
So I pop, pop, pop em’ like they lozenges

I really like your friends
Especially anxiety, we really hit it off well
And the other one
Chronic displeasure for the lesser
I wasn't into stepping on necks, now I know better
The red flags drape on your Double D’s nice
You love to show me to your friends, say my tracks cool as ice
But my pulse froze for ya
Songs I wrote for ya
I would like to slice my throat for ya
(I love you)

Bad, bad, bad
Every time I wanna see you, I wanna die with you
You're Bad, bad, bad
And all your friends bad too, bad too
Bad, bad, bad
Every time I wanna see you, I wanna die with you
You're Bad, bad, bad
=======
Bad, bad, bad
Every time I wanna see you, I wanna be with you
You're bad, bad, bad
And all your friends bad too, bad too
Bad, bad, bad
Every time I wanna see you, I wanna be with you
You’re bad, bad, bad
And all your friends bad too, bad too
