They say when it's right you just know it
Don't fight it just go with it
Hang ten curve lightly
Them doors will start opening
Don't tell yourself you can't do it
Don't expect nobody else to do it for you
Put your chest out cause you doing for you
When you pull up to the party now
Everybody wanna gather round'
And you know how they talk about you
Control what you're putting out
Stay with a swisher now
Everybody know you're pushing loud
Take a hit and pass it round'
On they lips that word of mouth
Travel round' the world and
I ain't even left the room yet
That word so good that
I ain't really have to do much
Got em' doing all the work but
Never doing dirt what
That word so good that
I ain't really have to do much
Still water
Still show up bout' a quarter past eight but I don't falter
Don't do it if I don't wanna
Road block but it won't stop us hey
Do work cause it's that time of day
Wanna swoop well it's alright with me
We can do what we both wanna
Either way I'm gonna
No matter how it turn out
Leave my mark on my city like a burnout
Got gas we don't run out
Golden State big mood hit the lake always sun out
Still hustle all winter
We gonna get along fine you stay minding your business
Whole world my witness
Whole face gonna change when they see you out winning
Travel round' the world and
I ain't even left the room yet
That word so good that
I ain't really have to do much
Got em' doing all the work but
Never doing dirt what
That word so good that
I ain't really have to do much
You heard us word it every track murder verdict
We in the back burning durban
Verbs and herbage ambiance swerved and turfted
Skyline picture perfect
Slap this out the blue
My fam like that's what I was bout' to do
Thick ass bitty jumpin' out the pool
With a mean mug matching that attitude
Word of mouth
When you pull up to the party now
Everybody wanna gather round'
And you know how they talk about you
Control what you're putting out
Stay with a swisher now
Everybody know you're pushing loud
Take a hit and pass it round'
On they lips that word of mouth
That word I got that word
I ain't really gotta do much
Don't hit me with the hey you ain't really tryna do nothing
Got a good mouthpiece
Ain't talking bout' the sex stuff better than the rest of em'
All about my outreach
Say I got a mean mug bitch I gotta mouth feed
No none bout' me
Been around the world but it's never not Cali
