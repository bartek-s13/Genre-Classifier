I've been all alone, I need help
I have nowhere to go by myself
I have to let you go and it hurts me
This shit made me cold and I'm hurting
I've been all alone, I need help
I have nowhere to go by myself
I have to let you go and it hurts me
This shit made me cold and I'm hurting

I just want you by my side and
I take drugs I'm not prescribed and
It's okay for you to cry (Uh)
It's so hard to say goodbye (Uh)
What are you so afraid of?
I'm so tired of the fake love (Mm-hmm)
Sometimes I don't wanna wake up
So I stay up and I take drugs with you

I've been all alone, I need help
I have nowhere to go by myself
I have to let you go and it hurts me
This shit made me cold and I'm hurting
I've been all alone, I need help
I have nowhere to go by myself
I have to let you go and it hurts me
This shit made me cold and I'm hurting
By my side, yeah
By my side, yeah
By my side, yeah

I've been all alone, I need help
I have nowhere to go by myself
I have to let you go and it hurts me
