<<<<<<< HEAD
A brand new heart
For your counterpart
You imagined life
Before they walked into the dark
An alternate life
Slowly rides the line
And all it takes is watering at night
Wait to climb aboard
Destruction to a T
Shattering responsibility
Sometimes it's easier said than done
Eternal life
From earthly vacation
A burning knife
Won't cut you out of ice cold persuasion
You accepted the ride
With the exception of life
You might find yourself in love
With deception and lies
An unconventional mind
Was your ticket to die
You may have found
Your dot in the sky
They never heard from you
And it became a concern
You were gradually conditioned
With nowhere to turn
You went to climb aboard
Construction to a T
Shattering responsibilities
Eternal life
From earthly vacation
A burning knife
Won't cut you out of ice cold persuasion
You accepted the ride
With the exception of life
You might find yourself in love
With deception and lies
An unconventional mind
Was your ticket to die
You might find yourself in love
With your dot in the sky
You accepted the ride
With the exception of life
You might find yourself in love
With deception and lies
An unconventional mind
Was your ticket to die
You might find yourself in love
