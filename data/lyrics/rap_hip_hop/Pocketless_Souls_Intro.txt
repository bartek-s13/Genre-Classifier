<<<<<<< HEAD
Good morning, Brethren
I wanna um, I just wanna give you a little word this morning
This is - it's something' written by somebody anonymous, so all glory be to God
Be not afraid
Health and wealth are coming to you
My wealth, which is sufficiency for your needs
And for My work you long to do
Money, as some call wealth, to store up or display - you know that is not for my disciples
Journey through this world simply seeking the means to do My will and work
Never keep anything you are not using
Remember, all I give you will be mine, only given to you to use
Could you think of me hoarding my treasures?
You must never do it
Rely on Me
To store for the future is to fear and to doubt me
Check every doubt of me at once
Live in the joy of my constant presence
Yield every single moment to me
Perform every task, however humble, as at my gentle bidding
And for Me, for love of Me
So live, so love, so work
You are the apostles of the little services
