Don't get me wrong, I’ll step with the kitchen
Rah, it's BKay
Jump out, turn bad boy into a victim
Still get round if the whips not tinted
Bow

Don't get me wrong, I’ll step with the kitchen, pop this door, bare t shirts ripping
Ten out of ten, these opps are sprinting, jump out, turn bad boy into a victim
Still get round if the whips not tinted, free Boogie B, he's very ambitious
Cah my bro likes riding on opps, lean and bop with the dots or dip him

Jump out the ride, they run off, I catch up, I ching that yute and twist it
What you know about ducking a big man, he hopped one fence then he went missing
I can tell you 'bout sitting in the back seat, opp block, lurking around with spinners
The life that I live is vicious, rise up waps and circle your district
Got things in the Adidas pouch, there's always one thing that I doubt
They're gonna ride back when your friends get bored up, Lil' Jojo ain't rid 'till now
Fuck, mans really beefing clowns, they’re staying at home when I circle around
We skid round, opp boys hit ground, opps get got, man I think I lost count
Lowe all the chat man, who you tryna please? On the opp block with my five times three
SJ shanked two yutes at the scene, windows smashed, of course it was Creepz
On the wing niggas know about me, first day I come out I chased that neek
I guess it’s a life of a savage, shank that yute pray no one speaks
I'll slap at the opps, no questions
I come from Broadwater Farm, rise up guns or niggas get cheffing
My phone ain’t coming on glides, two door crash, bro chinged that splendid
I whacked my man and his head got dented
Running his sales, oh yes I attempted, bro hopped out of the ride and kweffed him
On the wing I had to kick mans face, now I gotta deal with the nickings
Sitting on the block with a grin on my face, safe guards ask me who do I beef
They really think I'm gonna tell them names, you can chinged just like —
Flew straight back and burned my jacket, gang chinged up like four that day
Don't get me wrong, I'll step with the kitchen, pop this door, bare t shirts ripping
Ten out of ten, these opps are sprinting, jump out, turn bad boy into a victim
Still get round if the whips not tinted, free Boogie B, he’s very ambitious
Cah my bro likes riding on opps, lean and bop with the dots or dip him
Don't get me wrong, I'll step with the kitchen, pop this door, bare t shirts ripping
Ten out of ten, these opps are sprinting, jump out, turn bad boy into a victim
Still get round if the whips not tinted, free Boogie B, he's very ambitious
Cah my bro likes riding on opps, lean and bop with the dots or dip him

You can hold six, seven or eight
I'll ride for my bros, no lie, pull up on them and they relocate, four door trip, bro's holding the gauge
And you don't wanna test bros temper, dip him, chest and up or get shaved
Turning back, is it in their brain? They wanna escape but it goes two ways
I'll lean out of that ride, close one eye and slap it twice
It was a blacked out four door I hopped out, nearly got drenched but he cut for his life
I can tell you about countless rides, bucked white boy, could've taken his life
Went over there but they're not outside, if I brought my phone cah they brought up a line
Fuck with them, you can get it like them
Have you ever ran man down on the main, Rambo out tryna rip through flesh
Tinted ride pulling up in your ends, jump out the ride man do it like feds
Lil' Jojo got cheffed up again, — really got put on the bench, on the opp block we beat off skengs
I can tell you about times on the wing, couldn't keep apart, see Smokey's friend
I beef big men but they're cowards, they don't ride back when suttin' get drenched
Chest shot crew, your best bet is a vest, on the opp block we ain't aiming for legs
