STRANGE FROOT

Dog Quit shooting at me
Quit shooting at me
You see they shooting at us

Shooting at me but I got my hands up
Said I hung my self but I'm in handcuffs
Kilt me in a cell for a traffic stop
Smoked my little man said he had a gloct
Gloct 9
Got mine
Registered
But he done shot me at the stop sign
Got time
Cuz a cop lied
Said that I whistled at a white girl?
Got a closed casket welcome to my world!
Where the black don't crack
Except it's black on black
Doing donuts around you racists
I'm back on track
They don't believe a bunch of atheist
Murdered Raheem for his playlist
Do the right thing get beat to ape s***
Monkey dancing all in them cages
Africa's baby
America raised me
Born into slavery
Look what it made me
I'm going crazy
Good Lord Come save me now!
Don't let em take me
They tryna taint
I feel it ain't me
Still going crazy
But I can't let them take me down

Stalking me I'm tryna get the hell home
Shot me down for holding my cell phone
Choked my main man til he passed out
Kilt my son while he took the trash out
But good black don't crack
Except it's black on black
We after racks on racks
I'm on my Cj walker
You really think this black gone nap?
Wide awake I could see the goal
But one of my man's caught a pita roll
Never knew the streets could be this cold
Don't think about it
When police patrol
Better get Alzheimer's
Killed Betty Jonez
She see was in a cross fire
Ameri-KKKA
Set a cross
Lost fire
Stepping on the head of the wrong viper
Chorus: FR33 THA SINNER]
Africa's baby
America raised me
Born into slavery
Look what it made me
I'm going crazy
Good Lord Come save me now!
( Raye Cole : Come save me now)
Don't let em take me
They tryna taint
I feel it ain't me
Still going crazy
But I can't let them take me down
( Raye Cole: I can't let them break me down !)

Black bodies
In the summer breeze
Strange....
On the pop...

Officer please!
Please Don't shoot!
Got blood on the keys
And blood on the coop
My brother please!
Please don't shoot!
Got blood on the leaves
And blood on the roots
Strange Froot (Repeat 4X)
Got blood on the leaves (Repeat 2X)
And blood on the roots

My mother was Africa
Daddy was massacred
All I know is my Massa's love
Good lord come save me now!
Don't let em capture us
They still attacking us
Til the day that you rapture us
I can't let them break me down!

Officer please !
Please don't shoot
I'm down on my knees
I'm telling the truth
My brother please !
Please don't shoot!
I'll give you my keys
Here take the loot
Strange Froot
This a new Strange Froot ( Repeat 2X)
Got blood on the leaves &amp;
Blood on the roots
Strange Froot
This a new Strange Froot

Once the police
Have convinced the white public
That the so-called Negro community
Is a criminal element
They can go in and question
Brutalize
Murder unarmed, innocent Negroes
And the white public
Is gullible enough to back them up
This makes the Negro community
A police state
This makes the Negro neighborhood
A police state
It’s the most heavily patrolled
It has more police in it than any other neighborhood
Yet it has more crime in it than any other neighborhood
How can you have more cops and more crime? Why?
It shows you that the cops must be in cahoots with the criminals
