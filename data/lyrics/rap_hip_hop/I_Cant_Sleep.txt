Hey what's the matter honey?

I don't sleep 'cause when I do
All my dreams are dreams of you
And in yours you say your teeth are falling out
I don't sleep 'cause when I do
All I dream are dreams of you
And in yours you say your teeth are falling out

Yeah
Yes, I threw away my phone in case you'd ever call
I never leave my house in case I meet you at the mall
Never talk to my friends that you're friends with
Because I know they're gonna ask why we ended
Anything to do with you I keep it on the low
Used to wish that you would stay, now I'm wishin' you would go
So I came up with a remedy I promise I would keep
In order to ignore you I'll just never fall asleep

I don't sleep 'cause when I do (when I do)
All I dream are dreams of you (they all of you)
And in yours you say your teeth are falling out (yeah, yeah)
I don't sleep 'cause when I do
All I dream are dreams of you
And in yours you say your teeth are falling out

Yeah, I haven't slept in like a year, my fear keeps me awake
'Cause if I doze off then I might see you face to face
I just turn on my TV and sit straight up onto my couch
'Cause when I doze off I hear the words from your mouth
Used to wake up uncontrollably crying like every time
Getting shivers, feeling sick whenever you would cross my mind
So I came up with a remedy I promise I would keep
In order to ignore you I just never fall asleep

I don't sleep 'cause when I do
All I dream are dreams of you
And in yours you say your teeth are falling out (falling out)
I don't sleep 'cause when I do
All I dream are dreams of you
And in yours you say your teeth are falling out (yeah)
