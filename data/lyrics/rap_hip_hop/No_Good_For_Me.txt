It feel amazing
I'm on the road, I’m going up, I might be famous
I might be famous

Baby, I know that you ain't no good for me
And I can't take it no more, ’cause you were so good to me
I'm done with love, I'm giving up, I'm losing trust
I done been through situations when it all was getting rough
I hate to see you down, but I'll be there to pick you up
In any situation, if you call me, I'll pull up

It feel amazing, I'm on the road, I'm going up, I might be famous
I’m doing shows, I keep it close case it get dangerous
And she promote me with the shit until I make it, it feel amazing
You know what’s up, you ain't tryna lose me
In every state, my shows turn into movies
I ain’t gon' tell you nothing, I'ma let you see
And hopefully you'll notice you was meant for me
I just hope that you know

Baby, I know that you ain’t no good for me
And I can't take it no more, 'cause you were so good to me
I'm done with love, I'm giving up, I'm losing trust
I done been through situations when it all was getting rough
I hate to see you down, but I'll be there to pick you up
In any situation, if you call me, I'll pull up
I ain't gon' lie, I'd reminisce at times
Confused, sadly thinking, "This bitch really mine?"
But now I be focused on bigger things, I'm in my prime
Ain't nothing gon' stop me
I'm always skipping through the lines, ain't wasting time
Always gon' ride for you, and baby, that's a fact
Feels so good to give some love and get it back
All these feelings involved, we wasn't supposed to get attached
No TBT, I miss the way she throw it back

Baby, I know that you ain't no good for me
And I can't take it no more, 'cause you were so good to me
I'm done with love, I'm giving up, I'm losing trust
I done been through situations when it all was getting rough
I hate to see you down, but I'll be there to pick you up
In any situation, if you call me, I'll pull up

It feel amazing
I'm on the road, I'm going up, I might be famous
