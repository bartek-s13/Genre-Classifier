Niggas never showed up
Got the guap and soda
I would never fold, niggas snitching yeah they told 'em
You the opp, a phony
Rock em like a boat, uh
All the mega shit, bitch I do not fuck with most

I got the plug calling
I got the hundred calling
Nigga you snitchin' and telling on nigs
You got 400 dollars on your head
Niggas they run on up 'em
My niggas they run on up 'em
I got ten brothers with doogies and toolies
I put a dozen on 'em on your head

Nigga they pull up with letters
Niggas they pull up with bread on 'em
Go suicide and that nigga ain't jokin' like 
Bitch I be pullin' and gettin'
I just be countin' the bread, oh
Counted a hundred and fifty, all of the guap, I can not let go
Nah, nah nah nah nah, pull up with nana's
Oppies yeah they snitchin', they be dead, fuck 'em all
Nah, nah nah nah nah, pull with choppers
I be on that bullshit, if you talkin' all that opp shit

I got the slug calling
I got a hundred calling
Nigga you snitchin' and telling on nigs
You got 400 dollars on your head
Niggas they run on up 'em
My niggas they run on up 'em
I got ten brothers with doogies and toolies
I put a dozen on 'em on your head

Fill up a nigga like bullet your face
I got them hundreds you cannot relate
Losin' a nigga like washin' a plate
Bitch I be ballin' on  and cape
We used to pull up with fake shit
Now we be flexin' with Bape shit
Bought the Balenciaga like 8-6
I'm from the block that went 8-6
Pull up with niggas in Rovers
She tryna suck me like Gogurt
Coppin' that shit at a mall
And copyin' back I be lookin' way older
Bitch I be shootin' like soldiers
Rockin' a nigga like boulder
Catchin' him static like toaster
X in that clip if we loaded
Yah, yah, we loaded
Rockin' a nigga like boulders
Yah, oh, yah, yah, yah
Nah, nah nah nah nah, pull up with nana's
Oppies yeah they snitchin', they be dead, by the mallroom
Nah, nah nah nah nah, pull with choppers
I be on that bullshit, if you talkin' all that hot stuff
