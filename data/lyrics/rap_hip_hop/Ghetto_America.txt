Oh
Ah-ah, oh
Oh, oh, oh (Oh)
Ayy, yeah (Hey, hey)

I'm from the trenches where it's you or me
But I show love to all my brothers like I'm Huey P
Ain't no guidance, OG ain't worried 'bout truancy
Shorty got caught up on that side, they beat him brutally
Traumatized, my whole city been through cruelty
Send them shots, somebody died, it happens usually
On the block, them guys don't tolerate no foolery
Watch my young nigga spend them racks on jewelry (Yeah)

Young king, you just gotta stay focused
On the grind, gotta get it, ain't no feelin' hopeless
I done been through what you been through, why you mopin'?
Had to take that risk and put my wrist in motion
I was young and reckless, I know that I'm older
Stayed out late, so I came home with moms and Pepsi Cola
Stayed out late 'cause I was workin', whippin' up the cola
And I pray 'cause I got angels watchin' over shoulders
Baby, what's the hold up? I can't go for hold up
I can't trust too many bitches, they got plenty motives
You niggas was penny pinchin', they won't say they stole none'
I came from the city, ain't no pity, cross you over
Death before dishonor, that's just how I live
I don't mean no harm, but for my brothers, I'll kill
Got it from the bottom, grinded up for real
Remember we was starvin', grindin' for the meals

I'm from the trenches where it's you and me
But I show love to all my brothers like I'm Huey P
Ain't no guidance, OG ain't worried 'bout truancy
Shorty got caught up on that side, they beat him brutally
Traumatized, my whole city been through cruelty
Send them shots, somebody died, it happens usually
On the block, them guys don't tolerate no foolery
Watch my young nigga spend them racks on jewelry (Yeah)

See, my cousin, he got laced, he bought weed without the seal
And I'm steady losin' my mind, don't know if it's the demons or the pills
I was in the county jail when Sosa 'nem had signed a deal
I'ma self-defend myself like it was an accident I killed
See, my brother Will on trial, boy, niggas left him hangin'
They ain't even go to trial for him, his homie wrote a statement
If I ain't never signed to Def Jam, I told Gotti I'll sign to him
Shout out to the city, they gon' envy like I'm Calboy
I don't know what you heard 'bout me
Don't believe the media, nigga, you know you should be worried 'bout me
Police snatched me up, but they know they ain't get a word out me
Pillow talkin' to these hoes, why you ask a girl 'bout me? Mmh
Yeah, you got some nerves 'bout it
You comin' 'round to take some pics and get some syrup out me
Neighborhood hero
I done lost an oldhead who died over CeeLo
And my life a VEVO, yeah

I'm from the trenches where it's you and me
But I show love to all my brothers like I'm Huey P
Ain't no guidance, OG ain't worried 'bout truancy
Shorty got caught up on that side, they beat him brutally (Yeah)
Traumatized, my whole city been through cruelty (Yeah)
Send them shots, somebody died, it happens usually (Rrr)
On the block, them guys won't tolerate no foolery (For real)
Watch my young nigga spend them racks on jewelry (Real, look, look)

I just lost one of my dogs (Damn), they post it on a blog (For real?)
The case still open, social media the laws (Them niggas trippin')
I was re-in' up when these niggas was doin' fraud (Yeah)
Niggas scammin', I was grammin', givin' packs to my dawgs (Facts)
Check my history, nigga, I don't do battle rappin' (At all)
I'm like a hundred mil' up when I get tired of rappin' (I'm tall)
All time high, you should be tired of cappin'
When you put in some work, I don't wanna know what happened (Shh)
I'm really from the trenches, pull the Lam' in it (Skrrt)
Nigga, you ain't from that hood, you ain't sold a gram in it (Hah)
Your grandma live there, so you probably came and visit
Auntie never let you leave the house, that's a big difference (We ain't the same, homie)
Niggas claimin' shit that they won't die for (How?)
If you so real like you say, then what you lyin' for? (How?)
Never treat your main bitch worse than your side ho (Never)
And I can see a snake with a blindfold (Sneakin')

I'm from the trenches where it's you and me
But I show love to all my brothers like I'm Huey P
Ain't no guidance, OG ain't worried 'bout truancy
Shorty got caught up on that side, they beat him brutally
Traumatized, my whole city been through cruelty
Send them shots, somebody died, it happens usually
On the block, them guys don't tolerate no foolery
Watch my young nigga spend them racks on jewelry (Yeah)

Yeah
Ayy, look, Calboy
I might pull up in the Chi', nigga
With them Rolls trucks back to back, you hear me? Yeah
And jumpin' in with them drakes, nigga, look how we movin'
Yeah, we rich gangsters, nigga, facts
We gon' slide at 'em raw, rented that shit, nigga
Wreck it, jump out, leave it there
Yeah, that's how we movin'
On that rich gangster shit, nigga
You know what I mean? Hah
Frrt, beep
