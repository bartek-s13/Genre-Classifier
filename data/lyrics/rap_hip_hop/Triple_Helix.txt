Wake up, and I've realized that I've denied who I really was
My whole life I have tried to let me ego die and just rise above
There is no love, if you don't allow it
I know I am enough but right now my spirit's ungrounded
The doubt is just caving in, it's amazing when I'm feeling at the end
It's only light I wanna be taking in, as I'm gazing in, to the thoughts I've sent
Uh, and how could it be, that I didn't see, my heart would retreat
In the presence of fear I appeared to flee, as I backed away from my destiny
But now, I know I'm alive, my body will rise, blend with the skies
To hell with your lies, I am not blind, I see your disguise
We are all one and connected, and lately I've been feeling tempted
To let go of all of the wreckage, that the powers in this world have projected
There is no room for the fear
Age of divisions is finally here
Reminiscing on each one of my tears
The intuition's been inside me for years
This world is not how it appears
Disconnection is nothing but a lie
Believing that this is all real
Inhibits your spirit from feeling alive
Triple helix in my DNA I am ascending
To sit back and believe this world's ok, we are pretending
Triple helix in my DNA I am ascending
To sit back and believe this world's ok, we are pretending
Old structures breaking down, being ruptured from my crown
Chakra opening, can't handle this new energy that's been floating in
Responding to the sounds of all these beings I have found
And I'm knowing them, to release all of these concepts they've been holding in
I'm growing when I start listening, to the subtle voices inside
And knowing that they've been whispering, but it's up to me to decide
And that's why, I ignite the fire, find a new way of living that'll bring me higher
On the mountain of destiny, amounting to see the full self that I have aspired
To be in my dreams when I'm leaving, my body right here for the astral plane
Records of the Akash I am seeing cause the future, the present, the past is the same
Eleven eleven the time is right now in this moment
Follow the dreams in your heart, if you are alive then you have been chosen
This is my journey, this is no destination
But I am not returning to a life that is complacent
This is my journey, this is no destination
But I am not returning to a life that is complacent
There is no room for the fear
Age of divisions is finally here
Reminiscing on each one of my tears
The intuition's been inside me for years
This world is not how it appears
Disconnection is nothing but a lie
Believing that this is all real
Inhibits your spirit from feeling alive
There is no room for the fear
Age of divisions is finally here
Reminiscing on each one of my tears
The intuition's been inside me for years
Triple helix in my DNA I am ascending
To sit back and believe this world's ok, we are pretending
Triple helix in my DNA I am ascending
To sit back and believe this world's ok, we are pretending
