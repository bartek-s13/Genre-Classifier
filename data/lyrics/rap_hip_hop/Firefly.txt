Never let the 'lil fan know what the rock has plannin' on doin'
Hey, I got created back in '99, tryna keep my stars in line
The left hand now knows what the right hand is doing
You can consider yourself lucky to get past the haters and the fake friends
I wish I had another life, I would start over again (So long)

I wish I was a firefly, I would light up the night (So long)
Sting like a bumble bee, float like a butterfly (So long)
I wish I was a firefly, I would light up the night (So long)
Sting like a bumble bee, float like a butterfly

I pray to God every night (Every night), Father, do you hear my cry? (Hear my cry?)
I tried talking to the preacher man (Preacher man), but he don't sound right (Sound right)
I still drink from the bottle, I smoke a little weed
I got suicidal thoughts lookin down from my balcony
I been out here all alone, I been gettin' it on my own, that what makes a man strong
But sometimes you need a shoulder to lean on, sometime you need a friend to depend on (So long)

I wish I was a firefly, I would light up the night (So long)
Stayin' like a bumble bee, floatin' like a butterfly (So long)
I wish I was a firefly, I would light up the night (So long)
Stayin' like a bumble bee, floatin' like a butterfly
Never let the 'lil fan know what the rock has plannin' on doin'
Hey, I got created back in '99, tryin' to keep my stars in line
You can't consider yourself mighty, look at getting past the haters and the fake friends
