I'm feeling lights out, I’m feeling shut down
And when I speak up, nothing wanna come out
I been chained up to (I been chained up to), my mind
I'm tryna wake up, and find a new love
And tell the old me that I've had enough
Tryna leave it all (Tryna leave it all), behind

I’ve been looking for the nightlight switch
I've been feeling like I'm over it
When feelings control me, they ain't gonna hold me back

Love me and let me go, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Love me and let me go, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Love me and let me
Walk away, finally let me breathe
Stop being so obsessed with me
Love me and let me go
Love me and let me go

Let me go, let me go
Let me go now
Let me go, let me go
Let me go now
Let me go, let me go
Let me go now

Thank you for the bad times and the land mines
And them feelings that came like landslides
Runnin' down my mind (Runnin' down my mind) each night
Thank you for the dark days and the tidal waves
Making real life feel so sideways
Really been a wild (Really been a wild) wild ride

I've been looking for the nightlight switch
I've been feeling like I’m over it
When feelings control me, they ain’t gonna hold me back

Love me and let me go, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Love me and let me go, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Love me and let me
Walk away, finally let me breathe
Stop being so obsessed with me
Love me and let me go
Love me and let me go

Let me go, let me go
Let me go now
Let me go, let me go
Let me go now
Let me go, let me go
Let me go now
Let me go, let me go
Let me go now
Let me go, let me go
Let me go now
Let me go, let me go
Let me go now
