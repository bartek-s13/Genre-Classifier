There's a light in the darkness
Though the night is black as my skin
There's a light burning bright, showing me the way
But I know where I've been

There's a cry in the distance
It's a voice that comes from deep within
There's a cry asking why, I pray the answer's up ahead, yeah
'Cause I know where I've been

There's a road we've been travelin'
Lost so many on the way
But the riches will be plenty
Worth the price, the price we had to pay

There's a dream in the future
There's a struggle that we have yet to win
And there's pride in my heart 'cause I know where I'm going
Yes I do!
And I know where I've been, yeah

There's a road (There's a road)
We must travel (We must travel)
There's a promise (There is a promise)
We must make (That we must make)
But the riches (Oh, but the riches)
Will be plenty (The riches will be plenty)
Worth the risk (Worth the risk)
And chances that we take (and the chances that we take)
There's a dream
Yeah yeah yeah
In the future
There's a struggle
That we have yet to win
Use that pride
In our hearts
To lift us up
Until tomorrow
Cause just to sit still
Would be a sin

I know it, I know it
I know where i'm going

Lord knows I know
Where i've been

Oh! When we win
