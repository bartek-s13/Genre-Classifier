Yeah, good drugs on a Wednesday
I don’t care what the fake say
Put them up or get out my face
Stay or go, you won't stay the same
Stay or go, you won't stay the same
Yeah, you need a meaning in this song
Listen to my words, they're all wrong
I don't really care what's at wrong
The finer things are all that I want

Can you feel it building up
No, this isn't really what I want
I'ma get the bag then, I'ma run
I'ma break your heart then, I'ma run
You're gonna see me in your dreams
All blacked, yeah
With my ripped up jeans
Roll another wood it's my only remedy
What we had was good but life got you beat, yeah
Can you feel it building up
No, this isn't really what I want
I'ma get the bag then, I'ma run
I'ma break your heart then, I'ma run
You're gonna see me in your dreams
All blacked, yeah
With my ripped up jeans
Roll another wood it's my only remedy
What we had was good but life got you beat, yeah
I feel the pressure building up, building up, building up
I feel the pressure building up
I feel the pressure building up, yeah

Yeah, good drugs on a Wednesday
I don’t care what the fake say
Put them up or get out my face
Stay or go, you won't stay the same
Stay or go, you won't stay the same
Yeah, you need a meaning in this song
Listen to my words, they're all wrong
I don't really care what's at wrong
The finer things are all that I want
Yeah, good drugs on a Wednesday

Listen to my words, they're all wrong
I don't really care what's at wrong
The finer things are all that I want

The finer things are all that I want
The finer things are all that I want
The finer things are all that I want
The finer things are all that I want
The finer things are all that I want
The finer things are all that I want
The finer things are all that I want
The finer things are all that I want
The finer things are all that I want
