My lil' boy 3, I just gave him a 'Vette
The backend too big so they sent me a check
Don't want your number, I only want sex
If she don't give me head, I'ma cut off her neck
You get an F and an N if you test it
They hate to say it, I'm one of the best
If she tried to curve me, I fuck on her bestie
I told Lil Gotit he gotta be next
You don't get points if you fuck on my ex
You don't do work, you for real? I'm like, "Next"
I'm runnin' laps around niggas, no sweat
Invested half a ticket on my necklace
I'm with the slime, this shit can get treacherous
I don't want no green, I only want red
I only want beans? Bitch, I ain't green (Yeah)
"Do you want a Perc?" Hell yeah, that's me (Oh yeah)
