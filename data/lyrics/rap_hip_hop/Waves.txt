I'm making...
Don't tell em, don't tell em (no)

I said I'm making waves in the ocean
You think that you know shit
Waves in the ocean, Gotta stay in motion
Waves in the ocean, Yeah I got the potion
Waves in the ocean, Need my pockets so big
Putting out the content, hoping that you know this
I be on my own, so I gotta stay focused
Waves in the ocean, scoping like a Locus
Yeah I got the potion, waves up in the ocean

Like a drone I be floating
Takes yours down in my room, so I wrote this
In it for my dreams, and you know that I won't miss
I just set a goal, execute, ain't no hoping
How you gonna bump my shit, and say you ain't about it?
He like CP3, I'm all about it, who is stopping me?
That's nobody, you hear them MP3s
You know how it be, I said bitch I really do this!

I said I'm making waves in the ocean
You think that you know shit
Waves in the ocean, Gotta stay in motion
Waves in the ocean, Yeah I got the potion
Waves in the ocean, Need my pockets so big
Putting out the content, hoping that you know this
I be on my own, so I gotta stay focused
Waves in the ocean, scoping like a Locus
Yeah I got the potion, waves up in the ocean
Now everybody excited about the nice shit
Me? I'm the type to stay home, balling, and write shit
Do the right thing, I'm left out, so righteous
Fuck the nicest, I'm right with my right wrist
C and Tyson, but I take the right risks
Safe road, no fighting, like Mike Tyson
Home run, we just won in the nine shit
I'm grinding and I don't got no design shit
Posting, so truthful, never lying
I'm high and fuck your jet, cause we flying
Me, myself, and I, we clicked up, we tied in
What ya hiding? I see yall like Poseidon
Going live up on the G where we riding!
Then we come home like night and I dive in
Try to hit me up, I ghost cause I'm writin'
Double play, creme brulee, I'm my highest type shit

I said I'm making waves in the ocean
You think that you know shit
Waves in the ocean, Gotta stay in motion
Waves in the ocean, Yeah I got the potion
Waves in the ocean, Need my pockets so big
Putting out the content, hoping that you know this
I be on my own, so I gotta stay focused
Waves in the ocean, scoping like a Locus
Yeah I got the potion, waves up in the ocean
