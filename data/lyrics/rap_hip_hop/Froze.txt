Wrist could've got froze
Still act like we're broke
If they pull up, it's...
If they pull up, it's smoke

In the charts and in your daughter
Should've kept me in Seychelles
I turn my neck into water
And it came with loads of girls
I see some things and I know some things
I know some things I can't tell
We heard your story, we never bought it
You couldn't serve on the sales
Nearly lost myself but I'm back now
Missed her once, she came back round
We were never in the background
Selling raw, I had the smackdowns
HBK I'm kinda smooth
HBK, gave the boys the truth
We had nothing where we you?
The only option ain't to lose
Used to wanna be like him
Figure niggas is some nobodies
Then I stopped telling niggas shit
Thinking that they would always tell someone
I see niggas turn into a bitch, bitch, bitch
Brand new foreign whip
I know she a Drake fan
We bang back to back in foreign whips
She knows I'm a square man
I use my square to legit
She knows I keep bank rolls
Got elastic bands up on my wrist, wrist
Good brain, I give her tits
Put it on or I'll waste my tips
He was never with the shits
My G's will let it rip
I ain't talking 'bout these YSL
I'm talking bro with the...
Clips, sticks
Wrist could've got froze
Still act like we're broke
If they pull up, it's...
If they pull up, it's smoke
Wrist could've got froze
Still act like we're broke
If they pull up, it's...
If they pull up, it's smoke

Health is wealth, health is wealth
I pray we never feel poorly
You was doing, I was doing
Let's speak the truth on the story
Bunch of...
Tale, tales
We making notes as well
She's L's but mine as well
We learn, we never fail
Only L's I know are girls
Hostess is fucking...
Hell
Fucking hell, I kiss and never tell
I skip the wing like Bale
And the cell
Hit me on my cell
Direct mail
I've got more styles than...
Gel
You know the suedes as well
Barring hell
Nearly lost myself but I'm back now
Missed her once, she came back round
We were never in the background
Selling raw, I had the smackdowns
HBK I;m kinda smooth
HBK gave the boys the truth
We had nothing where we grew
Wrist could've got froze
Still act like we're broke
If they pull up, it's...
If they pull up, it's smoke
Wrist could've got froze
Still act like we're broke
If they pull up, it's...
If they pull up, it's smoke
