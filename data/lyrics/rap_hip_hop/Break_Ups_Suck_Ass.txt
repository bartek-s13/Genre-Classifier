Yeah, last night, my dad freaked out again
My mom left home and ain't comin' back
This pain's too much, I'm too young for this
Break ups suck ass
(Break ups suck ass)

But that was back when I was young
I can hear it till this day
Both them screaming out their lungs
Wishing I knew what to say
We think love is what we want
Till we come across the bumps
Both expecting different things
No such thing is perfect

Love gets hard to give but I'm not sick of it
Life's too short to stay in pointless arguments
I am not the same, I'll keep you in my grasp
Please don't be afraid 'cause soon this storm will pass
'Cause soon this storm will pass
(Storm will pass)

Let me start from the top, my dad walked out on my mom
I grew up asking the question; "Does the pain ever stop?"
Now that I'm older I see, I needed people to leave
So I could learn from the distance, I could learn how to breathe

But this is how we have to live
Sometimes life treats us like shit
Try our best hope to forget
Leave the past, learn to forgive
We think love is what we want
Till we come across the bumps
Both expecting different things
No such thing is perfect

Love gets hard to give but I'm not sick of it
Life's too short to stay in pointless arguments
I am not the same, I'll keep you in my grasp
Please don't be afraid 'cause soon this storm will pass
'Cause soon this storm will pass
(Storm will pass)
