It's Mxnarchy, baby

You're the one that changed up on me, though
So how you there blaming me, bro?
All I ever wanted was a kilo
You wanted cheap hoes
She's the only girl that I trusted
I can't tell you why I still ducked it
My own mum knows that I've cut bricks
I'm a drug kid
Got my young bulls there right beside of me
Every man knows that they'll slide for me
Them man just do it like a Nike tee
On sight, my G
Yo, it's so rare that I trust now
I just caught a man staring my bustdown
But man didn't care when I caught bus 'round

Sixty racks on a couple of chains
But still I'm feeling like something is strange
When I was broke, I thought money healed pain
But now I realize it's money to blame
Stro and Billy back stuck in the cage
Come like you was home for couple of days
Most of my bros still stuck in their ways
My man slipped, so we stuck him like tape
Four shanks on a bus at the festival
My nigga Mouth took the rap, that's respectable
Now he's just trapped up in Pentonville
And he just had a baby, it's crazy
You don't know what it gets like
Most of my niggas in jail, while I'm living my best life
Been through the hell, bro, you know what my head's like
So many cells, I don't even know what my bed's like
So they say that they're happy, it's me though
We was all moving scatty on free-flow
Robbin' and bangin' for weed smoke
Now all of my landings are Heathrow
There's stamps on my passport
Last year, man was stamping on half straw
Govs running mad so I'm bankin' my last straw
Now, I go to the bank for a large draw
Life's getting mad, I don't know who to trust
And if you ain't the gang, then you're no use to us
All my niggas in jail, I don't know who to bust
S 63, no, I don't use the bus
And I can't get the train too
My niggas is messy and that's why he stained you
One in my press, watch me make two
I run through a mil', but you know I'm the same yute
You're the one that changed up on me, though
So how you there blaming me, bro?
All I ever wanted was a kilo
You wanted cheap hoes
She's the only girl that I trusted
I can't tell you why I still ducked it
My own mum knows that I've cut bricks
I'm a drug kid
Got my young bulls there right beside of me
Every man knows that they'll slide for me
Them man just do it like a Nike tee
On sight, my G
Yo, it's so rare that I trust now
I just caught a man staring my bustdown
But man didn't care when I caught bus 'round

It's funny how life goes
Blood, I moonwalked on a tightrope
Where I'm from, little niggas get bored
Then we ride 'round lookin' for a kid like I'm Shiro
I know that life gets crazy
And I know a lot of niggas wanna page me
That's why I gotta stay with a gunner
None of these man got a mixtape with Lil Baby
Nah, I live life on the line
Bro, I feel like I'm fightin' with time
For myself, I wish time, it could last
But for my guys, I wish time, it could fly
If my girl wants, we fly to Dubai
Wine and I dine, time of our life
Like my guys doin' road in the six
In a 16, know that you buy or it's bye
I lost too many close to me
Free White Mo, free Codeine Lee
We got a new link overseas
He makes sure the weight rose, no groceries, huh
I give a peng girl aubergine
Pray an egg don't plant in her ovaries
You know what the code is, G
Statement silence, compulsory
That's normal, nah, that's mandatory
Them mans overboard is standard for me
Bigger brother still got a ting handy for me
Anyone of them niggas, they're gonna bang it for me
'Cause that's love, serious love
My mumsy a gem, gotta do it for her sons
Old lady sayin' walk with a friend
Got my jacks still, tell her that I'll do it for the club, trust
You're the one that changed up on me, though
So how you there blaming me, bro?
All I ever wanted was a kilo
You wanted cheap hoes
She's the only girl that I trusted
I can't tell you why I still ducked it
My own mum knows that I've cut bricks
I'm a drug kid
Got my young bulls there right beside of me
Every man knows that they'll slide for me
Them man just do it like a Nike tee
On sight, my G
Yo, it's so rare that I trust now
I just caught a man staring my bustdown
