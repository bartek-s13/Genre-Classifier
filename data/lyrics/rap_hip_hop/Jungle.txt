(Put a bib on me)
Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, drooling over you
The things you do

These days, I'm letting God handle all things above me
(Put a bib on me)
The things I can't change are the reasons you love me
(Put a bib on me)
Listen, you can hear them calling my name
(Rock me real slowly)
I'm all over the place, I can't sit in one place
I'm not ashamed at all
Still findin' myself, let alone a soulmate, I'm just sayin' (Put a bib on me)
Feel like we one in the same, our relationship changed
(Just like a baby, drooling over you)
That or it never existed, yeah
Whenever they say somethin' bout us you listen
But fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you
Forget what they talkin' about on your timeline, yeah
'Cause that's cuttin' all into my time with you
My time with you, my

Rock me real slowly (Rock me baby, yeah, uh-uh)
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, drooling over you
The things you do

He said you're my everything (Put a bib on me)
I love you through everything, I done did everything to him
(Put a bib on me)
He forgave me for everything, this a forever thing
(Rock me real slowly)
Hate that I treat it like it's a whatever thing
Trust me, boy, this shit is everything to me
He from the jungle, he from the jungle
(Put a bib on me)
I take somebody else's car, drive there undercover
(Just like a baby, drooling over you)
This shit is everything to me, this here is everything
Don't know where we stand, I used to hit you 'bout everything
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
If I need to talk are you around?
Are you down for the cause?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
(Rock me real slowly)
Are you down for the cause?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
(Put a bib on me)
Are you down for the cause?
(Just like a baby, drooling over you)
You still down? You still down? You still down?

Rock me real slowly (Yeah, uh)
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, drooling over you
The things you do

These days these new girls, they got me nervous
(Put a bib on me)
They go to school and do bottle service
They can't decide, they keep switching majors
(Put a bib on me)
Being indecisive makes me anxious
Call your number and it's out of service
(Rock me real slowly)
Who can I call for your information?
What am I supposed to do
After we done everything that we've done?
Who is your replacement?
Are we still good? Are we still good? (Put a bib on me)
Are we still good? Are we still good?
(Just like a baby, drooling over you)
