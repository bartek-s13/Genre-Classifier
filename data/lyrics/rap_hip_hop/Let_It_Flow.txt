Let it flow
Let it flow
Let it flow
Let it flow
Let it flow
Let it flow all around me
Let it flow up and down me
From my head down to my feet
Hey, baby, feels good to me
Let it flow
Let it flow
Let it flow
Let it flow
Let it flow
Birds chirping in the trees
Fish floating through the sea
Bees buzzin' in the breeze
I got the music flowing all through me
Let it flow
Let it flow
Let it flow
Let it flow
Let it flow
When I get ready to leave this earth
I wanna look back on my money's worth
I ain't gonna worry 'bout a doggone thing
I pick up my guitar and start to sing
Let it flow
Let it flow
Let it flow
Let it flow
Let it flow
