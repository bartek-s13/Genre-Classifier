Yea, Why you mad
My girl got the Louie bag
And she bad, and she brag
Cause she know that I'm the one
Now hold the bag
All this cash I done made it in a flash if you ask
I stay frozen like the  zero
The diamonds playin' tag

That's why you mad
That's why you mad, huh
Why you mad?
That's why you mad, huh
I stay frozen and them diamonds playing tag
I got this money and these people mad I brag, huh
That's why you mad
Let's just focus on this task
I be counting so much paper
I think that I need a tab
Other rappers they just actors
There no way they're  in my class
Ay Ronnie Badge, they just actors
Ain't no way they in my class
I can't show my face no way I think
I need myself a mask
All these haters tryna have my style
Cause my foot is on the gas
Run up past
These boys fragile ima break 'em like some glass
They prefer past,  stuff is in the past
Let's focus where I'm at
They like Pack'  don't know how to act
They don't know how to add
But this cash it be adding up
Like my major was math
Check my graph
I be everywhere you point at on the grid
I'm being liv'
 wanna kick it like I'm Real Madrid
If you not wifey you can like me
But you cannot have my kid
If you not wifey you can like me
But you cannot have my kid
I take trips, now she wanna trip
Cause she not on my hip
She wanna flip,  I be taking flicks
You know it's just a pic
I'm bout my biz
Yea, I'm bout my biz you know just what it is
I'm off the lit and I'm at the tip
These haters I'm against,  they on the fence
It's cause they know I'm  focused
And I'm in that Jag
I stay frozen like the  zero
The diamonds playin' tag
That's why you mad
That's why you mad, huh
Why you mad?
That's why you mad, huh
I stay frozen and them diamonds playing tag
I got this money and these people mad I brag, huh
That's why you mad

I got drafted down in Pitt
I bought a crib
Now people wanna come
And see just how I live
And now I spit
And these people mad at me because I spit
My rhymes legit
I spit so much that I need a bib
I'm sharp just like needle pins
Off the top don't need a pen
Had to bring this heat again
I just made myself a rack
And I don't mean I'm eatin' ribs
I'm just tryna eat and win
I'm just tryna eat again
Make sure my reign neva end
I'm tryna make it rain like the weatherman
I blew up fast, huh
I made this cash
That's why you mad,  huh
All this money standing tall like a giraffe, huh
I get this money like the first pick of the draft, huh
That's why I tell my girl go shopping
Cause these people cannot stop me
All these people watching me
Cause I'm icy like I play hockey
And I'm counting all this money
And I throw it in the bag
I stay frozen like the  zero
The diamonds playin' tag
That's why you mad
That's why you mad, huh
Why you mad?
That's why you mad, huh
I stay frozen and them diamonds playing tag
I got this money and these people mad I brag, huh
That's why you mad
That's why you mad, huh
I stay frozen and then diamonds playing tag
I got this money and these people mad I brag, huh
That's why you mad
