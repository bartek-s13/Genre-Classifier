I'm finding clarity in kerosene
Incinerating all these memories
I haven't spoke to you since 17
Just thought I'd let you know, you're dead to me
You found yourself in drugs and nicotine
A hollow body like a figurine
I always felt like an accessory
There's love and hate but this was in between

And all I know
Is that there's clarity in kerosene
And all I know
You can't take back the words you said to me

I hope you choke in your sleep
(Choke in your sleep)
While you're dreaming of me
(Dreaming of me)
Suffocate in your sheets
(Suffocate in your sheets)
I'll be the last thing you see
(Be the last thing you see)
And I can see it, looking back now
Every day you'd try to put me in the background
I wasted all this fucking time on you
Every word you said to me, I knew it wasn't true
Roll around with that chip on my shoulder
I told myself that it would change when I'm older
But it's getting harder and I swear to God
That if I had the chance, I would take all the moments
I spent steady, waiting and losing my patience
You fucked with my head, know that I couldn't take it
And I can't forgive you
No, I won't forgive you

I hope you choke in your sleep
(Choke in your sleep)
While you're dreaming of me
(Dreaming of me)
Suffocate in your sheets
(Suffocate in your sheets)
I'll be the last thing you see
(Be the last thing you see)
