I'm building this house on the moon
Like a lost astronaut
Looking at you, like a star
From a place, the world forgot
Bury my love, bury my love, bury my love
I need someone out there to come bury me now
Bury my love, bury my love, bury my love
Could somebody come, come, come and bury me now

See everything just a dream
Cause as soon as when you wake up, its never man what it seems
Some days I see the beauty with everything in between
And other days man this shit feel like its Halloween
Like is it even worth it?
How many times I have to tell you, that I am not perfect
How could you look me in my eyes and say I don't deserve it
I know exactly what I wanted and I went in search it, oh yeah I went and search it
You see you never see the future, you just focus on the was
And instead of having reasons, you just end it with because
So before you give me your all, you put me above
Here's a shovel, now go bury my love

Could somebody come, come, come and bury me now
And you the only girl I listen to
I know its hard to believe it right
I'm seeing things threw a different view
I even think about you when I sleep at night
But you don't like to show emotions
You just put me in a place where I'm hoping
Hoping that one day that you will be there
Hoping that one day you will not be scare
Time could be blurry but soon it will be vivid
Listen to your heart or you could listen to the critics
But before I give you my all and I put you above
Here's a shovel now go bury my love

I love to hear your voice
But still I make the choice
To bury my love, bury my love
