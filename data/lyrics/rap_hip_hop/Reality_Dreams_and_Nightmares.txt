(Chorus)
Take a sip of codeine to fulfill my dreams
I've been drowning in my thoughts
If you know what I mean
Everybody take a couple dark shots for the team
I’m a wake up in the morning and do the same ol thing
Yeah aye
Imma drown in this liquor
Imma drown in this liquor
Imma pull the fucking trigger
Imma pull the fucking trigger
(Verse 1)
I was the big bad wolf well at least that I thought
I don't really know I attended when I want to
I don't really know what I really wanna do
All I really know is I don’t wanna go to school Na. Aye
Now I'm downing this liquor
And my problems getting bigger
I almost pulled the fucking trigger last night.Yeah
But I'm not gonna lose without a fight
I'm a fight this will with my might
I'm a make this left turn right
Everything's gonna be all right
We go get threw the end of the night
We go get to the end of the flight. Well at least that I hope to. Yeah
I won't breath till I turn blue. Yeah
I won't breath till I turn blue
(Chorus)
Take a sip of codeine to fulfill my dreams
I’ve been drowning in my thoughts
If you know what I mean
Everybody take a couple dark shots for the team
I’m a wake up in the morning and do the same ol thing
