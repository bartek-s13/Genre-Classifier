Yo
Man can’t tell me ‘bout loosin’, from time I caught dem man lackin’
Man can’t tell me ‘bout action, come round like fella what's happnin'?
Man can’t tell me ‘bout back off, she back it up I done her back in
Man can’t tell me ‘bout trapping, OT wife fat tings
If you don’t know about that ting, madting sadting
Come round like fella what's happnin'?
Real life I don’t know about acting
Jakes joined up Izzy and Camden
Heli and scram tings
Man can’t tell me ‘bout gang ting
Got my niggas doing life on landings

Man can’t tell me ‘bout this one
Nuttin’ like that one
I was on the ends with this one
I was OT with that one
Man know if a boy flip one
Better bring back one
Man can’t tell me ‘bout sick ones
My OEC’s kidnap ones
Man can’t tell me ‘bout piff ones
I had big back ones
But they all mad ones sad ones
When you gonna buy me a bag ones?
Man can’t tell me ‘bout mad ones
Izzy and Camden
Where it’s all smash and grab ones
Drug deals, Rambos, handguns
Skrrdrrr

Gave my little nigga-nigga like 5 bills
Shoulda seen his face when I buss him
Huh, other one run off with like 5 bills
Shoulda seen his face when I bucked him
Huh, then again when I buss him
Huh, man can’t tell me ‘bout nothin’
Must be smokin’ on somethin’ (bujju)
Like who told him he can do that?
35 for that new wap, you ain’t tryna go through that
Man can’t tell me ‘bout loosin’, from time I caught dem man lackin’
