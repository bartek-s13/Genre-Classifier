<<<<<<< HEAD
(Hello)
(I have decided in 2020 to run for president)

You say I'm pessimistic
Bitches be chasin' after bitches
While they bitchin' my best wishes
Bitch she tryna fuck me cuz she know that I'm getting riches
I been getting to the money fuck nigga ain’t feel it
Got that cold cut coke bitch gone sniff it
I be geekin' off the molly talkin' body can't feel it
30 right up on my hip and you know that I grip it
Got some money on yo head well I'm gettin' them digits
Doubled up the styrofoam then I pour up a 4
Walking like a wok star while I'm rockin' on tour
Smokin' on a backwood got a million to show
One day I'm gone be big get a million a show
Whip around the Rolls Royce bright white like some snow
Bitches snortin' up them lines they a fiend for the coke
Got that rollie on my wrist while Givenchy my coat
Ridin' in a drop top then I switch to the ghost bitch (hold up)

I came and I conquered
Gotta rip it proper
Lames keep hating for reaction never bother
True to my brothers
Put that on my mother
They love to throw dirt like it don’t remain under
My scuffed up air ones
I’m the truth most these other rappers speak in tongues
Educated but I’m still going dumb
Few brews deep in the lab going numb
Came and I got it
Been a young prophet
Getting the profit
I been on a topic
All on the track you know that I be spazzing
Put in my hours I live off of action
Put in my time and I’m tryna live lavish
You won’t get nowhere by just being passive
I been so selfish like I’ll never pass it
Still underground but I’m tryna be massive
Never focused on the headlines
All I’m tryna do is get mine
They throw shade and I still shine
