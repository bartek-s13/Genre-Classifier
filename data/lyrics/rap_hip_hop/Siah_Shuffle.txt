<<<<<<< HEAD
Chorus:
(-Miracle today, and God has always made a way, if you have food-)
(-Perfect people, the perfect people, all the-)
Siah!
This here for my hood to get loose to
Matter of fact, you might as well get used to
S-I-A-H leader of the new school
If I can, you can too, Blue's Clues
Everybody gon' jig to this
I'm in the party and I'm actin' real ignorant
Boy I been cheffin' peep the way I flick my wrist
Spit dope, homie come an' get a hit o' this
I got hits and hits and hits and hits, I never miss
Climb until I reach Everest
So fly, tell me how they gonna feather this
You top five better bet I'm on a better list
I got a flow that's crisp
Need a ghost to whip I pose for flicks with poster chicks
Have you ever seen a rover drift?
Name somebody cold as this, tell 'em hold my dick
Then the chorus hits, like
(Chorus)
Boy turn your speakers up
Know you feel it heatin' up
Chase paper ain't keepin' up
You ain't starve, you can't eat with us
Drift Team countin' cream, you know
Y'all faker than some Sweet'N'Low
All my niggas feastin' yo
Cause ya boy been beastin', whoa
Don't say a word, just move your feet
Don't be afraid to lose your seat
I'm Mayweather, can't be beat
No backup plan, I can't retreat
Duckin' and dodgin' me but my verses hot commodities
I'm humble as I can be but I just be bein' honest, B
I put it down just in case you still haven't noticed
I got the drop, boy, I'm focused
I'm dippin' off in the lotus, whoa
Swear I need that Lam now, even though I am the G.O.A.T
World in my hands before I even wrote my senior quote!
