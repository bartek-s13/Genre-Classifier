CHROUS:
Turn dat four into eight
No more sleeping on the floor a new estate
I don’t know them stop them a the gate
I got bigger visions they don’t know my fate
They don’t know my fate
Might got Might got
Big odds beat them
Your face card grave yard
Wake up they sleeping
Your mistake
I got bigger visions
They don’t know my fate
They don’t know my fate
VERSE 1
Shooting ball wasn’t working out
On the square had me boxed out
Same clothes I was rocking out
Fate help me weigh my options out
Blowing cash no credit
Reload cards using debit
Still young with a shoe fetish
Press the gas blowing unleaded
Unk built a crib when he was twenty six
S550 the whip
Did his time then hit the streets
Then upgrade the drip
Eyes open for me being lower class this wasn’t me
Had to switch it up buckle down then focus on butter b
Turn four into an eight (whip)
Stretch the gold like cake batter
More focus on the long way
Short term really don’t matter
At the bottom stretching my arms
I’m trying to climb the ladder (climb
No more sleeping the floor
Therapeutic well sheeted
CHROUS
Turn dat four into eight

VERSE 2
See you make your own fate
Cause I got me here to date
I can’t help that I win
Cause it’s just in my veins
Make your choice big mistake
So riding early interstate
Just to make it home by five
To feed that family diner plate
I know that my life I got control of it
You can’t take the pressure to much load for you
See me I chase my dreams but I was woke for it
But you you let them streets take a toll on you
Pay your respect where it’s do
Cause we post up like the avenue
Getting that dollar all we ever knew
For a while it was like who is you
Now they see me
All over in my shoes
See what them kings do
See what them kings do

BRIDGE:
Is they going hold me down
No way no way no way no way
Ain’t no sweeter sound
Money machine money machine
I got budget now
So I can pay it I can pay
Around my way they round my way
I just laugh and count my cake
Is they going hold me down
No way no way no way no way
Ain’t no sweeter sound
Money machine money machine
I got budget now
So I can pay it I can pay
Around my way they round my way
I just laugh and count my cake
