Ripping up the riddim with a bottle in my hand
After that I’m in the shout
10 gyal are giving noddy to the gang
Some of them we know from ends
1 or 2 of them are fans
We didn’t bring em back home
Yo we took em to the dance
No fucks to give
You rapping 'bout a gun but you ain't bussing it
I ain't a gangsta we can have a 1 on 1
I ain't jooking him
Hold a quick hook
Then I’m fucking uppercutting him
Man know that I’m local
Nah fuck violence, tell ya gyal to follow me on social
Between us she was laying on the bed
But I swear she told you she was laying down some vocals

We was in the rave, I told Webs I want the blonde there
But J Quiz said he saw her first now he’s on me
I said go on bro I’ll let ya shine ya looking comfy
He told me that he got it in the bag I said trust me

I'ma just step to a peng friend
Batty like RB’s loud, it was 10-10
Drinking all night
It’s kinda sticky like semtex
If anyone's got chewing gums I beg a man send them
What ya telling me? You’re looking kinda fine tonight
Don’t be shy my name's Aitch, I’m the nicest guy
She said, "I know your soon to blow you’re like some dynamite"
She was kinda nervous she wouldn’t look me in the eye
Just relax, be yourself, I ain't famous… yet
Tryna pick it up I’m like Famous… Dex
Told her she can come backstage its… blessed
Then when I blow I’ll be your famous… ex
Nah I’m messing where’s my manners yo
This vodka's got me hammered
I’m just tryna find a balance
She said I got a talent
I said thanks a lot I’m flattered
I think her name was Alice or Alex
Either way she was the baddest
Playing hard to get
She got standards
Rizzing me with questions, you know I got the answers
Aitch can you cook? It would be perfect if you could
I said yeah but I can't make food, I cook bangers
