Stay with me but if you want to leave
Take your things forget all about me
Tell me why you fail to realize
That you might not ever get another try

Girl think
About it before you leave
Cause Bobby's got a brand new swing
And if you wanna do your own thing
I hear what your sayin'
Two can play that game

Your playin'
(Two can play that game)
Two can play that game
(Two can play that game)
If it's good enough for you I'll do it too
(Two can play that game)
Yeah
(Two can play that game)
Lately you've been acting mighty strange
To me it seems your attitude has changed
And suddenly you just don't seem the same
Instead of playin' all those silly games

Girl think yeah
About it before you leave
Cause Bobby's got a brand new swing
And if you wanna do your own thing
I hear what your sayin'
Two can play that game

You're playin'
(Play that game)
Two can play that game
(Play That Game)
Two can play that game
(Play that Game)

Yo Ted drop it
Everybody wants to be a New Jack
Fronting the styles
Of the Brown
It's kind of wild
Now I'm back
But don't get me wrong
'cause I was never gone
It was here all along
You see my flavor stands strong
Ted do they know where I'm coming from? (Yep!)
Hey yo Ted do they know where I'm coming from? (Yep!)
Hey yo Ted do they know where I'm coming from? (Yep! Yep! Yep!)
Bust it
Let's groove to the new type of style and
Get wild and loose
 sweet juice
And when I approach you
There's only two words
It's certainly hurting me
Just better stay still
I move at will
Then I make my kill
Snatch and tackle your brain
God damn I'm insane
But I refrain from using that name
'cause two can play that game
Two
(Two can play that game)
(Two can play that game)
No, no no no, no no no I said two
(Two can play that game)
Two
(Two can play that game)
Oh I said two
(Two can play that game)
Two can play that game
(Two can play that game)
No, no no no, no no no mighty strange
(Two can play that game)
That you changed
You changed
(Two can play that game)
You changed
Changed for the worst baby yeah
(Two can play that game)
What goes around comes around
(Two can play that game)
If you can do it I can do it too
(Two can play that game)
I ain't worried about it
(Two can play that game)
You see what I'm saying?
