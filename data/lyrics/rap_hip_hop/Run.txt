Ye-yeah
1AM
Yah
Ayo Beatz

I see them come, I see them go
You see the wave, Poseidon flow
She feels the beat, she likes the drop
The cars, the bikes, the kicks, the lot
Nowadays we don't compete
I pop, I stream, I clock the scene
They pree, AP, they watchin' me
2Pac 'cause it's all eyes on me

They run, they run
Body anybody, when I pull up on the set, they run
They run, they run
If you ain't talkin' money when I pull on the set, say nothin'
They run, they run
Body anybody, when I pull up on the set, they run
They run, they run
If you ain't talkin' money when I pull on the set (splash)

Nowadays man are gettin' bills just to count this cash
Pull up on a op, they run, they be lookin' like flash
Pull up in a whip, pull it in, pull it out and smash
Then I just dash (skrt, skrt, skrt, skrt)

Hehehe
Yeah, we outta there
Run, run, run, run, run

You know my bars, you know my flow
You know my clubs, we run the show
I break the rules, I break the mould
You see my chain, Seattle gold
We do or die, we drip Dior
She likes it wet, she wants some more
I get the cash, I stack the vault
Man break records like Usain Bolt

They run, they run
Body anybody, when I pull up on the set, they run
They run, they run
If you ain't talkin' money when I pull on the set, say nothin'
They run, they run
Body anybody, when I pull up on the set, they run
They run, they run
If you ain't talkin' money when I pull on the set (splash)
They run (splash)

Nowadays man are gettin' bills just to count this cash
Pull up on a op, they run, they be lookin' like flash
Pull up in a whip, pull it in, pull it out and smash
Then I just stash (skrt, skrt, skrt, skrt)

They run, they run
