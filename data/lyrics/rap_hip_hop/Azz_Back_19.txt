<<<<<<< HEAD
I'm winning the race
I’m fresh out the gate
I got shorty so bad that
We only got time for love baby
We don't got time for the hate
She wanna ring on her finger
She doesn't know what’s at stake
I'm living life like a movie
She wanna part of my scene
I book a flight to Miami
I'm balling like I'm in the league
I put in work while you sleeping
I must of left you in the dream
My ex wanna work out
I told that bitch to try yoga
I work out in my office
Yeah my money is stronger
We went from the rags to the riches
In my telly posted with some bitches
We got a connect for the blow
Ella tiene un buen culo
Ella tiene un buen culo
Ella tiene un buen culo
Shorty got a really nice ass
I love it when she throw that shit back
Girl you look good won't you back that ass up
Girl you look good won't you back that ass up
Girl you look good won't you back that ass up
You a fine motherfucker won't you back that ass up
I’m creeping death like Metallica
I’m am considered a pro
And in my book you are considered an amateur
None of my niggas a fan of ya
I drop the top in the wraith
You won the battle but I won the war
And it looks like I'm winning the race
I’m way ahead in first place
I got a flight to Jamaica
But I'm destined for greatness
I drop a stack on my shorty
Her body's real, you can't fake this
Fendi bag on my arm
See this wrist I got charm
Flow so God damn hot
Please ring the alarm
I got a lot on my mind
Whole lotta dolla signs
I continue to stay on my grind
I left all of the haters behind
We both got the same 24 hrs
Difference between yours & mine?
I got unlimited flow
I got unlimited shine
We went from the rags to the riches
In my telly posted with some bitches
We got a connect for the blow
Ella tiene un buen culo
Ella tiene un buen culo
Ella tiene un buen culo
Shorty got a really nice ass
I love it when she throw that shit back
Girl you look good won’t you back that ass up
Girl you look good won't you back that ass up
Girl you look good won't you back that ass up
