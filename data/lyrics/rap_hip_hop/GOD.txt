<<<<<<< HEAD
(VERSE 1)
Momma told me I been too hard on myself
I took time to recover
I’ve been too hard on my health
Been drinking with my brothers
Ain’t none changing
But the help
And I can’t be nobody else
I find it hard being myself
(Im repping east side)
I see thru you niggas with my 3 eyes
Middle fingers up, like that’s my peace sign
Only roll with 3 guys
Walk up to my label like ITS ME GUYS
Make them cut the check for me
That each time
The illumipqpi
Girls uptown would think I’m Spanish
Yeah
They mimic and copy
They’re like seeds I never planted
Yeah
I fucked up your plannings
And I didn’t even planned it
I’ve been for 6 whole months
You niggas should’ve took advantage
Yeah
(CHORUS)
And I know that they tried to get to get
But all of they shots were missing
(AMEN)
Amen
You got to go thru God to get me
You got to go they God to get me
And you better hope to god they get me
Cuz when the bottles empty
Ain’t none of these shots are missing
(AMEN)
Amen
You got to go they God to get me
You got to go they God to get me
And you better hope to God they get me
(VERSE 2)
Rest in piece my nigga Pete
No I never leave ya side
They would try to pick a brain apart
But they’ll never see the mind
Working hard is just a train of thought
If you never lead the tribe
Ouu now I’m lit
She wanna fuck me
Well bitch you fucking ugly
Can’t touch me
Eyay
(Aye yeah)
Funny moves make funny money
Eyay
(Aye yeah)
Remember when they tried to jump me
Oh yeah
(Aye yeah)
Sour niggas they are
Oh sour niggas they are
More power to ya
Yeah I
Took a break to keep the family straight
What I gotta do nigga
Granny was falling apart
I’d trade to have her here
Over a lot of you niggas
There ain’t a crook in my heart
Number sales is looking like lottery figures
So why did you lie to me killa?
It ain’t a surprise
It’s more an advice to me nigga
(CHORUS)
Cuz I know you tried to get me
But all of your shots were missing
(AMEN)
Amen
You got to go thru God to get me
You got to go they God to get me
And you better hope to God they get me
Cuz when the
Bottles empty
Ain’t none of these shots are missing
(AMEN)
Amen
You got to go thru God to get me
You got to go thru God to get me
And you better hope to God they get me
