Ooaaah ooaahhh
Dir-ty-ty
That's mree, mree
Badabuh buh

Them ah' pree me, I can see angles
Get money, get snakes by your ankles
Any cobras can get handled
Got 'nuff raw soldiers like Dangles
Bun MCs then bun candles
Keep it on wax, that's an eediat ting
Rather thump man and don't talk about it
That's an inside box for your hand ball
Penalty! That's a penalty!
Tour bus look like a Den of Thieves
Champagne shopping like 10 of each
Non-stop popping to the cemetery
They dun know about me!
War time roll out with pure gun man about me!
They can't come around East
Who's that? Get back, draw for the Mac
You can't ramp wi-di-wi-di-wit-it
I'm gonna kill him with it
Might act silly with it
East End legend like Double O wi-di with it
Don't dally, don't dilly with it
No man, I stick Lillies with it
Grown man on some kiddy business
I do rapper and BAFTA shit
Like Bushkin, can't take away my classics kid
If it's war I'ma take it to the mattresses
Where were you back then?
Where were you back then?
Man was putting in work on the roof back then
With a few mandem
Swear no word of a lie I'm the truth right now
I were the truth back then
Man better call Roony for some proof right now
Before we do fact checks
Ooaaah ooaahhh
Badabuh buh
Man can't try school me on this
Man can't try school me on that
Been there, did this and I done
Man been there, did this and I done that
Man run up in houses, run up in flats
Slapped up dogs and slapped up cats
In beef man come with this and that
Man can't try school me about this
Man can't try school me on that
Been there, did this and I done
Man been there, did this and I done that
Man run up in houses, run up in flats
Slapped up dogs and slapped up cats
In beef man come with this and that
No love, man are moving
Badabuh buh

Them think man are bad til man start checking credentials
Wreck instrumentals
They know bout the pen game
But man are still leading with pencils
They ain't been to the mountain once
Shaolin monk when I step in his temple
Tag team, man see legends assemble
Backseat youngers step out with men's tools
Ryu's and Ken's
Why you with them?
Rude boy, mind where you tread
That's thin ice
I see my yute through the lens
That's fish-eye
Believe no truth in your rep
And still I
Reload, do it again
And then deny
Mutual friends wanna ask
Why did I?
What!? Why did I?
Repercussions
Steven, I even suttin'
5 nights, 1 wap that's - even numbers
Hooded up, man see the reaper coming
See, I'm way too gifted
Kill an MC with bare different flows
I can kill an MC with
Presence alone
Level and tone
Timeless and definite flow
And try nuff a take a man's throne
Make a man know
My man's tekkers is cold
Impeccable form
Jason levels was born
In East London where weapons get drawn
Big beef levels with horns
Meat cleavers and several swords
Tea leafs, felons and frauds
CVs read and get torn
These demons could level with Spawn
Ooaaah ooaahhh
Badabuh buh
Man can't try school me on this
Man can't try school me on that
Coz I been there, did this and I done
Yeah man been there, did this and I done that
Man run up in houses, run up in flats
Slapped up dogs and slapped up
In beef man come with this and (nah)
Man can't try school on this
Man can't try school me about that
Coz' I been there, did this and I done
Yeah, been there, did this and I done that
Man run up in houses, run up in flats
Slapped up dogs and slapped up cats
In beef man come with this and that
No laugh, man are moving
Badabuh buh

Trying to stay out of harms way but the trouble keeps on miscallin'
Can't wrap me up when I'm home alone
Man ain't Macaulay me, no Culkin
Live by, then die by, plus pussioles are informers
That's why all the soldiers keep fallin'
Oh my gaardd
Ooaaah ooaahhh
Dir-ty-ty
That's me-me
