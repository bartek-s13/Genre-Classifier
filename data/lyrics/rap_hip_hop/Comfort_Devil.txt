<<<<<<< HEAD
What's to compare when you're close to me?
Though you never were
It's the land sliding down and the vapors rolling off
Though I knew you were
The last living corner as we search for sleep
Good night
When it wears off
You grab the hand in the smoke
When you feel soft
You grab the hand in the smoke
And when you fall asleep in bed
I know the comfort fills your head
Watch out, the mattress is a jail
And now you dream of other beds
It's all in good humor when we laugh at how they talk
You know they're not from here
We can tell them where to go, we can tell them how to walk
They don't pretend
Let them know it's time to go
When the sun is coming up
When it wears off
You grab the hand in the smoke
When you feel soft
You grab the hand in the smoke
And when you fall asleep in bed
I know the comfort fills your head
Watch out, the mattress is a jail
And now you dream of other beds
The end of the city is the end that we fought
You never wrote me back

You enter the city and you're never coming out
