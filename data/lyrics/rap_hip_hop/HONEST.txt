I’D RATHER BE ALONE IF I CAN’T HAVE YOU
WHEN I WANT YOU HOW I WANT YOU
AND I WANT YOU TO BE HONEST
DON’T ANNA LOOK AT YOU RIGHT NOW
GOD DAMNIT I THOUGHT WE WERE SOLID
WHEN DID YOU EVEN FIND TIME
WAS IT SOMETHING THAT YOU PLANNED
DID YOU THINK I WOULDN’T FIND OUT
IF I HADN’T WOULD YOU LOOK AT ME AND LIE
NOW, I THINK I NEED TO LIE DOWN CAUSE I’M
TOO UPSET TO CRY, I JUST NEED SOME TIME
YOU SHOULD GO
I THINK YOU SHOULD GO
MAYBE  YOU SHOULD LEAVE NOW
I THINK YOU SHOULD GO
MAYBE  YOU SHOULD LEAVE NOW
I’D RATHER BE ALONE IF I CAN’T HAVE YOU
WHEN I WANT YOU HOW I WANT YOU
AND I WANT YOU TO BE HONEST
I’D RATHER BE ALONE IF I CAN’T HAVE YOU
WHEN I WANT YOU HOW I WANT YOU
AND I WANT YOU TO BE HONEST
AND YOU BETTER BE HONEST RIGHT NOW
I NEED TO KNOW EVERY DETAIL, ALL THE THINGS
THAT YOU DON’T WANNA TELL ME (TELL ME)
ANY CHANCE OF US SAVING THIS NOW
TREAT ME LIKE A FRIEND
LIKE IT WAS IN THE BEGINNING
AND SHOULD I TAKE THIS ON MYSELF
I KNOW WE WASN;T BUMPING MAYBE WE JUST
GOT TOO COMFORTABLE, IT’S HARD FOR ME
TO TELL, DOESN’T MAKE IT HURT ANY LESS
IS THERE ANYTHING LEFT, IS IT SOMETHING
WORTH SAVING, IT’S A MOUNTAIN TO FORGIVE
WHOLE WORLD TO THROW AWAY THOUGH
YOU SHOULD GO
I THINK YOU SHOULD GO
MAYBE  YOU SHOULD LEAVE NOW
I THINK YOU SHOULD GO
MAYBE  YOU SHOULD LEAVE NOW
I’D RATHER BE ALONE IF I CAN’T HAVE YOU
WHEN I WANT YOU HOW I WANT YOU
AND I WANT YOU TO BE HONEST
I’D RATHER BE ALONE IF I CAN’T HAVE YOU
WHEN I WANT YOU HOW I WANT YOU
AND I WANT YOU TO BE HONEST
AND YOU BETTER BE HONEST RIGHT NOW
I NEED TO KNOW EVERY DETAIL, ALL THE THINGS
THAT YOU DON’T WANNA TELL ME (TELL ME)
ANY CHANCE OF US SAVING THIS NOW
TREAT ME LIKE A FRIEND
LIKE IT WAS IN THE BEGINNING
I DON’T SAY THIS IN VAIN, YOU KNOW THAT I
LOVE YOU, THINGS AIN’T ALWAYS PERFECT
WE’RE ONLY HUMAN, WE MAKE MISTAKES
A LOT OF MISTAKES, I HAD TO MAKE THIS SONG
TO TELL YOU THAT YOU HURT ME, BUT I KNOW
YOU LOVE ME THE SAME, I NEVER QUESTION
WHERE YOUR LOYALTY LAYS
I GOTTA GIVE YOU SHIT CAUSE I WOULDN’T
BE A FRIEND IF I DIDN’T, IMMA PUT YOU RIGHT
WHEN YOU ISN’T, YOU AIN’T OFF THE HOOK
BUT YOU FORGIVEN, LET’S TRY AND MAKE SOME
MEANINGFUL DECISIONS THIS LIFE YOU KNOW
YOU GONNA FIND SOMEONE AND THEY GONNA
TRY YOUR DAMN SOUL, TAKE YOUR TIME AND
MAKE SURE THEY WORTH THE FIGHT FOR
