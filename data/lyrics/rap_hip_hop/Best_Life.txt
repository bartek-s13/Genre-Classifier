I've been looking at her
Thinking about we
Running up cheques
Bloody on feet
Money like Jay
Looking like Bey
I know he want you, but he nothing like me
I've been looking at her
Thinking about we
Running up cheques
Bloody on feet
Money like jay
Dun nun nun dun nun nun
I've been living lavish
That's what i'm trying to say like

Fuck what you heard I
I've been out here living my best life
You know what it gets like
I've been out here living my best life
Fuck what you heard I
I've been out here living my best life
You know what it gets like
I've been out here living my best life

Beamers, coupes
So many tings I can't chose
Rockstar, I hit 21 savage
My yard, the bumberclart mood
Man said I would never be a baller
They should have said I will never be an athlete
Because if you heard what I made last quarter
You little fuckboys won't @ me
Yats want to come through so they don't freeze
Put them in a cab they don't squeeze
Hit them one time then both leave
Girls move Kway till we show keys, ahh
I use to do holidays in
Now its Hilton, seasons, Holidays inn
Last year I was bussing all of the mandem
This year it's a holiday ting

Fuck what you heard I
I've been out here living my best life
You know what it gets like
I've been out here living my best life
Fuck what you heard I
I've been out here living my best life
You know what it gets like
I've been out here living my best life

Yes i'm faded, faded (faded)
I've been on the wave i'm sailing (I've been on the wave)
Faded, faded (now were going to make it rain, oh, yes i'm)
Yes i'm faded, faded (faded)
I've been on the wave i'm sailing
Like da da da da da (da da da da da, da da)

Monday I never had a licence
Thursday I hopped in the Merc'
Five hundred miles on the weekend
Now we are doing skr, skr, skr
All  my niggas do dirt, dirt, dirt
Might get a Ri Ri so I can work, work, work
What we saying? Black men don't cheat
So I put it on a shirt, shirt, shirt
Rah, Now its hoods up when I want to get past
Girls come Croydon, I make em trek far
Caught brain first, that what? Head start
Left her man, that's foul, red card

Thinking about we
Running up cheques
Bloody on feet
Money like Jay
Dun-du-du dun-du-du day
I've been doing numbers
That's what i'm trying to say like

Fuck what you heard I
I've been out here living my best life
You know what it gets like
I've been out here living my best life
Fuck what you heard I
I've been out here living my best life
You know what it gets like
I've been out here living my best life

Yes i'm faded, faded (faded)
I've been on the wave i'm sailing (I've been on the waves)
Faded, faded (now were going to make it rain, oh, yes i'm)
Yes im faded, faded (faded)
I've been on the wave i'm sailing
