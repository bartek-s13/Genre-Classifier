Run up a check like Nike
Got all of my brothers
All of my hitters beside me
Run up a check like Nike
I'm like Michael Jordan
Everyone wanna be like me
Run up a check like Nike
Got all of my brothers
All of my hitters beside me
Run up a check like Nike
Run up a check
I'm super spectacular
Call a foreign bad girl
And I tell her to back it up
I count, I count I'm counting the money and stack it up
You wanna get it like me but too bad you weren't fast enough (HEY!)
I hop on the road and I ride
I got money to make, its the only thing that's on my mind
I got money to make, I continue to stay on my grind
I'm like Michael Jackson, thriller, In his prime
I'm like Michael Jackson, I'm bad
I'm like Michael Jackson, I got fans
I'm like Odell Beckham I'm a Superman
I hop in Instagram &amp; check on my DM's
Run up a check like Nike
Got all of my brothers
All of my hitters beside me
Run up a check like Nike
I'm like Michael Jordan
Everyone wanna be like me
Run up a check like Nike
Got all of my brothers
All of my hitters beside me
Run up a check like Nike
Run up a check
Florida soda
We in Pensacola
Keep variety like Noah
In the game
I don't carry a Controlla
Drake Hold up
Need to sell I gotta meet my Quota
I know the way I'm Yoda
Fast asleep in a coma
I don't ever Notice
My baby the Coldest
In the game I'm Coaching
I don't want emotions
Bend the earth erosion
I just devotion like the boys in motion
I just ate the game
Sorry, bonapatie'
Don't skip me in line
You go right after me
Hold up this is poppin, I guess we is gon have to see
Sorry for your loss, this is just a casualty
