(Intro / Hook)
I Cry and You Cry and We All Sick Of Trying
It's Nothing, Its Something
It's Nothing but Something
I Try and I Try and We Better Off Dying
We Fronting, We Bluffing, Just To Make Us Seem Tougher
(Verse 1)
I Need A Beautiful Women With Me
I Need Designer So I'm Feeling Neat
Said You Can't Price Me So I'm Feeling Free
Take It So Fast So I'm Feeling The Speed
I Need A Beautiful Women With Me
I Need Designer So I'm Feeling Neat
Said You Can't Price Me So I'm Feeling Free
Take It So Fast So I'm Feeling The Speed
Keep It 100 I'm Realest With You
Only on Nikki (Nicotine) So I'm Feeling Cool
Everyone Know When I Walk Into School
Everyone, Everyone, Everyone...
Everyone Acting Like Friends
Everyone Acting Like Friends
Oh, No No No Not Again
Oh, No No No Not Again
(Bridge / Outro)
Woah, Woah, You Not The Gang, Woah
Woah Woah, We Can Not Hang, Woah
No No, No, We Can Not Hang, We Can Not Hang
We Can Not Hang, No No No
