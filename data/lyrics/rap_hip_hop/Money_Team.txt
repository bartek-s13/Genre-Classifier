Friyie…
The Dollar……. The power……
VERSE #1
I been the man, (yeah )
They’re backing me cause I’m the package man
4 niggas 4 straps masked up
In an all black caravan
100 more like I’m Farrakhan
Creep up on like it's Pakistan
Type of shit to make you fear the man, yeah
I been the man!!
Give and go then I run it in
Ain't no circus I be juggling
10 toes gotta know what I do it for
Everyday I'm hustling
Slipping, why they stumbling
While I’m underground tunneling
Found an entrance now I’m coming in
They don’t want to see me coming in
Doing 80 in a 50 zone
Then I made a left on Cumberland
OT, on the hunt again
All the hundreds they be falling out the sky
End of winter till the summer end
Kick the door down, how you mean
Now the whole team coming in
Now the whole team coming in
I just want the riches
Know the lifestyle dangerous
But we only gon grow they be lying if they said it wouldn’t change us
But we always gon remain us
We gon never ever  change up
We gon never ever change up
We gon never ever change up heyy!!


CHORUS
Money money money money team (12x)
*(With adlibs)*
I'm a pull up on another scene
I ain't playing for no other team
Money money money money team (2x)
*(With adlibs)*
VERSE #2
Take it back when I was 17
Distribution like the Medellin
Take a look into my eyes
You can see the pain figure what I really mean
Mamma moved me out the hood
They can never take me from it, imma never leave
So I had to get the money team
Money money money money team!!
I remember it was all a dream
The Life we living it ain't what it seems
Floyd got me feeling like a Milli a Milli
Moonwalking like I’m Billie Jean
Southside finch, I done came up from the bottom
Of the bottom, look at me
Now a nigga on the money team
Money money money money team!!
Lately, I have been feelin' wonderful
All theses hundreds need a hundred more
On point got a ton in stock
Just a little what I got in store
Take a look at what the money do
Youngin’ I ain't even 22
Baby K hold 22
You can tell me what you want to do
But I really ain't into all the static
Leave the situation looking graphic
Automatic know that ill be more than happy
Poof gone, imma work the magic
More then happy imma make it happen
Innovator imma get it made
Paint a perfect picture anime
Ain't on Adelaide unless I’m getting paid
CHORUS
Money money money team (12x)
*(With adlibs)*
I'm a pull up on another scene
I ain't playing for no other team
Money money money money team (2x)
*(With adlibs)*
VERSE #3
They would of thought a nigga from Atlanta
But I’m cooling out in Caribana
Where your manners, nigga where your manners
All designer on me like I'm panda
In the cut, I'm sipping dirty Fanta
Wrap it up , I gift it , like I’m santa
HO HO , Slow do better than no dough, Hey Hey
In the booth I do the running man
I ain't stop until a hunned bandz
Understand I ain't a runner man
Money dance I do the money dance
100 bands I count 100 bands
In America,  The son of Sam
Man they say they really want it
But I realize that they don’t really want it man!

CHORUS
Money money money money team (12x)
*(With adlibs)*
Im a pull up on another scene
I ain't playing for no other team
Money money money money team (2x)
*(With adlibs)*
