Do better, who better? You better?
Been around, like hella propellers
Wanna know who you with, don't tell 'em
Come on, fellas, that ain't none of your biz'
Got on your bodysuit, you know I'm on your ass today
Would you let me hit it thrice if I asked today?
She know my stick nothing but magic, babe
I be swinging it back and forth, 'til you in your casket, bae, mm

Girl, you want my best side, mm
Bet she from the west side, mm
Mm

Now, I just wanna know
Don't you sugarcoat
I'll say it all if you want
Now, could you tell me like it is?
Pretty little fears
Music to my ears

Okay, say it loud, say it proud, you want it more
We open door, hit the couch, then the floor
I cut it up, like a scissor, love galore
She never bored, there's so much shit we can do
You free to say whatever, baby, if you asking me
No limit when I'm in it, got a Master P
I'm hoping I don't have a fast release
Got me focused like I'm out here tryna get my master's see, mm
Throwin' up the peace sign, hmm
Girl, I'm from the Eastside, mm
Mm
Girl, you on my best side, mm
Say she from the west side, mm
Mm

Now, I just wanna know
Don't you sugarcoat
I'll say it all if you want
Now, could you tell me like it is?

I'm loving your light, vulnerable
Letting your guard down, it's honorable
'Specially when the past ain't been that
Friendly to you, but there’s magic in that
You the flower that I gotta protect
And keep alive in the winter time, ayy, don't you die yet
You been way more than a friend of mine, we more like fam
I raise you, you raise me, let's turn this whole life 'round
You can confide in me
I could take the weight up off your shoulderblades
And try to store the pain inside of me
Ayy, why the world do you like that?
Like they don't know you God-sent, but me, I view you like that
I'm sneaking glances, thanking God that he drew you like that
Beautiful Black child, come and shed your black cloud
For your vibe and your smile, I don't mind a lil' rain
I'm your dog, ears perk up at the sound of your name
Count on your main, wildfire, can't handle your flame
Download your shame, wild high, come drown in your fragrance
You that red pill that a nigga found in the Matrix
Before I had you, this shit was fantasy
You plant a seed to grow some roots, a branch and leaves
Becomes a tree of life until our nights are filled
With peace from stress and strife
And that's the blessing that I get from wifing you
'Cause you entrusted me with the key to your heart
Beating you smart, 'cause even though I need a new start
Due to my past transgressions, you believed in me
I guess the light I see in you is what you see in me, Lord
Say she from the west side, mmm
And she see my best side, mmm
Mmm

Now, I just wanna know
Don't you sugarcoat
I'll say it all if you want
Now, could you tell me like it is?
