HOOK
Okay The sun don't shine everyday
The money don't last when you broke
I don't believe everything they say...
VERSE 1
My life is like the election (uh)
Fuck it man
It caint get too much worse than this
Well
At least I'm not in the back of a Hearst and shit
But honestly
Society
Got me fucked up
•
I look at everything
And in my head I scream what the fuck
How the fuck am posed to not go insane
These kids love they twitter handle
More than they last name
They wanna hop inside that coupe
And drive up in that fast lane
But they ain't never cut a yard
Or even cut they own main
Mayne
Whoops I think  I'm in my mind again
I'm smoking man
I'm tryna to find my way
The block is hot
I call it lil Wayne
Cuz now a days manyne
It just ain't the same
Aye!
You could lose your life on the block there
Or get trapped and raise ya baby
On welfare
Or work a retail job
Escape hell for a while
While you contemplate
Why this is your life now
Or you could boss up
And chase them dollars
Fix yo family
•
Escape yo prollums
Yeah
That's the kinda shit I'm own
Fuck yo opinions
Bitch I'm grown
Look..
HOOK
The sun don't shine everyday
The money don't last when you broke
I don't believe everything they say...

VERSE 2
Yeah
I brought the heater
For my people
At the steeple
Smoking weed and playing FIFA
On they college campuses
Losing sleep
And barely eatin'
They gon hit ya phone
And
Tell you that you need to
Open up yah YouTube
U gotta see this new dude
He edify my soul
Like a nigga got some new shoes
He tell me shit like
•
They don't run the world
You do
So make sure evrrybody in ya circle
Running wit you
Ya life is like ya car
It will do whatever you choose
Caint nobody make you do shit
This ain't voodoo
Let me show you how to
Operate in this new school
Never let a nigga try to violate or use u
•
Keep a dark side for these hoes
Like dooku

I lost a friend last year I'm in a new mood
Staying in my room
And  ever talking to you new dudes
Weird as fuck
Homie
I don't wanna know what you do
•
I ain't talked to my dad
In a minute I'm tryna stay coo
•
In the bay where niggas hate
If they don't ever make it out
Maybe that's why this shit so hard
And no one ever makes it out
Maybe that's why my favorite
Rapper dropped an album
That was classic
But it didn't get blastted
Cuz it lacked more slaps
•
Then I dropped
Shit changed
New sound
New wave
I was like A.I
I went and changed the whole game
Never once did they give credit
To the sport they now play
And now I lay in my room
With this joint everyday
I'm just asking for minimal stress
And peace in my mental
•
I'm blessed
But knowing I'm living with less
And that is the issue
•
In fact I'll grab you some tissue
And tell you stories
U wish you had never heard
Or had witnessed
You never would want to have lived with
Like when they pulled out a pistol
And pointed it at my friend
No explanation for it
They just pulled the trigger on him
And word got back to his friends
And it got back to his mamma
The thought of seeing her crying
Could prolly give you bad karma
The thought of being a victim
My best friend got a daughter
If something happen to him
She gon face this life with no father
This shit is really real
Like really really fucking real for me
I put in all this fucking work
Still there ain't no deal for me
It's a possibility that if Idont blow lyrically
They'll pull me over
Ask me for my name
And end up killing me
I know this shit is new to you
But for me it's like a trilogy
That's throwing off my energy
So I just turn to the beat
Thankful that it ain't the street
Keep my feelings on discreet
Mobbing thru this industry
Never changing who I am
Chasing what I'm finna be
Doomed like the Kennedy's
Hated like a killer bee
Fighting all that bullshit
A lion heart got into me
I got love for everyone but yet I still got enemies
