How dem a gwan like me nuh hungry before
How dem a gwan like me nuh stumble before
You haffi mek it when you humble fi sure
Crysp inna cup and a nuh rum me a pour
How dem a gwaan like say me born inna riches
A weh dem deh when man a sleep pon the floor?
But from me born me say me gone fi the riches
Mummy nuh worry, me can't dead poor

Nothing nah gwaan and the pussy dem switch up
Nuff a mi gyal dem bun me before
But ask inna the place weh mi born jah
War start, me never run weh before
And even when me rolling to the party
Haffi bring da gun deh fi sure
Dem woulda love fi see you pon the asphalt
Nuh waan fi see we young and a tour
It's like badmind a kill dem pussy deh
And you need fi hunt fi the cure
Cause every time another youth rise up
A that bring you down to the floor
How dem a gwan like me nuh hungry before
How dem a gwan like me nuh stumble before
You haffi mek it when you humble fi sure
Crysp inna cup and a nuh rum me a pour
How dem a gwaan like say me born inna riches
A weh dem deh when man a sleep 'pon the floor?
But from me born me say me gone fi the riches
Mummy nuh worry, me can't dead poor

And man a soldier, so me get a ruff life
We just a warm up, yo, we ready fi the fight
Water commission, know a pressure buss pipe
A turn it up and a ch-cheddar must right
A bredda man haffi see weather just like u
So when you see me inna the leather, don't badmind
Me work hard, me never badmind you
Look weh hard work gi' me nobody nuh kind so
Roll out
Vroom!
Crysp inna cup (yeah)
Gyal 'pon the front seat, you know a dick she a suck
One bag a fake love, but mi nuh miss when mi bruk
From me family good and mi bredda dem up
How dem a gwan like me nuh hungry before
How dem a gwan like me nuh stumble before
You haffi mek it when you humble fi sure
Crysp inna cup and a nuh rum me a pour
How dem a gwaan like say me born inna riches
A weh dem deh when man a sleep 'pon the floor?
But from me born me say me gone fi the riches
Mummy nuh worry, me can't dead poor
