I know you know I know (you know I do)
I know you know I know (damn)
I know you know I know (skeesh skeesh skeesh)
I know I know (knew it)
I know you know I know (now you heard)
I know you know I know (you know I do)
I know you know I know (skeesh, skeesh,skeesh)
I know I know

Yeah yeeaaahh
I know you know that I'm busy
Two phones and both of them ringin'
I fly these hoes to the city
Not showing them off just pity
My new girl look like a xenophobe
I know that she know I know
Fuck up my thirty eight credit score
Hit it for a week and I let it go
You know I'm right
See it in your eyes
I know you're close
Blowing up my phone
I know you know that I'm
Fuck - whatever

I know you know you know I know (you know I do)
I know you know you know I know (damn)
I know you know you know I know (skeesh skeesh skeesh)
I know you know you know I know (now you heard)
I know you know I know (skeesh, skeesh,skeesh)
I know I know
