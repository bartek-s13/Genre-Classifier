I'm falling again (I'm falling again)
Falling again (I'm falling again)
She's calling again (She's calling again)
It fucks with my head (She's calling again)

Falling again just like oh-oh
Think it's the end of the road
Anxiety make me loco
Depression eat up my soul
And she love it when I geek, ooh, ooh
I know she can't take the heat, ooh, ooh
Demons jumped me in a fleet, ooh, ooh
Sorry baby I can't keep you
Time and time I tried to teach you
Life ain't easy ain't no pre-school
Took some drugs felt like I need to
Hoping they don't get to me, ooh
Wishing that I couldn't see, ooh
Hey be quiet or they'll sleep you
Did this shit without a team, ooh
It ain't nobody I'll feed, ooh
Falling again it's man down
Hit her again, we go round after round
Thought that they left but they came back around
She don't want that so she left me to drown
I'm falling again (I'm falling again)
Falling again (I'm falling again)
She's calling again (She's calling again)
It fucks with my head (She's calling again)
