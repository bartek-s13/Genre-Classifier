Bad to the bone
She bad to the bone
Bad and you know
Let's go, let's go
Go, let's go, oh, oh
Let's go, let's go, yeah
Let's go, let's go

I just rolled my weed, now I'm back in the zone
I'm fuckin' with lil' shawty and she bad to the bone
I know them haters, they be mad that I'm on
'Cause I just keep winnin' and all these bands gettin' long
She don't care if I'm right or I'm wrong
Pourin' Hennessy, we catch a lil' vibe to the song (Yeah)
All these sunsets, she ridin' alone
When I look around, I see lil' baby winin' alone

I'm back and I'm better, now what you tellin' me?
I just make friends with enemies of the enemy
Ain't nobody with me that never commit felony
I'm smokin' on the star, that Cali, it be the remedy
All my old bitches regretting that they don't mess with me
Gettin' to the money, I told 'em I got the recipe
See the police, investigation is stressin' me
And I don't fuck with niggas and bitches who full of jealousy (No way)
They told me they with me and they was lyin'
I bet they wanna be friends, now we shinin'
I told 'em way back then, give me time, and
Now look at the money I spend on these diamonds
All of them nights I spent, I was grindin'
All of them night I searched, I wasn't finding
Then I go get it, I got the money on my mind
Everyday hustlin' like I'm runnin' out of time, yeah

I just rolled my weed, now I'm back in the zone
I'm fuckin' with lil' shawty and she bad to the bone
I know them haters, they be mad that I'm on
'Cause I just keep winnin' and all these bands gettin' long
She don't care if I'm right or I'm wrong
Pourin' Hennessy, we catch a lil' vibe to the song (Yeah)
All these sunsets, she ridin' alone
When I look around, I see lil' baby winin' alone

Twenty deep, I'm back up in the building
I'm back like I'm a villain, my stack is never chillin'
On my own way, spittin' the crack since the beginning
And on track to hundred milli', why you back in your feelings?
She wanna go on dates with me, yeah, just gotta pass
The life that I was livin', I just left in the past
Shut it down on the set, you know I'm trap, you were close
And she be teasin' but I'ma chose this bread over us
I'm fast to get the check, I never settle for less
I came up from the bottom, I was servin' the press
All these hoes on me, my lil' baby, she stressed out
Creases in her body and she wanna be pressed out (Yeah)
And everybody tryna hold them somethin'
But we be fuckin' on the Sunday, that holy cum, yeah
Tell them niggas they don't owe me none'
'Cause when I left behind mine, they didn't show no love

I just rolled my weed, now I'm back in the zone
I'm fuckin' with lil' shawty and she bad to the bone
I know them haters, they be mad that I'm on
'Cause I just keep winnin' and all these bands gettin' long
She don't care if I'm right or I'm wrong
Pourin' Hennessy, we catch a lil' vibe to the song (Yeah)
All these sunsets, she ridin' alone
When I look around, I see lil' baby winin' alone
I just rolled my weed, now I'm back in the zone
I'm fuckin' with lil' shawty and she bad to the bone

'Cause I just keep winnin' and all these bands gettin' long
She don't care if I'm right or I'm wrong
Pourin' Hennessy, we catch a lil' vibe to the song (Yeah)
All these sunsets, she ridin' alone

Bad to the bone
She bad to the bone
Bad and you know
Let's go, let's go
Go, let's go, oh, oh
Let's go, let's go, yeah
