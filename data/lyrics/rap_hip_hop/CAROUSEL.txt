<<<<<<< HEAD
That is all
You know? It's a routine with some of these, man

Little girl, bring fire from her world
I'm trying, I'm lost, only murmur
Stay in for the summer

Stay in for the summer and while six feet under
And I kept that number, call her, call her
Keep falling, falling, like
Carousel, known to raise hell like I'm Tyrion
In chain mail, gimme head, tails, see the jaw drop
Face melt, like a basehead, Libra scale, balance both sides
And she do it well, so well, so well, yeah
Rain man, ducking from the sun, doing okay then?
All these feelings bottled inside like a house dog
Bounty on the outlaw, should get out the house more
Playing off the foul ball, you could stick around

Little girl, bring fire from her world
I'm trying, I'm lost, only murmurs
Find time, yeah, find time
Unsure, I'm lying, stay in for the summer
Little girl, bring fire from her world
I'm trying, I'm lost, only murmurs
Find time, find time, if she's unsure
Find time, stay in for the summer

Quiet, lonely, nobody told me, drifting aside, yeah, running away
Soon as you got those new Nikes
Soon as you got those new Nikes
Busy cutting the checks, I'm used to cutting the ties, okay
Pull up your pants, okay
Remember them rolling eyes, now they're all fans, okay
Hanging from grapevines, she want the juice now
She want it all, right, get it from you now (Get it from you now)
Little girl, drifting aside, drifting aside

Call her, call her, keep falling, falling, like-
Carousel, on the same ride, we're on the same
We're on the same ride, we're on the same ride
We're on the same

Little girl, bring fire from her world
I'm trying, I'm lost, only murmurs
Find time, find time, if she's unsure
Find time, stay in for the summer
Yeah, yeah
