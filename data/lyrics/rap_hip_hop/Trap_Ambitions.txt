(Hook-Trapperman Dale)
Aye, yeah I got them racks in them shoe box
Aye hold on, lil mama I'm too hot
Them ? in the hood, I won't do nothing
Quarter brick solid white, call it clue clucks
62 cutlass with new guts, I won't fuck on that bitch she do too much
And I'm in the game, I'm too up
Bought my bitch Louie V, boo'd up
Little bitch I got shooters on my roster, money and power I'm walking with 4 choppas
Just sold a pound, just check my 4 pockets
Racks on me now, nigga no wallet
Still selling blow, yeah they know about it
Pull up and pop at your cap, nigga no problem
I want the cash nigga no staling
Just dropped a dog in your projects
Just dropped it off check my 4 pockets, 125 out the door nigga we ballin
Callin up street like you seen about it, 223 so up the streets nigga we bout it
(Chorus-Trapperman Dale)
Hmm you ca call me what you want, just don't call the police
I've been breaking down a Russian Cream, stuffin it with OG, lowkey
9 times out of 10 bet ya bitch she know me
I've been in the trap eye ballin, if its over keep it you don't owe, dough please
I done always been a ambitions little trap nigga

Even im up in the kitchen, know I'm standing right here in the trap with it
Let me tell yall about the ambitious of a trap nigga
(Verse 1-Trapperman Dale)
Hit the trap I'm stuffing ounces, in little baby lap nigga
Lost it all, I got it back quicker, we was raised different check the stats nigga
Big bitch call her pack stiffer, big body benz brought the sack with her
40 cal, got it deeped cocked, for a pussy nigga that got ? with us
I got codeine in my Fanta, I don't know w just run up the armor hammer
I been tryna dodge the slammer, in and out of rentals, in and out the pantry
In and out your bitch, petty she ain't got a dime, I just like her naked
I just like to see you panic, I just made a dime pullin out of heelys
(Chorus-Trapperman Dale)
Hmm you can  call me what you want, just dont call the police

I've been in the trap eye ballin, if its over keep it you don't owe, dough please
I done always been a ambitions little trap nigga

And I'm in the game, I'm too up
