(No sad days in L.A.)
(In L.A., in L.A.)
No sad, no bad
No sad, no bad

No sad, no bad days in L.A. (In L.A., in L.A.)
I'ma sail the seven seas just to separate myself from the fakes (Fakes)
No sad, no bad days in L.A. (In L.A., in L.A.)
So many days alone on the road, it was all worth the wait (Worth the wait, worth the wait)
No sad, no bad days in L.A. (No days, no days, no days, yeah)

You was waiting (Yeah), I was chasing
Stomping out the store, Gucci bracelet (Yeah, what? What?)
No hesitation (What?), what's the hold up? (What?)
Flyin' in a foreign, doing donuts (Skrrt)
Watched my whole life change like a movie
First day in L.A., a hundred groupies (What? What? What? Yeah)
My shorty in the ends afraid to lose me (Lose me)
They gon' say I changed but I never changed
I just bought a chain, fuck a wedding ring (Yeah)
Big body Range, pull up in a tank (Tank)
Talking down my name, we gon' let it bang
They gon' claim they gang, they ain't really gang (Gang)
