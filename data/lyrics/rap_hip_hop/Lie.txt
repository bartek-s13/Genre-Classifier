Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Yeah

Going crazy living my life all inside my head
I got lost inside this cup I can’t even find my head
Demons pop out all up on me like a drive by yeah
When she asking me how I’m doin' I just like yeah
Saw the signs like yeah
Lost my mind right there
Want some love from me?
You won’t find that there
Put her trust in me
Waste her time right there
When she ask me how I’m doin' I just lie like yeah

I should’ve assumed that shit wouldn’t work yeah
It get difficult you like a whole different person
I’m addicted to you I don’t think it could worsen
Now I’m numbin' my mind, to leave from this earth yeah
Get my shit together before I fold
Really I do better when I’m alone
I could change the weather my heart so cold
Don’t wanna burn forever please save my soul
Sit here all alone I don’t got no homie's
I can’t ever trust a bitch cause they always wanna hoe me
If you want this shit to work all you gotta do is show me
It’s whatever I don’t care I do better on my lonely
I been smokin' so much gas now I’m really starting to panic
Heart is beating fast, I lost feeling in my hands
Now it’s all up in the air I just really hope I land it
Ima grip this cup till I find my edge, oh
Going crazy living my life all inside my head
I got lost inside this cup I can’t even find my head
Demons pop out all up on me like a drive by yeah
When she asking me how I’m doin' I just like yeah
Saw the signs like yeah
Lost my mind right there
Want some love from me?
You won’t find that there
Put her trust in me
