Verse 1
They said come on down to the place where you can find/
All the pretty little girls &amp; the fine expensive wine/
Said this is how you live the life/
In the fast lane, with the big chains/
And the fast cars. Yeah -they lying to ya/
They luke warm - they tryina screw ya/
Don't let em have your soul/
Don't let em take your soul/
Hold on, hold on
Chorus
Hot or cold, which would you rather be/
Don't play the middle baby. You're drifting out to sea/
All alone, on your own/
And you left your life jacket in the drawer by the bed back at home/
Verse 2
Uh eh yo hot or cold/
Tell me what I gotta do to save your soul/
Tell me what I gotta do to make you whole/
I know you out there filling really broken, open/
Hopin' on a shooting star/
Praying to the Lord that He'll meet you where you are/
Praying to the one father &amp; son/
Holy spirit come on in I don't wanna run/
Cause I am on the run. I am so lost/
Is there really any meaning in the wooden cross/
Is there really any power in the fathers name/
And if there is why is it so hard for me to change/
Feelin' like i'm hot, feelin' like i'm cold/
I'm standing in the middle while they tuggin' at my soul/
But this is my time, I don't care how/
Lord I surrender, save me now
Chorus
Hot or cold, which would you rather be/
Don't play the middle baby. You're drifting out to sea/
All alone, on your own/
And you left your life jacket in the drawer by the bed back at home/
Verse 3
Eshon Burgundy
What's the temperature of ya soul/
Sinister prime minister thinking something cold/
Or like Jeremiah you and Messiah got something strong/
And His word alone is like fire shut up in ya bones/
Huh? What up? I'm hailing from buck town/
And shots are ringing out so you probably should duck now/
Especially if you don 't know if you got hit where you would go/
Take a sip of h2o in spit it out and let me
Chorus
Hot or cold, which would you rather be/
Don't play the middle baby. You're drifting out to sea/
All alone, on your own/
And you left your life jacket in the drawer by the bed back at home/
