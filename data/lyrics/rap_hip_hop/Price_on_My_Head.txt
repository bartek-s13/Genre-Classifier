Yeah, I pull up to my town with a price on my head
I pull up to my town, I'm outside
They wanna see me drown, it’s on sight's what they said
I heard these niggas want to take my life
I don't apologize, I would die for this shit
I don’t apologize, I don't hide
I'm Kubrick with the shine, got the ice on my neck
They wanna throw a bag on him

Price on my head, got a price on my head
Night when I rest, with a knife by my bed
I'm so paranoid, I'ma sleep when I'm dead
I'm so paranoid, I'ma sleep when I’m dead
Price on my head, got a price on my head (Price on my head)
Night when I rest, with a knife by my bed (Knife by my bed)
I’m so paranoid, I'ma sleep when I’m dead (When I'm dead)
I'm so paranoid, I'ma sleep when I’m dead

I cut off all my side hoes, in du Cap with a dime though
All these girls been ran through, on the low real snipe mode
I can't sleep, that's insomnia, so much ice like I'm Tonya
All my boys livin' debt free, your squad like Wesley
I want head on a jet ski, she gave me head for a Fendi
For a Prada, she got sexy, for a Lambo or a Bentley
My mansion is no joke, house party like 1 OAK
Weed louder than gun smoke, get high off one toke
You beefin' with yourself, tell the truth
Niggas on your side, they would ride for me too
Still wasting they time, tryna come for me too
I'm too busy, faded in Japan with the crew
With the crew, with the crew, with the crew
Shout out all the girls who've been riding for me too
Niggas want me dead, I've been dead, nothing new
Niggas want me dead, for a bag and a

They tried to get me and they missed, if we send shots then they gon' hit
I could get your top taken off for less than a quarter brick (Yeah)
One of my rings could get him off, we'll check him off the list
My shooter a codeine addict, he'll do it for a pint of Actavis
Since I met Cash, got a lot of racks, I still want more (Racks)
I can tell by the way you carry yourself, you never sold no dope (Dope)
Growin' up, my mama beat my ass, then cleaned my mouth with soap (Soap)
Now she showin' up to work in a Balenciaga coat
Price on my head, got your life 'round my neck
Put a brown kid in the Southside Rex and me is what you'll get
My block was like the car wash, you drive in, you gon' get wet
Had take a lot of losses, made me comfortable with death (Death)
Took too much Act', had to pop a Xan to reset
His bitch gave me some top, and now he wanna send me threats
Live my best life, I know my opps just wanna see me dead
Took his life, I paid him double what they put on my head
