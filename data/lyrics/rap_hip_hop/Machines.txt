We hold onto the lies to feel free
So shackled by smiles, so empty
We're scared of the war so we've forgotten who we are
We've traded in hope for safety
We're raised in the smoke
Insisting that we're all too tired for light the fire and shake the earth
But if all we are is just machines
Let's become a miracle and break free from these chains
We must be more than just machines
So let them hear our hearts
So let them hear our hearts
So let them hear our hearts
So let them hear our hearts
Where will you run, when there's no place left for you to hide?
When you're faced with the flood
Will you stand for the future and swallow your pride?
Where will you run? Will you run?
Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one who dares to dream
I scream at the top of my lungs
I hope that I'm proven wrong
But if all we are is just machines
Let's become a miracle and break free from these chains
We must be more than just machines
So let them hear our hearts
So let them hear our hearts
Where will you run, when there's no place left for you to hide?
When you're faced with the flood
Will you stand for the future and swallow your pride?
Where will you run?
When there's no place left for you to hide?
When you're faced with the flood
(When you're faced with the flood)
Will you stand for the future and swallow your pride?
If all we are is just machines
Then we must be the cogs inside the wheels of change
We must be more than just machines
We can't afford to hide, we must embrace the pain
If all we are is just machines
Then we must be the cogs inside the wheels of change
We must be more than just machines
We can't afford to hide, we must embrace the pain
Where will you run, when there's no place left for you to hide?
When you're faced with the flood
Will you stand for the future and swallow your pride?
