Sorry, but it's all part of the game
Dog eat dog world, blame or be blame

Sell my soul, I won't ever be the same, (No, I won't)
Counting down the days to 21
If you leave me, then you better fucking run (Better run)
I don't care (I don't care)
What you want from me (No, no)
Smoking all this weed (Yeah, I'm smoking all this weed)
If you hate me then just leave (Bitch, get the fuck out)
