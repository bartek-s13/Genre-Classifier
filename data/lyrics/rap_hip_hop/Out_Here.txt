Now the street is calming down
But the street will never rest
And the arrow points to you
You're too much
The strangers you knew
Couldn't ever have wanted you
I told you so
I have to push them away
I wanna see you comin' in
Wanna see you on the run
When the end is so new
The rise and fall
For 23 years
I'm the one that wanted you
I kept you close
And now I can prove it
Out here
We can never go
Out here
It's for real and we don't make it up
Now I feel it wearing off
But the feeling will never rest
So what did you have to lose?
It's the way you thought
According to you
They will never chase you down
They're way too slow
You say that you're stronger
I wanna see you comin' in
Wanna see you on the run
When the end is so new
The rise and fall
For 23 years
I'm the one that wanted you
I kept you close
And now I can prove it
Out here
We can never go
Out here
It's for real and we don't make it up
If we go back now
It's a long way down
It's a long way down
It's a long way
If you doubt me now
It's a long way down
It's a long way down
It's a long way
I wanna see you comin' in
Wanna see you on the run
When the end is so new
The rise and fall
For 23 years
I'm the one that wanted you
I kept you close
And now I can prove it
Out here
We can never go
Out here
