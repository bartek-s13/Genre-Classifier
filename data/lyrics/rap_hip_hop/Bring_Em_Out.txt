Bring Em Out
All of that money you scream about
All of this drip that you sing about
Talking that shit you must dream about
All of these bricks and all of these sticks
And all of that shit that you sing about
Talking that shit, nigga leave it out
We've had enough nigga, bring 'em out, bring 'em out

Said I love this shit (love it)
Just the other day it was trap more nigga I was tripping out a busted whip
But we coming with a busted drip
Said the drip's so saucy
Said they're coming like a mustard dip
Don't slip, don't trip
Guaranteed you get (uh!)
Got four and a bit
Put another nine and a four and a bit
Now you're bringing back more than a bit
Bush and Sus in the trap that's mad
Now you're bringing back more than a hit
Got more than your man, 'cause I do more than you think

And we do more than bits
Bankroll more than a lick
Anything I touch gets licked
And still stuff corn in clips
And if I bring 'em out, bring 'em out
It's gon 'cause some shit
Shots all ringing out, niggas dipping out, better hide your kids
And you better hide your bitch

Got the gyallie tryna line their wigs
Man are tryna buy them drinks
But they wanna vibe with us
They don't wanna vibe with pricks
All of my niggas take risks

And why you think these girls is here?
More than 100 bands on me
Why you think they on my dick?
