Today, Junior

The trap like a drive-thru
Up-sell, they don't know unless you tell 'em, man, I'm yellin', "Fuck 12"
They can't hold me in the county, nigga, I'ma make bail
Everything must go, everything must sell
I don't trust shit but my gun and my scale
Snitch or go to jail, let me pick my cell
My team undefeated, I ain't switchin' personnel
If you really talkin' numbers I can ship it in the mail (In the mail)

Young nigga got more money than your big homie
And my nigga got a .40 with a dick on it
I'm respected, I ain't gotta have a stick on me
But I still walk around with a brick on me

Stayed down, know this shit take time
Catch a case if a nigga ever try to take mine
All my niggas eatin' 'cause we got the same grind
Catchin' plays in the Rover while she give me FaceTime
I've been workin', I ain't worried 'bout no enemies
I'ma make a killin' when they drop it down to ten a ki'
I've been havin' shit, I know you niggas envy me
Bein' broke'll make you sick and bitch I got the remedy
You goin' out sad 'bout a bitch
And I been at my bag gettin' rich, I'm Money Making Mitch
I remember we was fastin' for this
So I'll give my last to the clique, we havin' this shit
And I prefer the ass over tits
Never lovin', I'm just smashin' the bitch, but we gotta make it quick
I hate it when she naggin' and shit
But I love it when she gag on the dick, she nasty as shit
