(Hook)
Look in my lobby
Yeah I'm stupid rich
(stupid rich)
Rari's and bugattie's
Yeah I'm stupid rich
(stupid rich)
Jacob on my wrist
Yeah I'm stupid rich
(stupid rich)
But all the money in the world can't satisfy this itch
Diamonds on my diamonds
Yeah I'm stupid rich
(stupid rich)
Islands on my islands
Yeah I'm stupid rich
(stupid rich)
Audemors and cigars
Yeah I'm stupid rich
(stupid rich)
But all the money in the world can't satisfy this itch
Verse 1 (Fr33 Tha Sinner)
Castle in the sky now I'm stupid rich
Ain't gone lie boy you know I'm  new to this
So u could Babel on (Babylon) how u moving bricks
I'm posted with the Plug team balling like we hoopin it
Bron flow
Got that heat
Alonzo
New God flow
See I'm Fresh prince
Ya'll Alfonso
Hit after hit
That's a combo
Ape
Like its the Congo
In the summer
We was ducking drummers
That's them bongo
Living on prayer that's that Bon Jov
Walking by faith like my eyes close
Was ducking 5. 0
Moving halves get it wholesale like it was costos
Chicken and them waffles
Crib was like its Roscoes
Head up in the Cosmos
No cran or no vodka
It's a hood Passover
Want the Jews and the matza
Haters quick to NV
Like the hometown Nevada
Now we with the KING of the city
Meet us in the plaza
What up
Hook
Verse 2 (Fr33 Tha Sinner)
You don't understand being stupid Rich
Feeling like the man with a Stupid chick
She ain't got a brain but she stuper thick
Boy the lawyer Jewish best believe I'll get ya shooter hit
Dark world we super lit
Vamp life
Get ya crucifix
Raise the steaks
U could a choose a dish
Prince of thieves
U could use a lick
Moving keys
Or the 2 for 6
Move they lips
And they kill for bills
That's a uma flick
Wanna tax I
So u better watch who u uber with
Show they A like a lunar clipse
And we came up
And changed up
Got ya change up
De range truck
U crazy can't bang with us
Can't hang with us
We dangerous
The snakes I crush
They can taste the  chucks
That's angel dust
Chains and cuffs
Got u tangled up
Dancing with Wolves u mangled up
And u came for what ?
To be allstars and bangled up
Got stripes like bangldush
Wrist to wrist
We ankled up
For the One that came for us
Red wine ain't grape enuff
So all this bread we breaking up
We breaking yeah
(Drew Smith )
Now catch the rap the foul of the air
Got my check poking out like I'm from the bel air
Ashton grey is the Chevy Impala
Philly raised I'm the man as I'm popping my collar
Man I need me some collards
That grande Texas not Austin but in need of powers
Not a coward but I'm cautious don't wanna be flowered
Making plays up in these streets you deny peace
Your life in here ain't promised check the hand on your time piece
