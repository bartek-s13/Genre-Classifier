You seem lost
Which looks different than someone who is wandering
Feel like I've seen it all at least once
Been on this world before
This is not me getting on, this is just me getting on again

I learned some things bout lettin' go
I learned to swing the metronome
I'll tell ya time is not money
I know, so much it's getting old
I learned you gotta stretch to grow
I heard you talk the rest is show
Can't tell you all they jocked from me
I turn around invent some more
I turned 19, I turned the page
I left the stage, I left my home
Nobody prayed to god for me
I heard the call just checked my phone

I'm old, I'm not new to this
Young, I keep 'em glued to this
Broke, but I'll be stupid rich
Broke, but I'll be stupid rich
I'm old, but I'm young
I'm broke, but I'm rich
I'm old, but I'm young
I'm broke, but I'm rich
I'm old, but I'm young
I'm broke, but I'm rich
I'm old, but I'm young
I'm broke, but I'm rich

I'm old in my soul, young like I'm royalish
Broken like bones but rich like the soil is
My how I've grown, watch me, I'm minding my tone
You lost me I'm finding my zone, I did this all on my own

There there sweetheart, I know times seem hard
We're very close, but like old leaning trees we know
That light beats dark
I left pages of your journal in my dorm room drawers
I learned I can't draw solace from ink stained parchment no more, I
Got sick of sleepin' on floors
I gotta go get my own I'm sick of borrowing yours, I

Young, but I'm tired, I feel old, 'cause I know more
I'ma get this dough, what you think I just went broke for?
People that I know, think they know themselves they're so sure
22 years old with a life they'd sell they souls for
Got it on my own, cracked the code
Stayin' on my toes, like I'm stationed in the zone
Can't pick up my phone, only distant 'cause I'm close
You'll have what it takes when you've given it the most
Kept goin', failed, fell hard
Know how I'm put together, 'cause I picked myself apart
(I'm old, I'm old, I'm old)
(There there sweetheart)
I'm old, but I'm young
I'm broke, but I'm rich
(I know times seem hard)
I'm old, but I'm young
I'm broke, but I'm rich
(We're very close)
I'm old, but I'm young
I'm broke, but I'm rich
(But like old leaning trees we know)
I'm old, but I'm young
I'm broke, but I'm rich
(That light beats dark)

I'm old in my soul, young like I'm royalish
Broken like bones but rich like the soil is
My how I've grown, watch me, I'm minding my tone
You lost me I'm finding my zone, I did this all on my own
