69 Manor Road, Sunday morning
Dorothy be up but Jennifer be yawning
Rachel a get her hair braided, I spoil it
One side be looking like Don King, don't it?
Ribs in the oven, catch a whiff
Heartless Crew on Mission, catch a crisp biscuit, whoa
Ice cream van, yeah, chase it down
Screwball, 99 Flake et al
Newham Leisure Centre where the girls at
Hair gelled down to her face where the curls at
Money on the table, Frustration, get mummy's purse out
Forward some summers, I'm racing the latest Merc out, it worked out
'Cept Everton's locked up, but we don't talk about it
Lee and Karys don't speak, and things ain't cool with Aaron
But amongst all the bullshit, it's love though
You've gotta love London in the sun, bro, ya dun know

That's what we call T-shirt weather in the manor, my friend
There's nuttin' like T-shirt weather in the manor, my friend
The Gs come out when the sun goes in
There something 'bout T-shirt weather in the manor, my friend

Barbecue all day, you're in the garden
Breezer and Alizé, get the party starting
Gyaldem be loving my TNs, jheeze
Back it up and whine pon mi den, peak
DJ got the Tina Moore and MJ Cole
The olders asking for some Dennis Brown but then you got
That one elder that wants to be young
Dancing on the floor to hype funk
The mood switches when the sun goes in
And birthday boy's mum goes in
Rudeboys pull up in the Bimmer, yes
What's that smell? That ain't cigarette
Neighbours'll complain to get the party locked off
Just to rain on our parade, but then a younger sprays
CS gas, everybody run, bro
You've gotta love the city in the sun, bro, ya dun know

That's what we call T-shirt weather in the manor, my friend
There's nuttin' like T-shirt weather in the manor, my friend
The Gs come out when the sun goes in
There something 'bout T-shirt weather in the manor, my friend

And it could all change in a minute, I've seen innocent summers turn sinister
Tempers flare up, violence is imminent
Especially post fit but you know the Streets video
Here we go, it was all good just a week ago
Seems like yesterday we was one people
Ten man onstage back to back, bare reloads
Ayia Napa weather, quarter lengths
They say the globe's warm and it's getting hot in the ends
That's when you swap the tees for the vests, but I'm talking kevlar
Cause things just ain't cool anymore
And bricks might ruin your door, trust dem youts anymore
Never Super Soaker 2000s don't shoot anymore
My deal got signed so the spirits all up
We shot the album front cover up by the shops
We just wanna rep the manor right, give it props
But some bredders run up on man, rah, the beef was on
So same night, shots fired, it weren't even man that did it
Buss a man but ride for man and take it where I didn't envisage
Now I've got big time crooks calling the house like "what is it?"
If we need to put in work, say the word and it's finished
Man just wanna make an album, mind my business
All this gangster shit, who wants to sleep with the fishes?
Success has a price and it's pretty
Penny for your thoughts and they'll try make you split it
They say the ends love you, then they hate you, then they love you again
Then you try change your postcode to W10
Grow apart, fall out of love with your friends
They'll say fame made you change but it's just all them
Some of them get cat, some of them go pen
Send mi likkle VO, gwan sit with them
Send them one two creps and Ralph Lauren
While they build up this picture that I'm 50 Cent
Rah, Kano's your darg, when you land, you're blessed
And these times, I ain't even blessed Jen
Now they all wanna come on tour but that's per DMs
Guest list, me plus thirty men
I buy the same Mr Whippy 99
But now I've got just as much problems and a flake ain't one
Friends turned snakes overnight
Cause they think I can take away their problems all with one hit song
But I just want the summer back how it used to be
When Nanan had us eating toffee apples by the sea
Or when we wore Moschino and were moving off key
When our chips were down, they weren't beefing 'bout Ps
The purest summers were those in the 90s
'05 changed my life forever, it's bittersweet
I've been riding that wave, still waters run deep
No sand in the ends, still life is a beach
And that's T-shirt weather in the manor, my friend
There's nuttin' like it
'05 shit
