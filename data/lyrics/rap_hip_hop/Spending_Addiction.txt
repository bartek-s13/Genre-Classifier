Yeah, ride the 'Vette or the Maybach, depend on my mood
More bookings and payments that shit done got huge (Shit done got huge)
Hop in the spaceship, take it to the moon (Gone)
Chrome Hearts on my face just to help me look cool (Yeah)
Her pussy stay wet, we don't gotta use lube (Lube)
Good head on her shoulders like she still in school (Uh)
Pour fours in my soda, I won't catch a flu
Loyalty mandatory, you part of this crew (Part of this crew)
Spending addiction, ten thousand on shoes (Spending addiction)
Spend with no limit, a hundred on jewels (A hundred on jewels)
Too many bitches, they coming in twos
I took a Perc', I been itching since noon (Itching since noon)
Why the brokest the loudest in the room? (Loudest)
Why all the sudden niggas want to be cool? (Want to be cool)
Ain't giving second chances, I'm no fool (Nah)
I'm out my depression, life been going smooth

Bonds in my session, backend through the roof
You gon' make some money, book me for a show
Most of my classmates thought I was a joke
Now look at their faces, I done gave 'em hope
Blue Phantom, I'm like I need me one of those
I built my name up to help the business grow
She freaky, pulled up without no pantyhose
I'm stacking these benjamins, try not to boast
Bought some exclusive drip on Melrose
Fuck the judge, gave my cousin elbow
Locked him up, put him in a hellhole
They hope that he rotting out in mildew
Ain't seen him since my first year of high school
I'ma pay his way out for 'bout a mill' or two
Ten years riding, I made sure he had some food
I held that shit down, now look what we can do

Crew full of winners, no way we can lose
I learned from mistakes, won't take another loss
Vibes in the Sprinter, headed to the mall
I rock flawless diamonds, please accept my flaws
I'm getting that money, money over all
If broke is your problem cash is gonna solve it
If she sell pussy better have some bond nigga
Hit you up high, you leaping like a frog (Frog)
Making these hits, I'm feeling like a batter
Bought myself a ladder, I'ma stack it tall (Tall)
Gunna don't pay attention to these blogs
They saying shit, I let this money talk (Oh, yeah)
Diamonds on me look like some glass shattered
My bitch's ass fatter, keep a nigga hard (Oh, yeah)
Cars got some custom seats, they can massage
Convertible coming at the end of March
