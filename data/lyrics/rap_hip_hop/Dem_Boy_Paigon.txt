Oh Man

Dem boy paigon
I can't stand them
I don't trust you if you ain't mandem
They wanna do me
I'ma do you
Before you do me
I'ma do you before you do me
You must have lost your mind
Small boy tek your time, mi said tek your time
You must have lost your mind
Small boy tek your time

All these niggas turn fake as the time goes by
All I need, all I need is my ride or die
Yo B, what's your name?
What's your number?
Face looking pretty
But I'm staring at your auhauhauh
And she don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from her
Zim zimmer
Who's got the keys to the bimmer?
Ride for my G's
And there ain't no team realer
J Hus enter the place
Big fat tool round my waist
Dem boy paigon
You can't bring them round me
Are you mad? You dey craze
Are you mad? You dey craze
Dem boy paigon
I can't stand them
I don't trust you if you ain't mandem
They wanna do me
I'ma do you
Before you do me
I'ma do you before you do me
You must have lost your mind
Small boy tek your time, mi said tek your time
You must have lost your mind
Small boy tek your time

Sexy girl called Chyna
Make me wanna wine and dine her
But one man can't satisfy her
She needs more wood for di fire
And if you don't wanna dance to the beat
Just bop your head to the beat
I invested in heat
So let a paigon try me (Wha?)
Now he's thinking why me?
J Hus enter the scene
Big fat tool in my jeans
Dem boy paigon
Don't bring 'em round me
Are you mad? Are you lean?
Are you mad? Are you lean?
Oh, they don't wanna grind
Go get a day job, go bill a line
I said, oh, they don't wanna grind
Go get a day job, go bill a line
I said, oh, they don't wanna grind
Go get a day job, go bill a line
I said, oh, they don't wanna grind
Go get a day job, go bill a line

Dem boy paigon
I can't stand them
I don't trust you if you ain't mandem
They wanna do me
I'ma do you
Before you do me
I'ma do you before you do me
You must have lost your mind
Small boy tek your time, mi said tek your time
You must have lost your mind
Small boy tek your time
