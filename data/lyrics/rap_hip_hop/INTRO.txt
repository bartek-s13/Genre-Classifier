I grew up in the age of Timberline and Pharrell shit
(Yeah, aye yo lets take them back man)
I grew up in the age of Timberline and Pharrell shit

Lets take them back, we back to the nineties
Then backed up on a track, so you'll have to remind me
I'm waiting just to show y'all there's a genius inside me
Call it what you want but I just call that shit timing
And oh my
Saying look at what he did
Went from dreaming with a vision to believing in the kid
Went from screaming in the stands
Now we're standing on stages
And I called it how I saw it, that's a standing ovation
Now let me say this
I took this to different places
I waited while they debated if the product wasn't basic
I hate to say this, but if we talking 'bout the basics
I was basically debating if Carter was gonna make it
Lucid thoughts, running through my head of broken dreams
They say i'm lost, shit, but everything ain't what it seems
My mind is tossed just because I wanted everything
But that won't stop when I go out there and live my dream
I'm talking late nights, take that shit to great heights
I'm talking stakes high, do this till i'm paid right
I'm never doubted, just flipping it for the profit
I dropped it, and then you copped it
So given this ain't a problem
The problem is that i'm honest
I'm honestly just a problem
I'm honestly speaking volume, so watch me turn up the volume
I just want it so bad, and you know i can't help it
Because I grew up in the age of Timberline and Pharrell shit
I do this for the kid, that never grew to be the astronaut
Sitting at his office desk, staring at his mackintosh
I do it for the music
I do it for the love
I do it because my reasons were way more than just because
I do it for the ones, who never had a chance
And when it's all said and done, I guess I do it for the fans
God damn
