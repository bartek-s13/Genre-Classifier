Ooh, AGODD on the track

Rockstar shit, skrrt off in my car
Little bitch, Off-White rock star
Look at me, yeah, I'ma go far
Can't stop me, tiger slides go hard
Didn't care, didn't ask how you are
Gave me head in the back of her car
Niggas mad ‘cause they see me going hard
Yeah, I'm a fucking rockstar

Popping a Xanny
We in the back of the Audi
Didn't care what you thought of me
Fendi with the klony
Do the drugs ‘cause I wanna die
Pretty girls, yeah, I make them cry
VIP, I don't wait in line
Come with me, I'ma get you high
No light fuck that pussy in the dark
Superrradical, yeah, you can call me Bart
Condo on the beach, yeah, with the GTR
Dressed like a goon,’ cause that's the life we are
Didn't give a shit, yeah, but now they hit me up
Fucked shawty once, yeah, and then she fell in love
Gucci on my belt, so you know she sees the Glock
Niggas always ask which designer I'ma rock
Rockstar shit, skrrt off in my car
Little bitch, Off-White rock star
Look at me, yeah, I'ma go far
Can't stop me, tiger slides go hard
Didn't care, didn't ask how you are
Gave me head in the back of her car
Niggas mad ‘cause they see me going hard
Yeah, I'm a fucking rockstar

Wish that I can take my life and respawn
Just to see what everybody on
You been in my head for too long
Playing all these games, I’m no pawn
All this Whitney made my dick go hard
I fucked her in a brand new car
Undercover with my brother all black
She hit my phone, she said she needed me back

Rockstar shit, skrrt off in my car
Little bitch, Off-White rock star
Look at me, yeah, I'ma go far
Can't stop me, tiger slides go hard
Didn't care, didn't ask how you are
Gave me head in the back of her car
Niggas mad ‘cause they see me going hard
Yeah, I'm a fucking rockstar
