I think you broke my heart again
Please don't leave me
Take my hand
I think you broke my heart again
Please don't leave me
Take my hand

Yo I watch you walk away cause
I didn't think you'd leave
I thought that you knew
That you meant everything to me
I know we get mad
And we yell and blow steam
But now you're gone
I only see you in my dreams
Don't know what to do
Cause lately I've been lacking passion
Self inflicted pain
Just to cause a damn reaction
Telling people not to cut
I'm lying to the masses
Cause I've been in my room
With the blade fucking laughing
Now I love the pain
It's evolved to an addiction
Only time my head is straight
Is off the prescriptions
But the voices in my head
Tell me keep resisting
So I shed the tears
And stare into the distance
Don't know what I'm looking for
But now I know it's hope
And I'm not gonna find that
From these pills or the dope
Burned in my emotions
With each breath of the smoke
I know that this time
I'll find a better way to cope

I think you broke my heart again
Please don't leave and
Take my hand

I gave you every part of me
Everything I had
You embrace the good
And you tone on the bad
Said that we'd be fine
And that you'd always have my back
But now you're gone I'm alone feeling like trash
I'm the love ship sinker
Dumb kid singer
Tough boy demeanor
I'm the stupid over thinker I
I've been tryna solve my problems
With the hit of a blunt I won't lie
I ain't been sober In months
I just smoke when I feel like
No one gives a fuck
Or when I'm in the dump Just wishing to give it up
That's every single day
These drugs are now apart of me
I'm a painter who's confused And lacking artistry

I think you broke my heart again
Please don't leave and
Take my hand
