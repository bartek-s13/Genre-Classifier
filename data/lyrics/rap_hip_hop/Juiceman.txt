Back up on the scene
I rep my team like what you mean?
They watch me like I am the screen
I'm the realist that you've ever seen
The Interview is here
And yes I'm talking bout the post
They mad cuz I'm getting bread
And I just burn it like some toast
They just want Juice to be gone
And disappear just like a ghost
But the Juice cannot do that, no, no, no, no, no
Came along this road
I made some friends, I made some foes
Met some fakes, and I met some hoes
Goin' have some more that's how it goes

I'm the juiceman, juiceman
People want the juiceman
I'm the one they try'n get cause I'm the one that's 
And they mad at me cuz I ball like I'm with the dukeman
People want the Juiceman, so they get the Juiceman
Juiceman, Juiceman, Juiceman
Juiceman, Juiceman, Juiceman
Juiceman, Juiceman, Juiceman
Juice

It's  the Juiceman that they want
It's the Juiceman they would shoot
If half these people had a gun
It's the juice they call the best
So everybody wanna hate
It's the Juiceman they want off the field
Cause they know that he great
It's the Juice they wanna rate
It's the Juice who's getting paid
It's the Juice who always keeps his cool like he sitting in the shade
It's the Juice who stay on a rage
It's the Juice they cannot take
It's the Juice who got so many bars I can't break out the cage
It's the Juice who making money, it's the Juice making millions
It's the Juice who made a track with Snoop
It's true you know I'm killin' it
It's the Juice that sign with Nike
It's the Juice that's on the mic
It's the Juice that they don't like, it's the juice that they don't like
Cuz I am the Juice, I am your type
It's the Juice who speak his mind
It's the Juice who's goin'a shine
And the Juice ain't hit his prime
It's the Juice

Yea
It's the Juice
Juice, Juice, Juice
This is the Post Interview
Hope you guys enjoy
