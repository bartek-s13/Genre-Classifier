Death and taxes that’s all we given
You can make a life but can’t make a livin'
You can make it work but that still ain't driven
Give a lot but that still ain't givin
Livin' life like this ain’t real though
Every night like this I feel so dead wrong
Collision is head on, my vision is dead and gone
