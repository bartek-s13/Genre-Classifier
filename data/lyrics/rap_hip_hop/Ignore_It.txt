Ayo, darling, let me chat to you
I got two, two things I wanna say to you
I wanna mad you up, then make it up to you
Yo, what happens next, girl, that's up to you
Ayo, but I don't do feelings
 I'm leaving, girl, you got me fiending up
Girl, you moving all dirty, but your momma loves saying you should do the cleaning up
Yeah, I'm trying to keep your attention
I'm a big boy like the Dimension
Big batty looking like perfection
She say she wanna give me satisfaction
Ayo, but I don't do feelings
 I'm leaving, girl, you got me fiending up
But I know a Lizzie's bae
I don't fuck with J's, I just wanna get paid them racks nigga

I got on my ones, these niggas my sons
I'm the only one, I'm the only one
Got God on my side, my niggas they ride
I'm the only one, I'm the only one for you

I never ask you for it
Girl, what I said, ignore it
Taking it slow now, why don't you slow down?
I never ask you for it
Girl, what I said, ignore it
Taking it slow now, why don't you slow down?

Said me and my bros be certi
I see you over there and you working
Working your body right, working your body right
They tell your time, how aversely
All this time, I be thinking you deserve it
So don't waste no time, come over here, put your body on mine
You looking nice in a tight dress, oh I think I might just
Girl, you're looking righteous, got me going crazy, it's a crisis
Slow down, slow down
Why don't you slow it down, you timeless

I got on my ones, these niggas my sons
I'm the only one, I'm the only one
Got God on my side, my niggas they ride
I'm the only one, I'm the only one for you
