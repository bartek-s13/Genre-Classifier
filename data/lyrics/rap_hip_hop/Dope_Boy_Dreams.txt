Pourin' up for them real niggas
We gon' roll one up for the real hittas
(I'm working on dying)
Quando Rondo, nigga

All the real niggas in Heaven, man, I need someone to call on
Nowadays these phones tapped, I don't even wanna talk on 'em
Down a very long road, these niggas ain't never walked on it
My back against the rope, she cut her ties so I could fall on it
You wasn't built to hold shit down, that's why you turned your back on me
You couldn't hold me down, even if you had on some gravity
I built my own empire, they tryna take down my masterpiece
I think they mad I turned my dreams into reality
See, I was grindin' out my trunk, I feel like Master P
Pourin' up for them real niggas
Roll one up for them real niggas
Dope boy dreams, sip out the cup for them real niggas
Post in the cut with them real killas

Loyalty run deep, but it seem like my friends ain't friends no more
Blood in the streets plus in my veins don't make us kin no more
15K, that's for a verse, remember gettin' 10 a show
Goin' before my time, I'm like a binder, I won't bend or fold
I put my dick inside your ear, fuck what you heard, but they stay talkin'
Feelin' just like Future off this herb, and plus them Perkys callin'
I could hear Miss Murdy callin'
Pick up the phone, she tellin' me I ain't got no worries, darlin'
Like Hakuna Matata
It ain't no more room on my roster
I flip around the city with top shottas
Timmy told me go get 'em, and I got 'em
All 'em broken promises, I never bought 'em

Abandoned  house all by myself
No, I don't really be on no party shit
I'm tryna feed the streets, I feel like Roddy Ricch
How you 'posed to be my dawg, you wanna murk me, though?
Signed to the streets three times, I feel like Durkio
Countin' a Patek while on a jet, I ain't talkin' Tokyo
You told them lies to me, no Pinocchio
And then you got the nerve to ask me how I feel, nigga
Pour one up for them real niggas
I wanna tell the world about you just so they could get jealous
And if you see her 'fore I do, tell her I wish that I met her
If I catch the opposition, guarantee I'ma stretch 'em
So he bet' not let me catch 'em
