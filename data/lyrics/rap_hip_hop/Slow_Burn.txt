Don't stop if you run away
No turning back, no other fate
You want to laugh, want to celebrate
You ruined that, faithfully
Move along I will hesitate
Fahrenheit, you're in centigrade
I did the math, I don't want to play
You wouldn't ask, truthfully
Let's get it out of the way
The long, slow burn
Don't wait for a rainy day
You're lucky now, but that'll change
I'm burning out, I don't want to fade
It couldn't last, truthfully
Move along I will hesitate
Fahrenheit, you're in centigrade
I did the math, I don't want to play
Remember that, remember that
Let's get it out of the way
