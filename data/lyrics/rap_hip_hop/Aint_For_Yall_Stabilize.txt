Intro:
Tired of instability gotta cope with my soul
Said i gotta cope with my soul
Said im tired of instability
Gotta cope with my soul
Verse 1:
Said that hating is admiration
Vice president envy the one who runnin' the nation
They plottin' patiently waiting
You imbeciles is mistaking
If you thinkin' Pace is fakin'
Or falling or stalling I'm only ballin'
I'm going all in
No time for hesitation
Just seizing all opportunities
Worship my immunity, this culture is no community
You'll never see the you in me, I'll prove it B
And ain't no bitch that scare me
I put pussy in obituaries, cemetery
Watch me hit this groove
Then I hit yo bitch, oh damn I'm smooth
Give her hammer damn I nailed a screw
And speaking of screws I lost a few
Talk is cheap what can you prove
The smartest kid was dumb in school
I'mma face my fears but you can run it's cool
That behooves you, I been a smooth dude
If a fool recovers from his fall, then I'm a fool for life
I'd face an adverse situation  twice
Ion run for shit, I use my speed in wit
I know y'all hungry but quit biting this
Hook:
I said I'm Tired of instability gotta cope with my soul
No matter what my mental say my heart seeking
These goals(2x)
And y'all should do it to y'all should focus son
Pace obeying none...Y'all obeying hoes?
I know y'all out y'all mind(2x)
This shit ain't for none of y'all
You should just let it go
(Here's my cue)
Verse 2:
Yeah the flow is lit, Pull up witcha bitch
Its levels to this shit, Pace just strokin' dick
Ain't no lickin clits, thats just for my main bitch
On some shit, niggas gettin hit
With a couple sticks, Slasher pack a couple bricks
Shout out Uncle Rick, and Caylo Finet
And the Black Hippy, shout out Crown Clique
I just hit a lick, yah
Y'all just on the same shit
Nigga quit, and i'm serious y'all delirious
Nod ya brain you feeling this
Papa say dont love them hoes
But papa steady lovin' hoes
Thats why Pace just find his own way
I dont follow nobody, yall throw hella stones
Niggas claim they fuckin yella bones
Lying on they bone, got me out my zone
But never really that, watch me get it back
Im on full attack get his back snapped
If he talkin yap, never really trapped
Still im feeling trapped, If life's a car
My seat belt never strapped
Plus im feeling like im selling crack
Way i spit this spiel, shit that they can feel
Talk yo shit it'll get yo killed
She love how i whip it my piece in her grill
Talkin is cheap im just keeping it real
Her tongue roun' this piece while im grippin the wheel
Never upset bruh i keep it on chill
I'm spittin that shit make em run for the hills(2x)
My talent is steel, they question my talent like
"Pace is it real?" I tell em wasup, i tell em the deal
"It's original, and im coming to kill." Foreal(3x)
(Hook)
Outro:
Brudda let it go(2x)
Yall should let it go
This shit ain't for yall(2x)
Bro im so appalled
Nigga stand up if you fall
If you fall, Aww nahh
I never fall, Stand tall
Awww naahhh(2x)
Just ball
