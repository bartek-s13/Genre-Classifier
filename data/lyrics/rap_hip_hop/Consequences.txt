(JULiA LEWiS)

Back when i was fifteen I go dumb where the bitches at
Had the Tall T with the Kings fitted cap
Spent the whole day lickin' hot chips off my fingers
And skip class to play with that kitty cat
Like 24/7 this shit is gospel you just listen to the reverend
You niggas online with that beef like Bob's Burgers
Where I come from they run fades like barbers
Yeah my daddy made me to a man so I watch what I say
He ain't around but I still got love for the man
He got locked up, bet he'd be mad at me for saying it
I'm mad as hell that ain't call me when I can pay that shit
Oo-kay i'm getting money nowadays; No
Time for the hoes; No, Time for the fakes
No words for the niggas trying to get up in my way
I made my own lane moving at my own pace
Oh-ooh, this shit is awesome
Used to work retail now they starstruck
Oh-ooh, pull me up a drink my G
Ain't a nigga around here that can stunt like me
Wait up

I think we got a whole city that we finna put on our backs, yeah
As far as y'all niggas I don't even see no one that's posing a threat
Cuz I just wanna chill, smoke, drink and be cool
I'm the worlds hottest rapper still tryna finish school
I got a few dreams I ain't really get to see yet
That's why I don't play
I don't take this shit for recess
I just wanna chill, smoke, drink and be cool
Have a couple bad women with me laying by the pool
I just want to chill, smoke, drink and be cool
Man these niggas average
And that's why I got the juice
Cuz I just want to chill, smoke, drink and be cool
Cuz I just want to chill, smoke, drink and be cool
Man, I just want to chill, smoke, drink and be cool
I just want to chill, smoke, drink and be cool

I just want to chill, smoke, drink and be cool
Have a couple bad women with me chillin' by the pool
If you come from where I come from, you know I'm used to never having shit
It's the hard knock life so I'm hungry as it gets
And it's hard not tripping when the song start niggas be like: "Yo that black kid is tight"
My nigga when the money start coming in and niggas start acting fake - that's when you know you living right
My nigga
Stack the money up cuz that's how you get the bitches
Where I come from money everybody vision
I can't blame em'
If you never had it
Tryna see a better life will probably turn you to a savage
My ex-girl mad I done glowed up
I'm at the top and her ass never showed up
I'm on the bus right as song is about to blow up
Telling they can kick back and that can get to know us
Wait up

I know we got a whole city that we finna throw on our backs Yeah
As far as y'all niggas I don't really see nobody posing a threat
I just want to chill, smoke, drink and be cool
Have a couple bad women laying by the pool
I just want to chill, smoke, drink and be cool
Man these niggas average
And that's why I got the juice
Cuz I just want to chill, smoke, drink and be cool
Cuz I just want to chill, smoke, drink and be cool
Man, I just want to chill, smoke, drink and be cool
I just want to chill, smoke, drink and be cool
Yep
