<<<<<<< HEAD
We barely played but now we starting to win
They tried to suppress us but fuck it we talking again
You tryna hang but wasn’t with me going hard in the gym
The critics like who spitting tougher than him, I got em jumping the fence
My shit bang but I ain’t gripping no metal
Bout to grab what’s really mine so I ain’t willing to settle
We just hit the green till we higher than Kilimanjaro
I’m just tryna rap ain’t tryna make no deal with the devil
What’s the status quo
I ain’t fucking with it gotta let em know
Up to em to argue who got iller bars and better flow
Shit’s a marathon I see the vision like a telescope
Built it from the ground, I ain’t waiting on a miracle
You try to violate you way out of line
Now we just focus on getting richer on day at a time
And for my brothers I won’t hesitate to pay outta mine
And real soon I’m bout to have these labels pray that I sign
And I’m just spitting facts you ought to listen, I’m on a mission
Chasing paper with a tunnel vision, it’s hard to miss it
A lot at stake everyday I’m juggling tough decisions
I do it for the ones who ain’t got em a pot to piss in
Stuck with this golden vision, while forming this coalition
We multiply no division, You rap but we know it’s fiction
I'm prolly the coldest rapper, who giving out cold emissions
With topics I’m known to visit, got clips like a loaded pistol
Now I’m just playing by the rules like it’s mandatory
And I don’t even bother texting I just let her call me
And when it’s litty I’m prolly getting the red Ferrari
Going viral for a while, that ain’t the pattern for me
Been in my lane, just don’t put me in that category
Plotting all night we been awake talking hella money
Settle for average I’m just never the type
This whole thing’s been one hell of a ride
