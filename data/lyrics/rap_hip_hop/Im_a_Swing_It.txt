<<<<<<< HEAD
On and just on, and 

I'm a swing it
Watch me bring it to the next level
The grafted devil's
Getting funky like The Neville
Brothers from the Bayou
So why you wanna trip?
Just play the sidelines, kid
And wait for me to slip
Cause I can feel it 'In the Air Tonight'
But yo I'm not Phil Collins
I'm more like Henry Rollins
Cause I "Search and Destroy"
Every toy with a plot
Trying to get what I got
You might get shot
Hot Damn! I'm a slam you like ONYX
Then teach you how to write a rhyme
Like Hooked on Phonics
Mother Goose ain't got shit on me
Cause I'll get loose at the jam
And wreck the whole party
I make 'em jump and mosh, oh my gosh
Just slamming in the pit
While I'm kicking my shit
They bugging in the aisles
Cause I got mad styles
And ain't a damn thing funny
I get money in piles
Some people thought I died
That's just a rumor though
Others thought I fell off
But now I'm Numero Uno
Dos, not Quatro
Word to Kool Keith
I'm a break up your teeth

When I die (die)
Bury me (me)
Hang my balls from a cherry tree (tree)
Let them get ripe (ripe) then take a bite (bite)
And if they don't taste right
Then don't blame D! (D)

You need to quit swinging
The style that I'm bringing
The funk-knuckled dragon
Who gets on the wagon
I'm not the twelve-stepper
Don't play me like a lever
"My Mic Sounds Nice"
But it's not Salt-N-Pepa

Well it's the man with the plan to get all your skins
The tip on my dick's where the line begins
So hoes form a line
Take off that swine
Strip your ass buck-naked
Let's see if you can take it
Cause I'll make you feel
"Like a Natural Woman"
Cause I keep it coming
I'm the EverlastingFreestyle Assassin
With Soul and my goal
Is to bring a little passion
To your girl's life like the daily soaps
Throw her down on the bed and tie her up with ropes

The Lyrics keep on and just on and
The Lyrics keep on and just on and
The Lyrics keep on and just on and
On and just on and on and just on and 

I'm just another Ranger with the Derry face
Punk motherfuckers beef about my race
You need step back, kid and give me some space
So I can cold-shock the party when I'm rocking the place
Danny Boy's arriving, I stand six five and a half
Don't laugh, kid
The outlaw biker with my bitch hitchhiker
On the 'Highway to Hell'
Cause I never tell

Well it's the funk backbreaker
We "Heat it Up"  like Jamaica
Don't bring your woman to the party
Cause I'll take her
Hit the deck, cause I'm down with the hooleys
I got a trunk full of funk just like the Groovie Goolies
I'm not the man but I asked you "Who was he?"
Quik's got the hairdo just like Ruth Buzzi
Running 'round town like you been to jail, son
But you hit the swap meet
To get your hair and your nails done
Get off my sack cause your shit is wack
