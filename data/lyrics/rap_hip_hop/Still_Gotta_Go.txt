Verse 1:
Once upon a time a long time ago I wrote a song about a lot of ho’s
All the wrong ones, the lost ones, the tall tales twice sold
The difference between them and women, I see it as something like growth
They’ll slide in my dm pretending they’re seeking asylum, and I know
Until I met you, and real as it gets I did not expect you
Intelligence and a high I.Q., perfect smile and a booty too
But you made it clear no sudden moves
Six months you shut me down I just stuck around and tried to follow rules
Become your friend till I pursued
And that first day that we kicked it was the best day that I’ve had
We walked around the whole damn town, you held my hand and we laughed
Even asked your permission to give you a kiss and you grabbed my face and kissed back
This story is corny but true, and I knew right then what we had
Fast forward just a little bit and now its getting real and oh yeah
We eat and we live and we sleep and we dream and we build together, we plan
Until late one night, you looked at me and said, “Sam…
I don’t know why but I’ve still gotta go and it’s just the way that I am,” Damn…
Chorus:
Bridge:
I need rosaries like groceries, I need my soul to feed so I pray
Just go to sleep and then wake up and hope everything is ok
Gotta give it time cause it heals all wounds it appears or so they say
Yeah, it appears or so they say…
Verse 2:
She’s still gotta go oh why this, she’s still gotta go so righteous
But one of a few that I vibe with, neither one of us even likes kids
I thought we could build a life with a two person tribe on some type shit
Now I will admit that I might have bit a little more than I can chew through this crisis, oh
If I’m talking free well then let’s be real, yeah honestly I sense the guilt
Like a prophecy that went too fulfilled, like I called the shot and you shot to kill
You gave it all to me but then it made you feel like there’s something to prove
When I want you to be what you want you to be and give love to you still, but
I’m humbled to say that I’ve learned this again, yeah
Like nothing we say is for certain but damn
What I could not say that night, in the midst of that pain and that hurt where I stand
You’ve made  me a way better person and man, so all of that pain was worth it and then
If I leave you better than when I’ve found you then I’ve done my job and it’s true
You have done your job and it’s cool, yeah we have done a lot to improve
And while I don’t believe that there’s only one, I do believe that there’s few
And by my count now I’ve found and lost, yeah I’ve found and lost at least you…damn…
