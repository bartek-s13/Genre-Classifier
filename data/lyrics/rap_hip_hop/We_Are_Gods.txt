Yeah. where do I start?
Bryan Divisions musician with visions all sent from the heart
Insisting we got
Energy built up and stocked
Inside of the well that resides where it's dark
Where we can't see, and all time is stopped
Captured are we no concept of the clocks
All aspects of God, I'm seeing the cause
And effect of the source of what we call the laws
And then we go down
Into the subconscious where thoughts become sound
A feeling that I've wanted to come around
Cause I know Im not bound
To this body on earth so I don't need a crown
Unless it's my chakra connecting me, sending me
New cosmic energy, letting me
D own to my root where safe thoughts are protecting me
Nothing is getting me, no evil entities, they're not akin to me
I ain't got time for the demons
I'm focused on being here now, and see it go down
They think that I've fallen cause I don't believe in
The dogmas they found, but my mind won't be bound
Different avatars for different cultures and times
These vultures think that I'm committing these crimes
I opened up my mind, I've discovered myself as a soul beyond time
It's who we really are, who we really are
We are gods, we are one, we are made of stars
It's who we really are, who we really are
We are gods, we are one, we are made of stars

And don't you ever forget it, and don't you ever forget
And don't you ever forget that you can mold this gold from lead

We're on this planet to grow, together and unified
Don't remain stoned by beliefs that have petrified
Billions of souls throughout all of these human times
Keeping us severed from love and new ways of life
When will we see that all life is so sacred
I'm tired of waiting I wish we would make it
Instead they just blindly will follow and fake it
Don't accept what's different so then they all hate it
But we're here to find connection
And we're here to breathe this nature
We're here to start ascending
Speed up the frequency like vapor
Here to speak our feelings
We're here to spread more love
We're here to keep on healing
We're here to be whats now, not once was
We're here to be whats now, not once was
We're here to be whats now, not once was
And don't you ever forget it, and don't you ever forget
And don't you ever forget that you can mold this gold from lead
