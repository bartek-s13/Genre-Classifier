I tell my mama that I love her, I'm still chasing this dream
But I made a bigger promise than I know I can keep
I haven't talked to shawty in weeks
Yeah, all that I've been hoping is you come to my shows, so when I look into the crowd, I see a little bit of home (Woah, mm, mm, mm)
My dad, he tells me fight and go and get it on my own
While mama askin why I wanna leave her home alone, come on! (Come on)
She wanna see the money, wanna see me succeed, mom, I made a million dollars then awoke from my dream
Oh, it's so oh-oh-oh
It's so, it's so oh-oh-oh

I'm just tryna be who I pictured I'd be at the age of 18, couple months to 19
Now I'm thinking that these vices could be making me weak, haven't spoke about it in weeks (I just smoked some-)
And got everybody telling me that I'm gonna blow
So it's hard to say just how I ended up on the floor
And I heard she don't wanna come to my shows
And shawty that's alright and that's just fine with me
'Cause I made a million dollars then awoke from my sleep, oh!
Think I'm close to selling my soul
Then I'll have everybody at my shows, jumpin' up and on their toes, screaming something, talkin' 'bout some rock and roll (Rock and roll)
It's all just rock and roll, yeah

Then I'll have everybody at my shows, jumpin' up and on their toes, screaming something, talkin' 'bout some rock and roll (Rock and roll)
It's all just rock and roll, yeah
Yeah, I'll have everybody at my shows, jumpin' up and on their fucking toes, screaming something, talkin' 'bout some rock and roll (Rock and roll)
It's all just rock and roll, yeah
