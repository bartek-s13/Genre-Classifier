<<<<<<< HEAD
Ain't no discussion
Only a year I been rappin', they say I'm a problem or somethin'
They know that I want it
I'm tryna get to the top with a Maserati like it's nothin'
They know how I'm comin'
I need them hundreds in hand
Music droppin' for my fans
You won't understand
I'm tryna make me the man
Fifty bands on my mans when I'm in the...
Fuck it, it's no discussion that we came up from nothing
Don't wanna hear the shit that niggas talking, I'll probably be focused on me getting hundreds
I don't need a budget, I been the man
I been the man since niggas was the youngin
I got my jewelry out, it ain't tuckin'
I know that these niggas cappin', they be bluffin'
I aim with the tool

I came from nothing, no discussion, now I'm something, yeah
I came from nothing, no discussion, now I'm something, yeah
I came from nothing, no discussion, now I'm something, yeah
I came from nothing, no discussion, now I'm something, yeah

No discussion, I'm bossin'
Straight to the top like a Martian
I'm never gon' say what it wasn't
No games as a kid
I was locked up, doin' bids
Kept robbin' niggas for they shit
You snitch, you a bitch
Luckily I found my gift
It's risky out here tryna flip
I roll up a spliff
Diamonds dancing on my wrist
I dreamt about it, now it's lit
I'm finally here, can't wait 'til I'm finally there
The competition see me now
They see me and stare
"like how the fuck it been a year?
He jeopardizing my career"
I don't give a fuck
Just ask me, I'll tell you what's up
I leveled up good enough
And the top is a must
This bitch want me all in her guts
But I ain't got time for no smut

I came from nothing, no discussion, now I'm something, yeah
I came from nothing, no discussion, now I'm something, yeah
I came from nothing, no discussion, now I'm something, yeah
I came from nothing, no discussion, now I'm something, yeah

Look at the chances we taking
Watching my steps while I'm dancing with Satan
Life isn't given when I can be acing
Hand on my handle, just pacing
I let niggas spin through the nation
Now she got plans on relation
I got this pimp shit in my blood
I just want me some vacation
I gotta mix up all my drugs
Girl, can you hand me one? Take it
I got some niggas that's dead in the bar
But still hard to handle and take it
It's still hard to handle and take it
But I gotta manage the way that I move
When I make sure my family's straight
I deserve me a standing ovation (Yeah yeah)
'Cause of the gunplay, I got dead friends
On the one way to a dead end
I was led in to these cold streets
By some wild niggas that was bled in
When I'm in the Ghost I can see the ghosts
And the red end
Niggas came close, tryna knock me off
I was hanging on the ledge edge
Niggas say the most 'til they close
And they don't be claiming what they said then
Don't wanna end up in the fed pen
Gotta slow down, think ahead then
Gotta slow down, think ahead then, yeah, uh
I see the jealousy clear
I can smell hell in the air, I swear the devil is near

I came from nothing, no discussion, now I'm something, yeah
I came from nothing, no discussion, now I'm something, yeah
I came from nothing, no discussion, now I'm something, yeah
