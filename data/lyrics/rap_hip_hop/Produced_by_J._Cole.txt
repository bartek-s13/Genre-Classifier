<<<<<<< HEAD
This is just my check in on a mission tryna find myself
Vexed missing blessings
Tryna find my Wealth
The best
Always dressed
In nothing less than
What's comfortable
Excuse my diction
I been bumping Nas
For a month or two
Watching all the things in this world
That's supposed to be a part of me
Got me ready to make my own Carter Three
See this shit is a part of me
So pardon me
I had to part
My opposition
Had to get my own pot to piss in
Had to make my own bread
Build my own business
I had to make it past chilling in the hood business
Seeing my dad really put me in a different state
Fuck what I been running for
I'm lost in another race
The one for my soul
The one against my demons
The one I drink away
The one that keeps me scheming
Late at night to be a star
You know I call it dreaming
It's not about the fame I mean that
I really mean it
But let me tell you the truth
And why I do this here's the reason
I promise you it's not no corny shit
I'm really speaking
I wanna save lives first and foremost
Cuz I remember Chance The Rapper saving me from jumping outta dorm rooms
But I also need money
Cuz my family ain't got it
And see I got a talent
That could fill up mom's wallet
So for me to not get paid
Is literally me wilding
You gotta understand
My life won't be like yours without it
And I cannot just chill
And wait to perish at the bottom
So you gon have to hear me
Make my way thru all my problems
Cuz Nigga I am legend
Fresh Prince but I ain't rich
I'm a dog
Kinda small
But ain't never been bitch
Problem 1
Nigga, I was broke last year
I couldn't afford shit
Almost sold dope last year
Just weed
You know in case I make it with this dream
This next one in line
Behind balling in the league
See I cannot fail
Because my pockets so frail
Worst part of my day
Was putting up with Auntie yells
Then Nic called
You know that's my big dawg
He said we gotta hit New York
You a big fish don't get small
So he took some dollars
He coulda gave to his daughter
And put em on a nigga that he knew would take this farther
I was scared as fuck
I even fainted on the plane
Cuz I knew this was it
I'd never see the bay the same
We
Got up in them offices
Gave em a good listen
Told em' I could see the future of the game
I got a vision
I can change the whole thang
Like when Jordan met Pippen
I know you see the same
Nodding yo head while you listen
I know that I got a thing for being the best out
Respected like D-Rose
Savvy like Steve Stoute
Dipping on these hoes
Blowing my weed out
Fixing my Yankee cap
Rewriting my daily raps
I swear I'm the cleanest out
Cole I need a beat
Like you need a damn haircut
Cole I need a beat
Got some bars
You wouldn't dare touch
See at least you fucking with me now
I was scared first
I didn't wanna let you down
Peace to who wears the crown
Look around
Now I swear It's different in the world for guys like us
Not just emcees
Niggas who really say real stuff
Including Lil Uzi, 21, Kodak, Tee Grizz, Lil Yachty, Denzel Curry, Migos, Rae Sremm, Rich Homie, and of course my nigga Thug
All my dawgs painting what our childhoods was
You get no love
If you hating
On a young man
Stacking up his chips
Like he finna go all in
The system want us missing
I can see they hate the vision
I'm done tryna play the game for niggas that's just sitting
I'm done tryna be the guy
That's getting all the bitches
I just wanna touch the sky
And bring you all there to witness
I just wanna touch the sky
And bring you all there to witness

So let me spread my wings
Aye let me spread my wings
So let me spread my wings
Aye let me spread my wings
So let me spread my wings
