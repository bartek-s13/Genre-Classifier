When I think of love I see your face
But when I think of you I think of pain
My heart and mind are not on the same page
It's obvious I get carried away
All of the things that I don't know
All of the feelings I don't show
My mind doesn't know where to go tho
Got me standing in place like a photo
But I know you don't know
I should know by now
That every time that I make up my mind
And you know it's too late, 'cause I ran outta time
And you know it

Now it's 3AM and I'm on the phone
Checking on your page while I'm all alone
You'd think I'd learn or I'd try to change
Why does this always end the same?

I'm tired of falling out of love
I'm tired of the rise and fall
I'll leave before it starts
'Cause I don't wanna get my hopes up
I'm tired of falling out of love
I'm tired of the rise and fall
I'll leave before it starts
'Cause I don't wanna get my hopes up
I play it all inside my head so I remember
I think about the way we were back in November
Every moment that I waste on holding out for one more chance
Isn't worth the pain I hold so close to me
Wish I could forget it all

Now it's 3AM and I'm on the phone
Checking on your page while I'm all alone
You'd think I'd learn or I'd try to change
Why does this always end the same?

I'm tired of falling out of love
I'm tired of the rise and fall
I'll leave before it starts
'Cause I don't wanna get my hopes up
I'm tired of falling out of love
I'm tired of the rise and fall
I'll leave before it starts
'Cause I don't wanna get my hopes up

I'd rather sleep alone than play this game again
I'd rather play it safe than feel the pain again
And I just know by now how this will end up
Maybe it's you or maybe I'm the one who's fucked up
I'd rather sleep alone than play this game again
I'd rather play it safe than feel the pain again
And I just know by now how this will end up
Maybe it's you or maybe I'm the one who's fucked up
I'm tired of falling out of love
I'm tired of the rise and fall
I'll leave before it starts
'Cause I don't wanna get my hopes up
I'm tired of falling out of love
I'm tired of the rise and fall
I'll leave before it starts
'Cause I don't wanna get my hopes up
