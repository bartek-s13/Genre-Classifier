Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah
I came from nothing, man, yeah
Yeah, for real, whole lot of Soldier shit going on, man
Damn VG, you made this?

They told me I wouldn't be rapping, but look at what happened, I did it for real (For real, for real)
In Brooklyn, I'm chillin' with Johnny, he know I fuck with him, we made us a deal (For real)
He know that I'm fire with this rappin' but I'm in the hood and he know I'm for real (For real)
So you can sit down with that cappin' 'cause you can get popped like a motherfuckin' pill, yeah
I'm in the A with my shooter, I keep him around 'cause I know he gon' step, yeah
Soldier Life all on my body, if you in my circle then you in the set, yeah
Every loss that I took was a lesson, I needed a blessin', I picked up the Bible
I need to get right with myself but I'm all in the hood and we clutchin' them rifles

Securing the bag, I'm not asking for shit, yeah
I had to get up and go get it
Was down on my last and I couldn't see the path
Damn, I felt like a motherfuckin' midget
Securing the bag, I'm not asking for shit, yeah
I had to get up and go get it
Was down on my last and I couldn't see the path
Damn, I felt like a motherfuckin' midget
Play my bitch to the side, I ain't trippin' on that, 'cause this shit ain't forever (This shit ain't forever)
Put her in position, this shit ain't for live, and until then whatever (Until it's whatever, yeah)
Let me tell you 'bout Soldier, I'm keepin' it gangster, you can't come around, I ain't lookin' for love
And I need a bitch that's gone ride for the dick and then step on the line like we stepped on the rug
Fuckin' this bitch, she was sellin' me drinks and she had my attention (She had my attention)
She was tellin' me this and was tellin' me that and I told her to listen (I told her to listen)
If I'm caught with the work and get sent to the county, bitch, is you gon' write me or leave me to suffer?
Cut off your niggas while holding me down 'cause these bitches so slick, they'll fuck with your brother
I just hopped on a plane, finna go to New York, man, I'm all through the country (I'm all through the country)
I was just in the trap, I was stuck in the rain, now I'm out in the sunny (I'm out in the sunny, for real)
They just wanna ride the wave (What?), but they know I'm official (They know I'm official)
They better stay out of my face (My face), 'cause we strapped with them missiles (We strapped with them missiles)
I just pulled up in LA, this edition, I'm fuckin' that ho and that pussy exclusive
I see why he mad and I see why he trippin'
When I come around then he start actin' stupid
Went after a sack 'cause I didn't have a choice
Now I'm steppin' in foreigns, chasin' after money
Steppin' in Gucci, my chain is so stupid
Don't fuck with the snakes, I'ma keep it a hundred
I got some niggas that really went fed, and I'm makin' 'em proud, but it's leavin' a mark
'Cause when they get out I'ma be on the top but they 'posed to be with me right here at the start
And I'm still facing cases, I hope they work out, I got court in the morning (I got court in the morning)
And I'm still with this shit, you ain't taking a thing, I'ma need me a lawyer, yeah, yeah

Securing the bag, I'm not asking for shit, yeah
I had to get up and go get it
Was down on my last and I couldn't see the path
