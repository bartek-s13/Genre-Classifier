(Drum Dummie)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh
(Reuel Stop Playing)
Quando Rondo, nigga, yeah, yeah
I don't know what I need
So when I tell you that I love you
Girl, I really don't mean it
Yeah, I really don't mean it
Yeah

You really touched me to my heart
Permanent scar that day I found that you cheated
I kept it real with you girl, I guess you was tryna get even
I feel like Adam, you're my Eve, we in the Garden of Eden
How the fuck you claim you love someone when you don’t know the real meanin'?
You always listen to your friends and let 'em come in between us
I guess that ring and that new teddy bear, lil' shawty, don't mean nothin'
Don't understand where we stand, I might need a chair
The way that I been feelin' lately, you ain't never care

I call your phone and you don't pick up, baby girl, you got me nervous
Is it the cameras or the fame, the Tory Burch or all them purses?
I know your worth and girl you worthless
Anything you wanted, I purchased
Baby, I know you ain't perfect, what I do to deserve this?
I know I lied, I don't spend time, I know I cheated before
You asked me why, did not reply, I never needed no ho
Look at the sky, I'm 'bout to dive, I'm 'bout to jump off the boat
I hope I drown, I hope I die, my heart gon' float coast to coast
I'm with some youngins from the trenches who gon' serve by the store
I won't admit it, I'm addicted, sippin' lean, pourin' fours
Spin on they block, it ain't no missin', leave some shells on the floor
I wrote her name inside that prison in the cell on the door
My nigga tellin' me I'm trippin' 'cause I fell for that ho
She sent me pictures on call, girlfriend threw her mail on the floor
I put some VVs in my teeths, they cost a band of some coke
I'ma send some BBs to your opps, and yeah, we want all the smoke

You really touched me to my heart
Permanent scar that day I found that you cheated
I kept it real with you girl, I guess you was tryna get even
I feel like Adam, you're my Eve, we in the Garden of Eden
How the fuck you claim you love someone when you don’t know the real meanin'?
You always listen to your friends and let 'em come in between us
I guess that ring and that new teddy bear, lil' shawty, don't mean nothin'
Don't understand where we stand, I might need a chair
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
The way that I been feelin' lately, you ain't never care (QRN)

I made a oath to all my niggas, I ain't gon' never change on 'em
I threw the ones to all the strippers, I want Ben Franks on 'em
I told 'em keep they handshakes 'cause they love fakin', it's phony
I remember way before the cameras and the fame, they ain't want me
Two car garage in the streets
Girl, I go hard in these streets
I left my heart in these streets
Girl, I'm the hardest in the streets
We shoot at cars in the streets
We slang that rod in the streets
Too many broads in the seat
Play your cards fuckin' with me
She want Chanel on her feet
Hair and nails, they on fleek
She keep them Ms by the week
Cartier lens so she can see
She keeps my pints, I sip that lean
I tote that Glock with that big red beam
I'm in love with that block, Blocboy JB
Nigga run up, get shot, we don't aim for feet
Sellin' rocks just to eat with the big OGs
Yeah, my pain runnin' deep like the deep, blue sea
Why they hatin' on a G? They don't even know me
Double cup filled syrup, baby lean on me
When I post in the hood, got a Glock on the seat
So I wish a nigga would, got a Glock in my reach
Backwood full of kush, no Swisher Sweets
Steady lyin' through yo' teeth, so I know you cheat
My heart so cold 'til the day we meet
Every time that I'm able, you know I preach
I ain't never watched cable, I was out in the streets
Sittin' in the cell, readin' Psalms 23
Phone call from the label, my song got leaked
Whatever you sow, best believe you gon' reap
Every time it's, smoke you know we creep
Up with the pole every time it's beef, yeah
I really came from the trenches, I had to grind and hustle
Every day I stayed on the mission to make it out the struggle
I'm kickin' shit in new Givenchy, drippin' all these puddles
I'm with my team, we got a plan, no we ain't gotta huddle

You know how far the way we came if you had been where we was
I'm in the court room, locked in chains, I'm gettin' judged by a judge
So I really don't mean it, yeah, I really don't mean it, woah
Quando Rondo, nigga
