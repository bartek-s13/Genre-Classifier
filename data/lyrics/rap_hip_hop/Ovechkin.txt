Ovechkin
Facts, uh

God got me, ain't no question
Ice up on my wrist, it's all a blessin'
Skatin' like Ovechkin
All them on my wrist ain't no protection
Shawty want too much attention
I don't want you, girl, I want your best friend
She don't come with questions
Brought her to my suite up on the west end

Late night, I'm on the west end
On the road collectin' my collections
We gon' take off like The Jetsons
On this chick, she ride me like an equestrian
And she don't come with questions
Shawty wanna catch all of my blessings
I don't 'fess, no I finesse it
Hundred fifty I made it straight off electrics
Stack and I invest it
I want lots of money, lots of leverage
Man, these streets done made me restless
Even got it on my when I'm restin'
I just got me more extensions
Just in case they get the wrong intention
I done got me a selection
All these pretty women in my section
God got me, ain't no question
Ice up on my wrist, it's all a blessin'
Skatin' like Ovechkin
All them on my wrist ain't no protection
Shawty want too much attention
I don't want you, girl, I want your best friend
She don't come with questions
Brought her to my suite up on the west end

Had to cut a bitch off 'cause she ain't motivated
My life amazin', I fucked a bitch, she A-list
Out in Vegas, she wanna make me famous
We on a spaceship, we on our way, sedated
I made her crave it, that's ever since she tasted it
I think she crazy, she wanna have my baby
Skirtin' off in my German car

God got me, ain't no question
Ice up on my wrist, it's all a blessin'
Skatin' like Ovechkin
All them on my wrist ain't no protection
Shawty want too much attention
I don't want you, girl, I want your best friend
She don't come with questions
Brought her to my suite up on the west end
