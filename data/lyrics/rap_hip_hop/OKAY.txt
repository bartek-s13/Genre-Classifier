I act like I'm okay
I'm not okay, I'm not okay
I used to want you here now stay away (Now stay away)
I act like I'm okay
I'm not okay, I'm not okay (I'm not okay)
I used to want you here now stay away (Now stay away)

I've seen better days, wish I could go back
I just wanna end it all, but I hold back
They just wanna see me fall, and I know that
When the sun shines, rain falls, rain falls
I think that she can read my mind
I cannot go to sleep at night
It gets hard for me to breathe
And I can't close my eyes, can't close my eyes

I tell the truth, you feed me lies
I'll die for you, you'll watch me die
For you (I'll die for you)
For you (I'll die for you)

I act like I'm okay
I'm not okay, I'm not okay
I used to want you here now stay away (Now stay away)
I act like I'm okay
I'm not okay, I'm not okay (I'm not okay)
I used to want you here now stay away (Now stay away)
