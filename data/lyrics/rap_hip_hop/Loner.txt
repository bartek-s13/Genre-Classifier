I don't want to be your cigarette
I don't want to be your ashtray
I don't want to be your doormat
Don't want to be ignored
All o' sudden you're not into me
And maybe it's not deliberate
And I know you never asked me
I just gotta put it out there
I don't put myself out there
Usually, I stay tucked away

'Cause I was a loner until I met you
And I let you in after all the persuasion
Mind games, manipulations

That's why I'd rather be a loner (loner)
Yeah, I'd rather be alone (alone)
I don't even want to know ya (know ya)
I don't want to be known (to be known)
'Cause I'd rather be a loner (loner)
I'd much rather be alone (alone)
Baby, it was nice to know ya (know ya)
Packing up and leaving home
No, I don't want to be your cigarette
Use me up then toss me, step on me
I don't want to be an option
Avoidin' interaction, 'cause
I just want to get away
And maybe you got a full plate
Know I'm cookin' something better
But if you don't want me now
No, boy, I don't want you later
Don't try to come and eat with me

'Cause I was a loner until I met you
And I let you in after all the persuasion
Headaches and allegations

That's why I'd rather be a loner (loner)
Yeah, I'd rather be alone (alone)
I don't even want to know ya (know ya)
I don't want to be known (to be known)
'Cause I'd rather be a loner (loner)
I'd much rather be alone (alone)
Baby, it was nice to know ya (know ya)
