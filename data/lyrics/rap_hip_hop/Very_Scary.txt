Five band coat come from Burberry
Diamonds dancing, wet canary
Fossils on me, Arc'teryx
Wipe my nose like January
Say my name like Bloody Mary
No, I'm not no ordinary
VS diamonds, very scary
VS diamonds, very scary

Me and 16, double trouble
Daxz my double, moving funny
Bought a chain and bought another
This shit come like bread and butter
Underdog and undercover (under undercover)
VS, yeah, on my wrist, yeah
My chain on lightning, wrist on thunder (yah yah yah)
If I speak it, I won't stutter (yah yah yah)
You won't find me in no other (nah nah nah)
Pour the drop, it help me slumber (what)
Money coming very scary, very scary
Money coming very scary, very scary
Diamonds shining very scary (very scary)
I don't got no adversaries (adversaries)
That's your dark imaginary (you you you)
Diamonds dancing, wet canaries
White boy with me, shoot like Larry
Put my life on the line, double dare me
Five band coat come from Burberry
Diamonds dancing, wet canary
Fossils on me, Arc'teryx
Wipe my nose like January
Say my name like Bloody Mary
No, I'm not no ordinary
