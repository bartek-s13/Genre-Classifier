You hate it when I'm gone
And I hate to leave you lonely
You feeling unimportant
I'm sorry if you're bored
And you hate it when I'm gone (When I'm gone)
And I hate to leave you lonely
You feeling unimportant (You feeling unimportant)
I'm sorry if you're bored with me (And I'm sorry)
Through all this, all this, all this pain (All this pain)
I promise I won't turn away (Turn away)
Through all this, all this, all this pain (All this pain)
I hope that you would feel the same

I wanted to stay, but I gotta leave
Please don't be afraid, you're all that I think
Oh no, baby, what you need?
Oh no, baby, what you need? (Fuck)
All this stress on me lately (Stress on me lately)
Tears make me crazy (Tears make me crazy)
I'm goin' through this daily (I'm goin' through this daily)
Know you might hate me
I'm in it, I hope that you get it
But, baby, know when I start winning
Gon' be harder than what you can deal with
The money is stacked to the ceiling
Still not enough to keep you with me
Guess now I know nothing could save me

You hate it when I'm gone
And I hate to leave you lonely (Fuck)
You feeling unimportant (No)
I'm sorry if you're bored (Yeah, yeah)
And you hate it when I'm gone (When I'm gone)
And I hate to leave you lonely (Lonely)
You feeling unimportant (Feeling unimportant)
I'm sorry if you're bored with me (And I'm sorry)
Through all this, all this, all this pain (All this pain)
I promise I won't turn away (Turn away)
Through all this, all this, all this pain (All this pain)
