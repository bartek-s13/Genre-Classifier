<<<<<<< HEAD
And we on today, and we on today
And we on today, You know it rains down, i'm gone away
Gotta hurry up now, that's ándale, that's ándale
And we on today, you know it rains down, i'm gone away
Gotta hurry up now, that's ándale, when the clock slows down, that's ándale

Came back to life
Came to raise the bar, so I grabbed the mic
You just want to move on when the timing's right, but if you living for tomorrow then you'll miss tonight
I got the time in my bag, i'm a prospect
Living out a vision and we isn't even on yet
Not a proper sentence, but i'm sensing that you're complex
But now i'm truly sentenced to a future that'll be complex
Go and ('fess 'fess 'fess 'fess) my sins away
Play the beat backwards and drift away
Walking on matches, not today
Setting fire to the ashes, feel the pain
And I can't complain
Set sail and we coast, yeah, still deranged
Cause' I can only hope and turn the page
The book ain't even wrote, yeah it must remain
Only thoughts will provoke him
Goes in when hes soaking, holy water for the bath go and hold your nose then
Only hold him back, pop the tab, now he's floating
Dreams are living sad in his head, never spoken
And I came to get a strap, like a backpack, hashtag
Mix-tape finished, where the strap at?
Mixing in the fact, that my tape had the last laugh
Pressing up one thousand, throwing that in a knapsack
Took a nap, then its time to rap back
Tired of the ones who don't snap, I still rap
Tired of the lovers thrown back, but still whack
I've heard it all enough, made a track, go kill snap
Back to reality, cope with this salary
Nope, they don't doubt on me, hope they look down on me
Woah, that's a tragedy, climbing up to the valley's peak
One step away, you looking down, and that's a casualty

And we on today
You know it rains down
I'm gone away
Gotta hurry up now that's ándale
When the clock slows down that's on delay
And we on today
You know it rains down, i'm gone away
Gotta hurry up now that's ándale
When the clock slows down that's on delay. (And okay)

Looking back now, and its okay
Never back down, that's what they're gonna say
Come on rap now, with it all day
But the time flies by when you don't think
Got it locked down, through the hallway
Got it locked down, we on our way
To the top now, what you gon' say?
When the drop so close but the goal ain't
In the mindset, started out, music over everything
Man, you wouldn't leave my head
Infatuated thoughts, got me thinking about a life
Wanting everything, even shit that wasn't said
Cause when the rain come down, and the lights don't shine
Imma still want you, you can take your time
When I take that road, when I walk that line
When i'm searching for a back, you can take mine, mine
Go and take it back, heard enough of that
Went to get it back, wouldn't last
Where the love was at?
Tried to double-back, fumble that
Shit was so sad, was it love at last?
Di-di-didn't think of that, woah
Took a back road,  a time a go
When I spent it all alone with the rhythm and the flow
But my mind wasn't gold, and the time was your soul
Couldn't find nothing more, i'm confined till i'm old
That's old soul, that's old school
You the new age, that's not cool
Turn a new page, make new rules
Fuck the old ways, just do you
Living life till the days turn dark
Trapped between the walls of today and tomorrow
Wish tomorrow was today, but tomorrow never came
I guess i'm really all alone, time to turn the other page
Flip it back where it all began, just a kid, thirteen, with a pen in his hand
He put the words on the page, yeah he wrote for days
But the days turned to hours when it all became
Turned the cold to rain, turned the coal to flames
Turned the dream to fame, yeah its all the same
If anybody wanna get it, we gon' give it like that
Because you know it rains down when we giving you the track

And we on today
You know it rains down, i'm gone away
Gotta hurry up now that's ándale
When the clock slows down that's on delay
And we on today
You know it rains down, i'm gone away
Gotta hurry up now that's ándale
When the clock slows down that's on delay
=======
And we on today, and we on today
And we on today, You know it rains down, i'm gone away
Gotta hurry up now, that's ándale, that's ándale
And we on today, you know it rains down, i'm gone away
Gotta hurry up now, that's ándale, when the clock slows down, that's ándale
