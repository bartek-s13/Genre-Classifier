Hm-hm-hm, hm-hm, hm-hm... heh
Yeah
Yo

Dang it feels like 2nd Grade
Out here passing notes
Have the bros all laughing, jokes in passing at my passion for
Your face, your soul - YO, shush!
Or she might pick up on the fact I've got a massive crush
Rush and I blush as I try to say 'hi'
Stutter and mutter and mush on my mind
What a commotion behind me! Really you guys?
Well, I guess the jig is up, what a shame
And since I'm already here I may as well just say:

I'm sorry to bother you
But I'm so in love with you
Hey
I know this is something I do
But that don't mean that it's not true
I'm in love with you

If I could fall in love with every single girl in the world
I think I might
See I like the feeling of just not knowin'
The all-or-nothing, the wondering, the 'hand-touch-moment'
The eye-lock, that second that you go in-
Hoping they do the same;
Everything you're saying
And the way you look at me...
Girl it drives me crazy!
And that's a matter of fact, don't think it's not, girl
I can fall in love even if I fall in love a lot, yo!

I'm sorry to bother you
But I'm so in love with you
Hey
I know this is something I do
But that don't mean that it's not true
I'm in love with you

And you might think I'm slick
Or it's all a big trick
Or that I'm playing you
But my heart's playing me
And I mean what I say
It is what it is
And girl I've got a crush
So right now let's be kids I-

I'm sorry to bother you (Woah, I)
But I'm so in love with you (In love, no no no, ho-oh)
Hey
I know this is something I do (I know, I know!)
But that don't mean that it's not true (That don't, that don't)
I'm in love with you
