No, no one will ever hold me down
Litty with the gang and with my hometown
Then I start smiling as I look around
As I realised (ey)
We really out here, we winning
We been the same but we different
Take my advise, just start living
These days I've been on a mission
Just trynna catch all my visions
We've been this shit for a minute
If you a fake then just listen (ey,ey)
You was never part of the gang gang gang
You was never one of us
And shout out to my boy Kabs
Been showing you no love!

Fuck all those that doubt
We just living out our dreams

I don't dissapate (ayyy)
I don't ever hesitate (okay)
All I do is captivate
I don't need to imitate
Keep it coming with your hate
Nature don't retaliate (he don't)
I don't have to seal your fate
It's already too late (ice, ice)
Nigga Nature got the sauce
Like Lebron I'm a boss (sauce, sauce)
If I ever take a loss
I just deny at all costs (costs, costs)
Nature and Ace always kill it
We ain't got no competition (gang gang)
We the rookies of the year
Like Dono Mitch and Ben Simmons
(huh? what?)
Boss up on a bitch
All you niggas switching sides
We don't need your fucking clique
If you ever try to switch
Imma hit you with that stick
Imma hit you with that stick
If you ever try to switch
All these niggas they be fake
