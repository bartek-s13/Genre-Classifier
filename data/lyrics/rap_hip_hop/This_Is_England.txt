I'm from where Reggie Kray got rich as fuck
East London, who am I to mess tradition up?
Jellied eels, pie and mash, two pints of that Pride on tap
Polo top, pair of stans, flat cap and a Burberry mac
Some ASBO kids on the crack here
Super tenants on a park bench, brown packet
Yeah, that's the hood, yeah, that's the hood
I'm just a 2Pac nigga in a town full of Suges
Tryna be straight in this town full of crooks
Know when you've never seen a man buy a Bentley with a book
We take to water like a duck, headed to the green
But getting caught up in the rough
Story of my life, and I'm just giving you the crux

The wheels keep on turning, we keep on earning
Streets lead to wars and spies
Be sure we keep on moving forward
Straight, straight as the arrows fly

Back when Lethal Bizzle was Lethal B
This is how we used to dun the dance in East
We used to spit 16s til they called police
Probably somewhere in a party or a dark shebeen
This is England, this is England
Where you could be a villain or a victim
Where you make money, make it out, avoid pen
That's the idiot's guide to the manor, my friend

Uh, it's been a long time coming, like Sam said
A change gonna come for the masses
Bars back, give that dark shit a damn rest
Rap for the have-nots and the have-less
This my Rocky stairway flow
Something those Apollos wouldn't know
Brother and a mother, where's Daddy?
Ah, fuck it, same old, same old
Face bothered, suit, three piece, Nucky Thompson
Fight against the odds to the top like Jack Johnson
You can keep the more money if you keep the problems
I can keep it real, can you keep it 100?
Just bought a soda pound sign said
Stripped and underground, king of his highness
Now what will come first, getting rich or the dying?
The tears or the violins?

The wheels keep on turning, we keep on earning
Streets lead to wars and spies
Be sure we keep on moving forward
Straight, straight as the arrows fly

Probably somewhere in a party or a dark shebeen
This is England, this is England
Where you could be a villain or a victim
Where you make money, make it out, avoid pen
That's the idiot's guide to the manor, my friend

It's not a hip hop party without a butt twerk
It's not a real rap song without a cuss word
It's not a house party without a shuffle
It's not a garage rave without champagne
Back when Wiley was Wiley Kat
This was how we used to get the party gassed
CS, get the party gassed
Then you covered your face and dossed out the back

I'll tell you, back when Lethal Bizzle was Lethal B
This is how we used to dun the dance in East
We used to spit 16s til they called police
Probably somewhere in a party or a dark shebeen
This is England, this is England
Where you could be a villain or a victim
Where you make money, make it out, avoid pen
