Pull up in the whip and I skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
One more-, one more time back to work, work, work
She don't hit my line so I just blur blur blur
Gotta get it right with no word, word, word
Yeah, no word word word

Swimming underwater like Nirvana
Try to bring me down I know you wanna
Lotta new things but things are nada
I'm scared to see what comes with all these dollars

I be working, working, working, never dropping
Yeah, she wanna let me know how she feels, it's exhausting
I be working working, working, never talking
She wanna see me, girl, I feel exhausted

Hitting my line shit, I don't have time for this, baby
One more-, more time shit, I don't wanna time shit baby
One of a kind shit, yeah, you are mine, oh baby (yeah, yeah)
Lil shawty, yeah, she got demeanor

Once or twice I hit you when I'm free, ah
Yet you always hit me on my lina
Weed smoking, burning like a sauna
I am underwater like nirvana
With all the shit I've done, I have bad karma
Yeah, waiting for me, waiting for me
Swimming underwater like Nirvana
Try to bring me down I know you wanna
Lotta new things but things are nada
I'm scared to see what comes with all these dollars

Pull up in the whip and I skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
One more-, one more time back to work, work, work
She don't hit my line so I just blur blur blur
Gotta get it right with no word, word, word
Yeah, no word word word
