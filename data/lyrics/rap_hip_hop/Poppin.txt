You know what the fuck it is...
It's that bitch, with the big titties from the Motor City
Yo,...
If you ain't got no haters you ain't poppin' nigga

If you ain't got no haters, you ain't poppin'
If you ain't got no haters, you ain't poppin' nigga
If you ain't got no haters, you ain't poppin'
If you ain't got no haters, you ain't poppin' nigga

I taught these hoes that Gucci, Louis, Prada shit..
Now I'm the one these bitches just ain't fuckin' with
I danced for a year, made a quarter mill..
You been dancin' 5 years, you still can't pay yo bills
I played my ex-nigga like a game boy

Makin' basic ass pros
You and ya bestfriend shop at basic ass stores
Basically y'all ain't nothing but some basic ass hoes
Just copped a new crib a couple thousand square feet, heated floors so I walk around this bitch bare feet
And you still fucked up, It's fucked up where you live
And you still with that ham ass nigga and bad kids
See I move like a boss, you just tryna' stay alive
I don't need a car cause I fly, more than I drive

Cinderella ass bitch, I'm your fairy boss mother
Kash Dolllllllll
