Gone
Gone
Gone
Gone
I’m gone
Gone
At Night I Wonda
Why Them Bullets Ain't Hit Me
Why The Fuck They Miss Me?
Rather Be Gone Take Me Out My Mothafuckin Misery
Walking Alone
Still Having Visions Of Em Killing Me
Fragments All In My Arm
But I Don't Need To Dodge The Enemy
Still Ain't No Fear In Me
Close My Eyes And I See TP
Traumatized
Tears In My Eyes
I Ain't Getting Sleep
Detectives Try To Frame Me
Interrogation
They Blame Me
Wish I Could Take It Back To The Day That My Mama Named Me
Never Underestimate The Competition
Screaming Fuck The Opposition
Still Disappointed
How They Catch Us Slippin?
Wish I Woulda Listened
Its Too Late For All That
Don’t Call My Phone
Wit No Bad News
I Can’t Take All That
What’s Gon’ Happen Behind This Shit ?
I Can’t Say All That
They Tellin’ Me To Pray
I Just Pray My Dawg Shake  Back
Ask The Lord To Keep Me Covered
So Much Love For My Brothers
Aye Baby Tay
They Gone Pay
And I Put That On My Mother
Purple Heart For Them Soldiers
Niggas Gone Feel Us
Gotta Make It Out
Before They Come And Kill Us
Lion Hearted I’mma soldier
Gotta Change The Way I’m Living
Mama Stressing And I Know Just How She Feelin
But I Was Raised To Be A Soldier
Ain’t Letting Up
Niggas Better Second Guess
Befo They Fuck Wit Us
You Shaken Back Boy You A Soldier
Aye Baby Tay, I Love Ya
NLMB, I’ll Never Leave My Brothers
All I hear Is Shots
So I Duck
What The Fuck
I Guess It’s Just My Goddamn Luck
Feel Like I’m Stuck
Can’t Shed A Tear
I'm More Angry Than Anything
Tell Me Can You Feel My Pain?
Chevy Arm In A Slang
He Got Hit Tryna Cover Me
I Know He Got Love For Me
Forever He Stuck Wit Me
Let ’em Talk
They Know What’s Up Wit

Think They Gone Be Smoking Me
Nigga You Ain’t Rollin’ Me
No, it ain’t no RIP
My Niggas Gone Die Wit Me
Sleepless Counts
Lesson Learned
Tables Turn
Bridges Burn
Can’t Be In A Rush To Die
Lil Nigga Just Wait Yo Turn
I Got Three Angels In The Sky
That Died From Gun Fire
They Watching Over Us
Now A lot Of Tears I Can’t Cry
Purple Heart For Them Soldiers
Niggas Gone Feel Us
Gotta Make It Out Before They Come And Kill Us
Lion Hearted  I’mma Soldier
