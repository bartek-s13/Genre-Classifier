They say one door open when another door close
I'm prayin' that's the way that it goes
'Cause right when I'm 'bout to turn the door knob
It seems it's all locked up and the key decomposed
Remind me this the life that I chose
Go full speed
I can't read the signs that say stop

I brush it off and try to act all nonchalant, yeah
I notice everything, I just act like I don't

But I know what I want (I know)
Yeah, I know what I want (just what)
But I know what I want (I want)
But I know what I want (don't tell me, 'cause...)

You swear that you're grown
It's 5 in the morning
You won't call, or come home
I'm getting really tired of it
All up in my phone, boy, leave it alone
And I'm learning, now I know
Should have left your ass in the friend zone
