Yeah
And it was just a dream
Uh

My top laid back, got my shades pulled down
Let my RedTape burn, girl light the whole town
We ‘gon light the whole town, girl I’m soon to be King keep a cup fulla Crown
Got my top laid back, got my shades pulled down
Let my RedTape burn, girl light the whole town
We ‘gon light the whole town, now soon to be King keep a cup fulla Crown

If this ain’t livin’ why should I bother to breathe
Change a season main reason I’m leavin’ speedin’ down the interstate
Gotta fill my dinner plate concentrate while I demonstrate
Pardon my juggernaut jargon only tryin’ to innovate
I see you're fake, body language sayin’ hate
Why your baby mama late, I ain’t let her in the room
I ain’t tryin’ to get no brain, baby failed right outta school
And you went and scooped her up she got you lookin’ like a fool
Marathon game weak not in my crew
First place Ray took the gold my dude
Slow up before the finish line like I’m ‘posed to
Got your personal best lookin’ real slow dude
…We bout to blow so cliché
Keep your Ray Bans on yall when you see Ray
The boy shinin’, he been grindin’
RIP to my Grandparents they my lineman

My city at night is so beautiful, beautiful
Hit it for a little baby please watch your cuticle
Good vibes miniscule, his lies it’s pitiful
The sidelines there he go, primetime never though
Einstein subliminals I’m fine wine hospitable
These other dudes expendable I bet you’re really bendable
Lemme see you bounce your ass to my syllables
Lemme see each cheek move in separate intervals
Centerfold on the side baby if you don’t mind
…You really want all my time
You think you worth all that juss cause your ass fat you ‘gon need more than that
