Flower eyes, power lines follow'n your energy
Let's see, where you lead
Lashes like petals stack us all together
Blown away in a dandelion breeze
Flower eyes paralyzed by your gaze and currents currently
electricity
Flower eyes chlorophyll filled, stoned still emerald green
Shocking still to see

Walk me through the meadow
Flower eyes, power lines
Walk me through the meadow
Walk me through the meadow
Flower eyes, power lines
Walk me through the meadow

Flower eyes, I'll survive, I'll be fine
You know, my roots are deep
Isn't that why you chose me
Strike me like a lightning bug landing on a leaf plant it all with me
Flower eyes paralyzed by your gaze and currents still electricity
Lashes like petals act like water color
It's on paper if you bleed
Shook my touch, your nucleus
Shook my touch, your nucleus
Shook my touch, your nucleus
Shook my touch, your nucleus
Shook my touch, your nucleus
Shook my touch, your nucleus
Shook my touch, your nucleus
Shook my touch, your nucleus

Flower eyes, power lines
Follow'd your energy
Just to see where it would lead
Flower eyes, iI can feel my heart beat swift in speed
You did this for me, you knew, what I'd need
Hey, flower eyes, how can I pass this energy
Like oxygen from trees, baby, I'll make you breathe
Flower eyes, flower eyes, flower eyes, flower eyes
Flower eyes, power lines, flower eyes, power lines
