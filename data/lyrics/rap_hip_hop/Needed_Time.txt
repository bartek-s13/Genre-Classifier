When it's all said and done you know you didn’t wait on me
I coulda gave you all of me but you took your love away from me
And I don't wanna be the one to have to say sorry
But you know my pride gets the best of me
You know I'd rather sleep on it

You used to come through, come through
When I’d push you'd always pull through
So when did things change?
You know you made me this way
You used to come through, come through
When I'd push you'd always pull through
So when did things change?
You know you made me this way

How could I give it all if you take from me?
And we ain't gotta talk, just wait on me
I just needed time, time and patience, yeah
How could I give it all if you take from me?
And we ain't gotta talk, just wait on me
I just needed time, time and patience, yeah

Hold tight and tell me to let it go
Pushin' words upon me, I want you close
I'd do the same and make a meal alone
Say you love me but you gotta let it show

We don’t mix match, we attract, we like magnets
You start, I kick off and it’s a madness
You gwan like you take man for granted
Diss man then you beg man for chances
You know I gave you all that you need
When nothing ever comes for free, yeah yeah
You coulda made it easy for me
When you used to

You used to come through, come through
