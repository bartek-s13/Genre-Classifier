Not takin' your crap anymore
I’ve had it up to here with you, bitch
Yeah, I'm gonna line my coke up by the road
Take a deep breath and exercise my nose
I'm gonna line my coke up by the road
Take a deep breath and exercise my nose

I got my uncles on the meth
My aunties on the crack
Little cousin stealing tobacco
Man, I wish that I was black
I’m the real Dirty Dan, ha
Shotgun in my hand
Prosecute your ass if I catch you on my land

And I got the John Deere runnin'
I got the John Deere runnin'
And I got the John Deere runnin'
I got the John Deere runnin'

Ridin' on a tractor
Make the traffic madder
Honkin' on their horns
I just treat ‘em like they're Casper
This my last gear, bitch
I can’t go no faster
Shoutgun loaded
Just Incase I run into a bastard
Ridin’ on a horse, ha
Carrying  a torch, ha
I don't need a whore ‘cause that’s what my sisters for
Close that fuckin' door, bitch
Don't come out no more, ha
You can't come outside until you finish up your chores

And I got the John Deere runnin’
I got the John Deere runnin'
And I got the John Deere runnin'
I got the John Deere runnin'

Yeah, I'm gonna ride my tractor up the road
I'm gonna ride and make the traffic slow
I'm gonna ride my tractor up the road
I'm gonna ride and make the traffic slow
