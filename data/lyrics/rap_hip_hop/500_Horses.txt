Feel like Danny Ocean, yeah

Back in my city first thing I did was hit the cemetery
I talk to my niggas pour me out some liquor
Tears shed in my head I'm really ready
I ain't worried 'bout nobody's enemies
Got the trusty dusty on me if it's heavy
Got a plan like Eddy, getting plenty fetti
And I still serve, serve Ben & Jerry
Got these bitches surf turf wet as levees
Now she looking for love like it's February
You could check my first work very scary
Always legendary never secondary, to the game I'm married
I gave all my heart to the money 'cause the paper never petty
Hope they don't forget me when I'm gone
When I do, I hope Hell or Heaven got some Henny
I heard so and so had got popped
You know down the block, niggas got the drop
When the cops pull up the talking stops
You know shit is hot niggas getting caught
Drugs in abundance the canines bark
But you can't arrest everyone in the park
Move with some wisdom, the youngin' smart
That's why I could survive out here after dark
I don't fuck with you you niggas marks
Word around town you work with narcs
When the pound hit I just make it spark
Hoping that my sound get me onto the charts
Used to take trips to hit a zone
Now I really take trips I'm far from home
I am not broke you got brittle bones
If you getting to it you are not alone

My life is moving like 500 horses
Think I'm addicted to riding in Porsches
I never stoppin', my business in motion
Out for the big score like I'm Danny Ocean

My niggas moving without any motion
My niggas pull up and kill the commotion
My niggas got your bitch wet as an ocean
My niggas put down the pound when we smoking, no joking
My niggas up and we gotta keep going
My niggas real wondering why you lil' niggas keep loafing
I swear this shit ain't been the same out here since we lit up
These bitches try to line you up once you get up
I pour an eighth and take sip out the big cup
But I won't slip up quicker than a lil' hiccup
I don't deliver no more only do pickups
And this a marathon lil' boy get your wind up
These dollar signs the only thing that can fill us
So everyday I'm asking God to forgive us
