It's new.  It's out of the ordinary
It's rather extrordinary, so yo bust this commentary
A literary genius and a superior beat creator
Have come together and we made a
Musical composition which we think is a remedy
To cure all the dance floors that's empty
You wanna dance? We got what you want
Jazzy Jeff and Fresh Prince bustin out with the brand new funk
It was kind of an accident, the way that it happened
One day I was rappin, and on the beat, Jeff was backin me up
And all of a sudden, he brought in a cut
And I dropped my microphone and said, "What the...?
Hold up, Jeff, wait a minute, play it"
He just smiled and said, "Yeah def ain't it?"
It was {funky} it made wanna {get, get down!}
And we knew almost at once it was the {brand new funk}
So we continued to listen to it
And we knew it was def when I started rappin to it
So I gave a hi-five to Jeff
And without hesitation popped in my cassette
I took it home that night, and analyzed it
Rewound the tape over and over, and memorized it
That Friday, we went to the club
And out and out cold tore it up!
You shoulda seen the people dancin and shakin and movin and jumpin
And spinnin and clappin, while the beatbox was groovin
And screamin and yellin while on the microphone I was flowin
Fresh rhymes I was showin, the people say, "Yo keep goin"
So I continued to rock, while Jeff was on the beatbox
Special assistance from my homeboy Ready Rock
People fought just to get up front
To get a bird's eye view of what we call the brand new funk
Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat}
Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat}
Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat}
* Jazzy Jeff cuts and scratches *
Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat}
Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat}
Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat with your hands..}
* Jazzy Jeff cuts and scratches *
Now get funky with the beat!
* Jeff starts spinning backwards *
Now turn it all around!
The most original, amazing, astounding, miraculous
Remarkable, startling, sensational, stupendous
Music that has ever been created
Is ours - but believe me it was complicated
But we have done it, so now we can breathe
A long awaited sigh of relief
This isn't a publicity stunt
It's the raw, untouched, pure, hard brand new funk!
{Rock the beat}
