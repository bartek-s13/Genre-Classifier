<<<<<<< HEAD
A lotta girls out here talking about ya
Men lie, women lie, I don't mind it
Thoroughbred, gave me no reason to doubt ya
It's not like I'm allowed to be jealous
If I am, you know I'm gonna hide it
Keepin' my composure when they constantly try me
All up in your image, stop faking that shit
You don't pay it no mind unless it's making you rich, damn

I've gone rogue, I've gone rogue
And I ain't coming back now
I took notes, I took notes
And I'm tired of being let down

You can be honest with me, babe
Be honest with me, babe
I have to let you know I'm built that way
So give it to me straight
Just give it to me, babe
I'll handle it, you know I'm built that way

You're the only one I confide in
Long as you don't confine me
To the boundaries they try to place on us
Keep it pushin' when they to try put the brakes on us (Yeah)
Girl, you know I'm rock solid
They throw shade, but it's not my problem
We ain't tripping, no, no, not now or later
Middle finger to the haters that be tryna play us

I've gone rogue, I've gone rogue
And I ain't coming back now
I took notes, I took notes
And I'm tired of being let down

You can be honest with me, babe
Be honest with me, babe
I have to let you know I'm built that way, yeah
So give it to me straight
Just give it to me, babe
I'll handle it, you know I'm built that way

You know I'm built that way, I'm built that way
You know I'm built that way, I'm built that way
You know I'm built that way, I'm built that way

You can be honest with me, babe
Be honest with me, babe
I have to let you know I'm built that way, yeah
So give it to me straight
Just give it to me, baby
