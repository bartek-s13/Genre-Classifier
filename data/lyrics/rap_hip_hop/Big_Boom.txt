I got my bowl full of Froot Loops
I'm just lookin' for a clean spoon
I got my girl in the other room
Big dynamite, big boom
I got my bowl full of Froot Loops
I'm just lookin' for a clean spoon
I got my girl in the other room
Big dynamite, big boom

Fire up the tractor, now I'm ready to go
If it ain't ice cold beer, it's not goin' down my throat
Rode past my neighbor and I gave him a honk
Sometimes I really love my wife, and sometimes I really don't
I just wanna sling some hay and get paid
I'ma be a country boy until my dyin' day
When I die, bury me under a bale of hay
And tell them people I don't give a fuck 'bout what they say
When I plow my field, I'm comin' home
Drinkin' ice cold beer, eatin' tenderloins
Put on my new boots and hit the honky-tonk
We're gonna party all God damn night long

I got my bowl full of Froot Loops
I'm just lookin' for a clean spoon
I got my girl in the other room
Big dynamite, big boom
I got my bowl full of Froot Loops
I'm just lookin' for a clean spoon
I got my girl in the other room
Big dynamite, big boom

John Deere on thirty-twos
Me and my boys 'bout to make some deer stew
We pray to the Lord and plow these fields
Gotta Yeti cooler filled with ice cold beer (Hey, hey, hey)
Victory is all mine
Smokin' hot bitch, fucked her on the combine
Fucked her doggystyle, then I tried to break her spine
Then I fixed her car and told her "Baby, you're ready to ride"
Then I made some kick-ass homemade wine
Then I mixed my Coors Light with my moonshine
I'ma country boy, l'll be that way until I die
You know country boys make the world go around (Hey, hey, hey)

I got my bowl full of Froot Loops
I'm just lookin' for a clean spoon
I got my girl in the other room
Big dynamite, big boom
I got my bowl full of Froot Loops
I'm just lookin' for a clean spoon
I got my girl in the other room
Big dynamite, big boom

Fire up the tractor, now I'm ready to go
If it ain't ice cold beer, it's not goin' down my throat
Rode past my neighbor and I gave him a honk
Sometimes, I really love my wife, and sometimes I really don't
