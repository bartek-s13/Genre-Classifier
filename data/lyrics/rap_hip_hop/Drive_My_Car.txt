You can drive my car
Drive my car, yeah

You can drive my car
I don't let nobody do that
You don't have to love me
I won't put you through that
You can have my heart
I don't let nobody see that
I'll see you tomorrow
I'm not trippin', we can relax
Said I'm going far
But like everybody say that
You can have my heart
Even though you're gonna break that
(Why'd you have to break that?)
Ooh, why'd you have to break that?
Baby, I think that you meant to
I think that you meant to

Some things you just gotta leave in the past
'Cause some things never had a reason to last
But I vibe, vibe with you
Baby ain't no way to go and live in the past
'Cause some days never had a reason to last
But I vibe, vibe with you

Noooo
Gotta tell me nothing
I don't even need you, girl
Ohh, noo
I don't even need you, girl
I don't even need you, girl
I don't even need you, girl
Noooo

You can drive my car
I don't let nobody do that
You don't have to love me
I won't put you through that
You can have my heart
I don't let nobody see that
I'll see you tomorrow
I'm not trippin', we can relax
Said I'm going far
But like everybody say that
You can have my heart
Even though you're gonna break that
(Why'd you have to break that?)
Ooh, why'd you have to break that?
Baby, I think that you meant to
