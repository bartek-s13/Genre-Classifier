You kept to yourself
I couldn't find you
A sign of the times
Because you walked the line
I'm over the act
I couldn't tempt you
I numbed my brain
As you unclogged the drain
Now run it

You're still haunting me
It sounds unfounded
Although it's apathy
What goes around you see
Breaks the boundaries
Walk with a smile
And it's all just a style
Since you put me on trial today

Why should I just walk away
For you to come around another day?
Waiting for the time we will collide
When I meet you on the other side

Ships in the night
Right in front of me
Accepted your slight
Though your answer was trite
I reached for the phone
But couldn't vent to you
I numbed my brain
As you unclogged the drain
Now run it

We're losing our honesty
Yet my virtue's not promising
And I thought you were harnessing
Your God-given artistry
Your God-given artistry

Why should I just walk away
For you to come around another day?
Waiting for the time we will collide
When I meet you on the other side
Why should I just walk away
For you to come around another day?
Keep you in the side of my eye
It may be on
On the other side


Why should I just walk away
For you to come around another day?
Waiting for the time we will collide
When I meet you on the other side
Why should I just walk away
For you to come around another day?
Keep you in the side of my eye
It may be on
On the other side

When you find yourself
Inside a living hell
The moment always lies
And when you find yourself
Inside a living hell
The moment never dies
