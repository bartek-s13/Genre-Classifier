In this room, sits a remarkable women
She's Miss Helen Keller
She does not hear the rustling of the curtains behind her
She hears nothing

Might kill the scene when I roll up
Might make some green and get my gold up
Might have have to prove what I told ya
I'm too woke but they sleepin' like a coma
Ooh
Damn that boy he got the waves
Damn that boy he on the way
Got got a couple baes, they just want a little taste
But I ain't really got the time to save
Nah nah nah
On a roll like Michelin I got the Midas touch
Grammy in my hand that's that shit I might just touch
I don't need no help cause I got guidance from above
Reachin', reachin' in pocket that's my way of finding love
It's only a little now but watch and wait and see
Only thing I need in life is watches cake and green
Let your favorite rapper make his spot a vacancy
Put my fam up on a private beach
Yea that's a vacant sea yea

I remember when they used to talk I always listened
But I don't hear nothing now
And old girls still be tryna tell me what I'm missing
But I don't hear nothing now
Nah I don't hear nothing
Nah nah nah nah
Nah I don't hear nothing
Nah nah nah nah

Helen Keller I ain't hearin' nothin'
Poker face I know these rappers bluffin'

They hit up DM's say "I'm sick need robattussin"
Like wooo
Yea I been doing things yea
Yea I been counting change yea
Yea I been tryna' save yea
Investing every penny
Need a Benz in my lane
They can see the money coming quicker than a virgin
Cuttin' up these records every night like I'm a surgeon
Life just keep on getting better I just keep on learning
How to deal with snakes like my name is Stephen Irwin
These days they wanna know how it happened
They see my name and they know that I'm snappin'
Started from the roots like I'm Jimmy Fallon
Late nights in the booth Jimmy Fallon
Yea Yea

I remember when they used to talk I always listened
But I don't hear nothing now
And old girls still be tryna tell me what I'm missing
But I don't hear nothing now
Nah I don't hear nothing
Nah nah nah nah
Nah I don't hear nothing
Nah nah nah nah
