Uh (Yeah-yeah)

West coast thrillin', all night chillin'
Smoking through the morning to suppress these feelings
Streets so vivid, people so livid
Not a soul safe in the world that we're living
No pop pillin', backwood sealing
But my brother staring at a styrofoam ceiling
East coast feeling, I don't like to feel it
So I spend my morning staring at the earth's ceiling

I know you won't miss me, like I miss you
'Cause I'm a fuckin' fool
I know you won't miss me, like I miss you
'Cause I'm a fuckin' fool

That's that, shawty snapped
This time think she don't want me back
That's that, that's that (Yeah, damn)
That's that, shawty snapped
This time think she don't want me back
That's that, that's that (Damn)
Time passed, too fast
Next year think I'm going up next
That's that, that's that (Yeah)
Let bygones, be bygones
We don't gotta shed tears no more
We don't gotta shed tears no more
And I left home, I hope that's cool
I'm in west L.A., I've been acting a damn fool
Like that's cool, like that's cool
I don't wanna go back to the damn east coast
Goin' ghost, give a toast to my brand new post (Woah)
And I don't needa sell my soul
(Next year think I'm going up next)
I know all good things gotta come to an end
But I'm 19, swearing that it's all pretend
Think I lost my mind and I lost my friends
But I'm 19, swearing that it's all pretend, woah-oh

I know you won't miss me, like I miss you
'Cause I'm a fuckin' fool
You won't miss me, I promise you
'Cause I'm a fuckin' fool
I know you won't miss me, like I miss you
You don't miss me like I miss you
'Cause I'm a fuckin' fool

That's that, shawty snapped
This time think she don't want me back
That's that, that's that (Yeah, damn)
Time passed, too fast
Next year think I'm going up next
That's that, that's that (Damn)
That's that, shawty snapped
This time think she don't want me back
That's that, that's that
Let bygones, be bygones
We don't gotta shed tears no more
We don't gotta shed tears no more
West coast thrillin', all night chillin'
Smoking through the morning to suppress these feelings
Streets so vivid, people so livid
Not a soul safe in the world that we're living
No pop pillin', backwood sealing
Seventh mornin' staring at a styrofoam ceiling
East coast feeling, I don't like to feel it
So I spend my morning staring at the earth's ceiling
West coast thrillin', all night chillin'
Smoking through the morning to suppress these feelings
Streets so vivid, people so livid
Not a soul safe in the world that we're living
No pop pillin', backwood sealing
Now my brother staring at a styrofoam ceiling
East coast feeling, I don't like to feel it
So I spend my morning staring at the earth's ceiling
