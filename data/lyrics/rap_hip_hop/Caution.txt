<<<<<<< HEAD
Drippin', saucin', yeah lil bitch I do this often
My bitch is bad, she always in office
Don't got the tags, don't rent 'em, I bought it
Can't see the past, I'm livin' too fast, 220 my dash, I'm hopin' I lost 'em
He wanna brag, I emptied his bag and took what he had, don't care what it cost him
Think he ya bro, he turn to a hoe, I've seen this before, this shit get exhausting
Ran outta hope, I wanna be known, they snatchin' my soul, yeah, Randy Moss 'em
Already been broke, I'm better alone, don't need me a hoe, I hit 'em and toss 'em
I lit it woah, you know that I know, you gon' get exposed, proceed with caution

Ran up a check and go buy a baguette, neck gettin' wet and it drip like a faucet
Up when I rest, see these demons, they crept, bloody my step, now I'm staining the carpet
Makin' a mess, look up at the crest, I smoke up a check and I'm higher than martians
Mama upset, she say I'm depressed, apply all the pressure 'cause I made a bargain
Buy a new whip, I won't park it, won't need a key 'cause I push it to start it
I got my eye on the target, I went too deep and I don't have a harness
Two of me, one just departed, soon as I make it they'll say I'm a harvest
2500 my garments, turned to a demon, I started an artist
I lit the flame, sparked it, tired of trash, it's flooding the market
Put him in bag 'cause he ain't the sharpest
Now he get mad, he want what they all want
I need a hit, yeah, I want one
Need to do better, I'm better when on one
I need a drink, bitch, pour me a tall one
Hope I can heal my soul before it's all done

Drippin', saucin', yeah lil bitch I do this often
My bitch is bad, she always in office
Don't got the tags, don't rent 'em, I bought it
Can't see the past, I'm livin' too fast, 220 my dash, I'm hopin' I lost 'em
