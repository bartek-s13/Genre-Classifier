Yeah, yeah

No, I ain't on the East, but I miss my mama there
Gas in the BNB, we do this everywhere
Landlord come knocking, we don't really care, nah
'Cause in the morning we'll be out of here
Woah, then in the morning I'll be out your hair
'Cause I don't really care, you know I don't play too fair

I know you're feeling down, wishing I was still around
I ain't seen you in years, girl, we ain't 17
Our love is faded in my memory
And I've been on to big and better things

Girl, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta, yeah
You gotta, you gotta, you gotta, you got
You gotta, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta, yeah

You gotta know yourself
Put all these hoes below yourself
You gotta show yourself
Just do this shit for no one else

I know you're feeling down, wishing I was still around
I ain't seen you in years, girl, we ain't 17
Our love is faded in my memory
And I've been on to big and better things

Flying away, over
Long rainy days, hate being sober
And now this girl is all in my face, you get no love
At night, we come out to play, you can't control us
And my gang 'bout to roll up, ooh
I'm riding with my soldiers, yeah
My double cup be poured up, woah
She like when I control her, oh
These niggas hatin' from the other side, yeah
I tell 'em pull up to the West side, yeah
This ain't back then, girl, you can't stay the night
I'm sorry, but you have to catch a flight, yeah
I met a new girl, we was gettin' high, it's a vibe
Girl, we ain't 17, why you still actin' like we tight?
I blew up, now I'm famous, she tell every girl, "He mines"
Can't let go of the past, you stuck on tryna press rewind
And that's why I'm flying away, over
Long rainy days, hate being sober
And now this bitch is all in my face, she get no love
At night, we come out to play, you can't control us, ooh, ooh

I know you're feeling down, wishing I was still around
I ain't seen you in years, girl, we ain't 17
Our love is faded in my memory
And I've been on to big and better things

I know you're feeling down, wishing I was still around
