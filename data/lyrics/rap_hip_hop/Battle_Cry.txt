I know these niggas never been a hundred, they let that fame switch 'em
Did all that preachin' 'bout bein' solid, then you changed, nigga
I'm from that 1300 block, I'm still the same nigga
They know how I bleed, swear this shit up in my veins, nigga
I looked my brother in his eyes, I seen the pain in 'em
Boy, I won't play, I'll go to war about my gang members
I was in the trenches slidin' with them grave diggers
Chopper showers, he gon' fall once that rain hit him

Addicted to this ecstasy, I like how it feel
It's like I been poppin' X ever since I tried a pill
Shit got me through some hard times, I lost my mind for real
Lot of shit happened way too fast, I ain't have time to heal
Ed was gon' make it on that court but he died in the field
I was still hangin' in the hood before I signed a deal
Posted on Hudson, jakes ridin' past, I had my nine concealed
Hot 'nem do no talking, they just spark shit when it's time to drill
Lil Stank so reckless, he ride fast when he behind the wheel
My shorties hot, keep bending blocks, they gon' slide with the steel
We lost some soldiers in that war so they been tryin' to kill
I be dolo with my ice on, I been tryin' to chill

Ain't no playin' both sides over here, please make your mind up and choose
Bitches cheerleadin' and then they sneak dissin', I think they sort of confused
Please stop runnin' your mouth, that's how brothers go missin' and niggas get put on the news
You goin' through it, you losin' it, huh? My shorties eager to tighten your screws
Them blickers go off like alarms, but you ain't wakin' up if you snooze
Niggas be clowns, puttin' on shows for the media, I don't be shit but amused
I won't forget 'bout that lil' shit you said, we gon' get you for frontin' your move
My shootas some hell-raisers, come through clappin' broad, they don't give a fuck 'bout the rules
I played the block, went on them drills by my lonely, I had the four-oh up in school
Fightin' anxiety so I kept spendin' my last on all of the drugs I abuse
Down on my ass, they ain't give a fuck about me, I felt like I ain't have nothin' to lose
Now I'm in my bag, just tryna run up these millis 'cause I ain't got nothin' to prove
