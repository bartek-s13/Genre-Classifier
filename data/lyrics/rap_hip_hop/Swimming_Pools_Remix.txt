I’m way past gone and I just see the bottom of this bottle
I just woke up to a room full of models who know that I ain’t calling them tomorrow
It’s been so long since I've been on this level right here
Waking up, after I passed out, I put my clothes on before I mash out

Cause I been losing my mind, wasting my time, fucking these hoes and sipping this wine
Skipping the line to get inside, buying the bottle and feeding them lies
Shawty say she need a ride, I tell her cool and get ready to slide
Into my room, I hit her from behind, doing again like I’m pressing rewind

Cause I ain’t never babysitting, I been lining up shots
I’mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles then I watch them all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor, I’mma dive in it, oh
Pour up, drank, head shot, drank
Sit down, drank, stand up, drank
Pass out, drank, wake up, drank
Faded, drank, faded, drank

I’m way past gone from the partying and bullshit
Don’t remember where I’m at in a room full of bitches, music playing in the back
Damn, time for me to get gone cause I ain’t supposed to be here
Feeling faded, I’m so intoxicated and your girl say she feeling X rated, I'm gone

Cause I been losing my mind, wasting my time, fucking these hoes and sipping this wine
Skipping the line to get inside, buying the bottle and feeding them lies
Shawty say she need a ride, I tell her cool and get ready to slide
Into my room, I hit her from behind, doing again like I’m pressing rewind

Cause I ain’t never babysitting, I been lining up shots
I’mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles then I watch them all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor, I’mma dive in it, oh
Pour up, drank, head shot, drank
Sit down, drank, stand up, drank
Pass out, drank, wake up, drank
Faded, drank, faded, drank
