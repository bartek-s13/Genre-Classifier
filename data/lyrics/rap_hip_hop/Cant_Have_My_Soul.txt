Verse1
Go on tell em how it is, this world’s gone crazy/
How the heck we debating killin' babies?/
And I hope I piss a lot of people off/
Defend it how you like but you still killin' babies/
Twist it, that’s what the devil does/
Inch by inch we take it how it comes/
That ain’t religion talking that’s real life/
That’s double edged sword yeah real Knife/
Uh, &amp; we sick to the bone/
Detox now gotta kill what I’ve become/
Habits - gotta beat em like a drum/
Addicts - gotta turn around &amp; run/
That is the only way you gone make it/
Just cause they feed it to the world don’t mean you gotta take it/
This fast food generation got young bloods trippin'/
Eyes wide shut they ain’t catchin' me slipping'/
Chorus
You can’t have my soul
You can’t have my soul
You can’t have my soul
You can’t have my soul
Verse 2
I said the spirit is willin' but the body is weak/
So everyday I wake up I try and stay asleep/
Don’t let em get it twisted, I don’t mean Z’s/
I told you on my last record Jesus is my dream/
Uh, so sweet dreams, and good night/
And rest them weary bones for the good fight/
We got wicked hearts, and the flesh fails/
Ever heard a little term called “Sex Sells”/
Now we got 40 million people watchin' porno/
It didn’t happen over night that was slow mo/
They gave em just a little bit, kept comin' back/
Then increased the dosage, similar to crack/
Uh, and there’s a lonely child stuck in the hood/
Hangin' with brotha’s that’s up to no good/
So watch and pray, like all day/
Or temptation’s gonna shape you up the hard way/
Chorus
You can’t have my soul
You can’t have my soul
You can’t have my soul
You can’t have my soul
Verse 3
Last verse I’m goin' in, in, Ay open up the window/
