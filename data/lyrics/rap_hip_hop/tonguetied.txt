I know you're tongue-tied
Don't let this high die
In the morning will you tell me that its all alright
I only love you when you're standing in the moonlight
Don't let this high die
Don't let this high die

Playing theses games, we going in circles again
I know there all fake, flashing fake smiles again
We playing theses game, we going in circles again
I know they're all fake, flashing fake smiles again

Let's pick it up from where we left off, yeah
You said something that went like fuck off, yeah
All these thots were knock offs, yeah
All these drugs keep me fucked up
Yeah I guess, we're just having some fun
Sugar coat the truth, what's the worst thing you've done
Taking all these pills just so I could feel numb
I'm always saying its the last fucking one

Playing theses games, we going in circles again
I know there all fake, flashing fake smiles again
We playing theses game, we going in circles again
I know there all fake, flashing fake smiles again
