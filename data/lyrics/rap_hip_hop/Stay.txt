STAY
Can't remember if I told ya
I like it when you Stay
X4
Stay with me
Stay the night
Stay awake
Stay polite
Let's stay young
Still grow
Stay fun
Build tho
Stay curvin' all these DMs w a "chiiiiill bro"
She stay missin the point but she still goals
She somebody who do both stay on your mind
I was last on stage and she stayed the whole time
She don't sweat it when I'm extra
She don't let it freak her out if I forget to text her
Dead it when I mess up
Bless it when I'm messed up
You make me wanna stay in shape
Stay side by side on a binge
I like it when you say my name I like it when you stay in case I forget again
Can't remember if I told ya
I like it when you say
I'm so happy to know ya
Cuz I feel the same way
Im not tryna control her
That's just how we play
She only wear black or gray
I love it when she bat her eyes
I don't mind being mad cliche
Don't dip, back away, leave or evacuate
Guarantee Ill be glad you stayed
