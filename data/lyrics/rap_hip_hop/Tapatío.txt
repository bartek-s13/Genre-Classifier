Tapatio, right now on fire
Put that on my soul, yeah on my life
Kicking through the door, don't know ya don't try
Don't want you to know, I ain't going outside
Never wanted you to go, but you left my side
You left me broken, it's eating me alive
Ima need more if I wanna feel right
Wish I'd go blind don't want these eyes

Man, love so god damn depressing
Anxiety been killin' me I'm always up stressing
It don't even help when people say that you next thing
And I ain't tryin' to be edgy when I say nobody gets me
This shit really get messy, paranoia expanding
Sipping drinks and expressing, worried about every damn thing
Demons in me are laughing, diamonds on me start dancing
Everyone started rapping, they don't know it's enhancing
Then the next thing you know, It's gon be a fight for your soul
As soon you let that shit go, the road ahead don't look so gorgeous
But they say it looks easy for me
Baby no this ain't easy for me
