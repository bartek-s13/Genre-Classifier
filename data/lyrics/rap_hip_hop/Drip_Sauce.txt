Young Kairo

These niggas talking through hashtags and be flexing, bitches know where the cash at
We rolling up with a pack, God, I get money, KJ told me to stack that
We came from nothing what you mad at? I don't pay attention where all the tags at
If I want it, man, I grab that, off the music I be making that bag bag
Different bottles when you see us, we pull up on niggas, and we got the spot turnt
I had to focus on music and give up the scamming 'cause of all of the spots burnt
I walk in the spot, nothing but bad bitches, see my chain and my watch first
Niggas comparing us to these other rappers, we gon' see who gon' pop first
I got the drip, sauce
We ain't playin', get you hit off (Sauce)
You see what this drip cost
Fifty bands got my wrist frost (It's all froze)
I ain't playing with nobody, it's war
If you moving hot on the tour (Movin' too hot)
My diamonds they shining, they flodge
I know that it's pissin' them off

I came up from nothing, that's PSA
I can't get all this money through TSA
If he run up, that's a DOA
Gwuapo told me get money and lead the way
Yeah I got the drip, sauce
Diamonds on me and they pissed off
Yeah I got the drip, sauce
Hop in the coupe and I dip off, skrrt
K Balla still stuntin
Off and up in different Porsches
You should know he got that
Wes Balla be cookin', saucin'
But just still be cautious
'Cause he won't give hearts back
I'ma fuck up the game and Maybachs
No sympathy, you gotta take that
They looking hard where my chains at
Dare a nigga try to take that (Yeah)
