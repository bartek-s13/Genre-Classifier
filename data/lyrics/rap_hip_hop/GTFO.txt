Promise you’ll be gone now
I can’t handle living it, anymore
Promise you’ll move on now
You say I was the one who ruined the girl from before
All you friends keeping telling me
Different lies you spoke on me
Talking down upon my name for comfort
If I take a swing you’re done for

All our fucking memories
Any time you’d message me
Ever fucking phone call
Telling me it’s her fault
Say you hate the sober me
Why can’t you get over me
Holding onto everything
Fucking every one you’d meet
Oh baby, I don’t wanna write no more
Bout your every fucking spite no more
But I’m asking from the bottom of my heart
Promise you’ll be gone now
I can’t handle living it, anymore
Promise you’ll move on now
You say I was the one who ruined the girl from before
All you friends keeping telling me
Different lies you spoke on me
Talking down upon my name for comfort
If I take a swing you’re done for
