Yeah, papi

I don't trust these niggas like I used to
Or hang out with the niggas that I used to
Don't open up to people like I used to
Put your guards down, that's when everybody use you
I don't trust these niggas like I used to
Or hang out with the niggas that I used to
Don't open up to people like I used to
Put your guards down, that's when everybody use you
You feel me?

Lately I been feeling gone, feeling long gone
Other days I be feeling lone, feeling lonesome
Call a hoe, tell her bring her friends, have a foursome
Call my niggas, have a get together we can blow some, pause
I'm talking about the green, you still talk about her
Now I'm talking about me
I remember how they never used to love me
And now they calling me a drug, can't get enough of me, damn
Remember I never forget a fact
Hoes ain't loyal my nigga, don't get attached
Snakes don't play my nigga just keep track
Soon as you turn your back that's when a nigga attack
And that's real
Secretly these niggas tryna kill me
That's why I can never show the real me
Niggas always talking but I'm still me
You feel me? Do you feel me?

I don't trust these niggas like I used to
Or hang out with the niggas that I used to
Don't open up to people like I used to
Put your guards down, that's when everybody use you
I don't trust these niggas like I used to
Or hang out with the niggas that I used to
Don't open up to people like I used to
Put your guards down, that's when everybody use you
You feel me?

You feel me? Yeah
You feel me? Uh
You feel me? Yeah
You feel me? Yeah
