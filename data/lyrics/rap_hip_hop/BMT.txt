Yo, BMT, I'm on a big man ting
I ain't going into clubs without my big hand ting
Got eleven on my finger, that's a big man ring
Yeah, I got a big bag, no bin man ting
See me jumpin' in the Porsches with them big back tings
All I really know for sure is I won't kiss that ting
Big man ting, my niggas tryna bring straps in
See them in some big jackets on some Big Shaq ting

BMT, my Rollie, that's a presi', not a GMT
I'm rolling with my black youngsters they're not CMG
I'm on my block or at the top, that's where you're seeing me
My nigga Stro servin' 3 on 3's out that GLE
My mummy told me that they're playing me on BBC
My youngins always doing shootings on a wheelie spree
So all they really got is dirt bikes like DBE
My teacher was a bitch, she never did believe in me (Huh?)
But now she's looking lost
'Cause her whole year's wages, that's my booking cost
Man, it feels like ages since I cooked a block
But that's 'cause I let young niggas jugg it off with C and them
Turned 18, I went to adult jail, I'm seeing men
Going in a cell for one-on-ones and there's three of them
Still I got it cracking, I'm never feeling wet
Got a brick off my ahki Khaled, nigga, we the best
Yo, BMT, I'm on a big man ting
I ain't going into clubs without my big hand ting
Got eleven on my finger, that's a big man ring
Yeah, I got a big bag, no bin man ting
See me jumpin' in the Porsches with them big back tings
All I really know for sure is I won't kiss that ting
Big man ting, my niggas tryna bring straps in
See them in some big jackets on some Big Shaq ting

Yo, big man ting, I'm on some big man stuff
You ain't never bought no bricks 'cause that's some big man grub
I'm in the G-Wagon, vanishing, big man trap
All my niggas are attracting is them big back sluts
Yo I'm jiggy-jiggy wid it, I'm busy-busy wid it
My nigga he gets lizzy wid it, now we're on a prison visit
Bombaclaat, man had some pretty girls, was scratchin' up my foreign car
Yo, that's a problem, dawg
But yo, big man ting
All I'm hearing these days is, "Can you bring man in?" (Huh?)
I was trapping all night and you weren't with that ting
You was outside ravin' on some wingman ting
Little silly pricks, and I got pretty chicks tryna send me images
Tryna make me finish with the missus
But I ain't gonna finish with the missus, she's the realest
Just come and bust it open once you're finished with the dishes
Yo, BMT, I'm on a big man ting
I ain't going into clubs without my big hand ting
Got eleven on my finger, that's a big man ring
Yeah, I got a big bag, no bin man ting
See me jumpin' in the Porsches with them big back tings
All I really know for sure is I won't kiss that ting
Big man ting, my niggas tryna bring straps in
See them in some big jackets on some Big Shaq ting
