We all hoped to be finding the light
We were alone on the Earth, searching for someone alike
Your words made sense with the truth you possessed
Believing the call of our kind would be fine if we were divinely blessed

You said we would be recycled
Took a hold of our souls just make us the same
Called me something I wasn't it's not just a name
Take your time taking minds just to stay in the game
Made me someone I wasn't it's not just a name

We couldn't love but you paired us together to walk hand in hand
The irony
We couldn't make this world ours because it wasn't a part of the plan

You said we would be recycled
You said i would be recycled
Took a hold of our souls just make us the same
Called me something I wasn't it's not just a name
Take your time taking minds just to stay in the game
Made me someone I wasn't it's not just a name

Why do we do, like you?
Why do we do?

Made me someone I wasn't it's not just a name
You called me something I wasn't it's not just a name
You made me someone I wasn't it's not just a name
You called me something I wasn't it's not just a name
