BUT YOU AIN'T GONNA FIND NON QUITE LIKE MINE
IT SEEMS LIKE YESTERDAY
YOU COULD BARLEY EVEN STAY AWAY
ALL THE NIGHTS WE WOULD STAY AWAKE
TELLING EM YOUR SECRETS STILL SAFE WITH ME NOW
I'VE NEVER BEEN THE KISS AND TELL TYPE
I'M TO ONE TO STAY FRIENDS FOR REAL LIKE
WE AIN'T COOL YOU A DOG FOR REAL RIGHT
SLOW AND STEADY NOT SOME OVERNIGHT HYPE
AND I DON'T HOLD A GRUDGE
RATHER SEE IT CLEAR FOR WHAT IT WAS
GO OUR OWN WAYS SOBER UP
AIN'T NO GOING BACK WHEN I CUT
AND SHE AIN'T GONNA LIKE IT EITHER
YOU GOTTA PUT IN WORK TO PLEASE HER
LEMME GUESS YOU GONNA LEAVE HER
CAUSE YOUR LOVE IS LIKE A TEASER
GOT A LITTLE TASTE AND THEN YOU GOT LAZY
THE YOU GOT COMFORTABLE, BARLEY EVEN TRY NO MORE
GOT A LITTLE TASTE AND THEN YOU GOT LAZY
THE YOU GOT COMFORTABLE, BARLEY EVEN TRY NO MORE
(GOT A LITTLE TASTE, DON'T GET BORED YOU GONNA LET IT GO TO WASTE, SO MUCH MORE THAN A BOOTY AND A FACE, YOU DON'T EVEN TRY NO MORE, YOU DON'T EVEN TRY NO MORE)
WHEN YOU'RE TIRED OF MAKING LOVE
BUT YOU BOTH KNOW WHAT IT WAS
IN THE MORNING AIN'T NO BUZZ
SHIT WAS CUTE TILL IT WASN'T
LET'S KEEP THIS HERE A THOUSAND
YOU WAS LAZY I ALLOWED IT
OPTIONS OPEN BUT THEY CLOUDED
IT'S NO WONDER YOU AIN'T FOUND IT
AND YOU'RE NEVER GONNA FIND SOME
DOING SO MUCH NUMBERS YOU FORGOT
SO NOW YOU ROUND UP
FIND YOURSELF A CHICK
DOWN TO BUILD IT FROM THE GROUND UP
SHE DON'T WANT THE D
SHE WANT A C NOTE LIKE THE SOUND YA
BETTER HOPE YOU NEVER FIND YOURSELF IN JAIL
SHE'LL BE FUCKIN' ON YOUR FRIENDS
INSTEAD OF POSTING ON YOUR BAIL
MAN SHE ONLY LEARNED TO TEXT
DON'T BE WAITING ON THE MAIL
TRY HARDER ON THE NEXT
AND I ONLY WISH YOU WELL
GOT A LITTLE TASTE AND THEN YOU GOT LAZY
THE YOU GOT COMFORTABLE, BARLEY EVEN TRY NO MORE
GOT A LITTLE TASTE AND THEN YOU GOT LAZY
THE YOU GOT COMFORTABLE, BARLEY EVEN TRY NO MORE
(GOT A LITTLE TASTE, DON'T GET BORED YOU GONNA LET IT GO TO WASTE, SO MUCH MORE THAN A BOOTY AND A FACE, YOU DON'T EVEN TRY NO MORE, YOU DON'T EVEN TRY NO MORE)
I AIN'T GONNA GIVE YOU LIFE
AND YOU AIN'T GONNA FIND NONE QUITE LIKE MINE
I KNOW ANOTHER CHICKEN MIGHT
BUT YOU AIN'T GONNA FINE NONE QUITE LIKE MINE
