I want to feel connected
Lock the doors
I'm staying out
Carefully selective
Lucky one
Or send it back
Lead me in the dark
Take me through
Just the way you are
Somewhere new
Want to be defensive
Slash and burn
It's nothing else
Build it up, direct it
Help me out
I'm panicking
Lead me in the dark
Take me through
Just the way you are
Somewhere new
Soon I'll be alone
And I'll stay under water
Soon I'll be alone
Don't say where you are
I can be alone
And I'll feel much better
Can't get along
What makes you think that I can?
Call you when I get there
Left a note
For everyone
Feel a bit rejected
Help me out
I'm panicking
Lead me in the dark
Take me through
Just the way you are
Somewhere new
