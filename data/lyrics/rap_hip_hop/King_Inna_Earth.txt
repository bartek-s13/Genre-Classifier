Sweet Music, 1Syde enuh... know eeh thing go
Man a King Inna Earth, anuh feel it you haffi know it
Yaffi understand it, get me?
Hold on den

Man a King Inna Earth
Just remember when you great them try fi fling you inna dirt
Wul heap a pain inna me heart, sweat inna me shirt
Long before mi top the chart &amp; di thing did a work
Mi did know seh
Man a King Inna Earth
Yow, me never drop the guard the whole city alert
Long before me stack the millions gyal pitney a flirt
Youth, go fi your crown, we a king from we birth ye

Life is a mystery, youth just be brave, fuck dem history we anuh slave
We a shout freedom fi di King dem inna di cage &amp; di queen dem weh waffi turn a better page
Yea me know poverty, mek we full a rage
But we affi wise up &amp; tek eeh stage
12 year old a travel wid a 12 gauge
Him mother still a suffer cuz a minimum wage
Yaffi dead fi go a heaven but me si seh hell raise
Watch dem a lock up di man fi sell grades
Solid we solid inna nuff we embrace
So when me say it dawg anuh self praise
Ay ghetto youth
Man a King Inna Earth
Just remember when you great them try fi fling you inna dirt
Wul heap a pain inna me heart, sweat inna me shirt
Long before mi top the chart &amp; di thing did a work
Mi did know seh
Man a King Inna Earth
Yow, me never drop the guard the whole city alert
Long before me stack the millions gyal pitney a flirt
Youth, go fi your crown, we a king from we birth ye

What a fuck if me did listen to mouth talk &amp; no follow me own heart
Never switch it up all when it rough &amp; the road dark
Deh ya fi mi family cyah mek them alone walk
Ay mama birth a king weh touch the stage &amp; the crowd spark
Mek some fuckry choices even though man so smart
Strap fi di fight them cyah cut my own short
Life, camera, action, yea man the show start
