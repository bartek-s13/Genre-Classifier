L.F.P.2 (Ji-Mix)
Ji-Mix
Introduce the world to the pre fix
See what I see through the cement
You bitches still be tweakin
Boiii I came to win
Ain’t no way we leaving even
One life to live
Swear to God that I’m eating
So miss with the hips pass the plate
You come after me
Like you run to masturbate
Bitch I told you I was after great
My lifelines
I can’t waste it
Still think a crime ain’t basic
When I can get a dime off the lyrics that I’m saying
So this is why I don’t got the time or the patience
That paper I’m still chasing
They say wait up on ya moment
I ain’t waiting no more
They sayin crime don’t play
While Im going to even the score
We still doing the most
So good that I boast
Lifeline turned Finnactz
I’ve been good with the quotes
In my hood the same name
Just a difference of dope
And I’m good with the folks
And the Cuzzos and the bloods
Still cool with it doe
I’m just as smoove as you know
A baby bottoms
Or lady condoms yeah she used them before
In a two door
With two whores
We ain’t feeling too bored
Smoking on some Newport’s
Feeling too sure
