<<<<<<< HEAD
I am that mix-breeded, star-seeded individual
Tripping on that residual DMT drippin from my pineal
Aligned with cosmic forces, I know the source is
Flowing through my soul, and to shed light on this earth is my goal, yeah
Foresight, three eyes, tonight, shivai
Create a vibration with my thoughts, I'm a god
And I will live my life anyway in which I decide
It's my design, this is where the dark and the light both reside
Eternally building my life with my heart in tune with my mind I go inside
Feel it resonating, waiting on no time
Present moment's got me focused on the divine
Deep breaths make the kundalini rise
And I become alive, as my chakras align
And you're focused on time? Well I'm livin this moment
And you're stuck in your mind? But don't it feel hopeless?
Yea, and I know you're tired of the fear
Open up your heart and bring all of your dreams here
Yeah, and I know you're tired of the lies
Open up your heart and speak your truth with one word, shivai
Open up your heart and speak your truth with one word, shivai
And I know you're tired of the lies, open up your heart and speak your truth
Stardust in my DNA, soul sent here from the blue ray
Stepped onto this planet, with the understanding
That nothing's gonna be the same
I'm here to change and take away the pain
This world's been a drought and I am the rain
Bring truth no doubts no fears to blame
I'm letting loose cause we're out and we're here to reign
Uh, and your mind will wane as your awareness now opens up to your heart
Part ways with destructive thoughts, allowing your soul to create a new start
And I know all these scars, are nothing but symbols of moments in time
And my journey's been far, awakened to truth I'm removing the blinds
Yea, and I know you're tired of the fear
Open up your heart and bring all of your dreams here
Yeah, and I know you're tired of the lies
Open up your heart and speak your truth with one word, shivai
One step at a time and I will find that I'm reaching divine
Levels of being because I've been seeing devils who have tried
And angels who have lost their wings and fallen from the skies
Caving then suppressing their truths just to live this world's lies
I am the observer, and this is duality
Life can give you hurdles, but maybe that's just how it seems
When you see it from both sides, then you know why
You're being pulled to try
Be aware that the moment is there, just to change the dark to light
And bring the day to night
Yeah, and that's why I know I am here
A star-seeded being transcending this third dimensional atmosphere
Yeah, and I know I will make my path clear
Shining light right through the front door of every home for fear
It's time to stop waiting, this is the awakening, yeah
This is the awakening
It's time to stop waiting, this is the awakening, yeah
This is our awakening
Out of sight, I'm in 5D
Turn the dark to the light when thoughts become reality
Take flight, lose the gravity
It's yourself you fight, when you place limits on your beliefs
Transforming these energies, I tend to see, that it's meant to be
That my light's shining on this darkness
Bringing endings to this planet's duality
In the depths of my soul I know, I will reap everything I've sown
With the death of my human ego, I'm watching my whole spirit grow
It's breaking out, and it's breaking free
Taking me to a new understanding
When I've landed in a world with branded
Identities of who you should be
Let me show you what we could see
Let me show you what we could be
Open your eyes, all three
Quiet your mind, let's dream
Eleven eleven, the time is right now in this moment
This moment, right here in this moment
Eleven eleven, the time is right now in this moment
This moment, right here in this moment
Yea, and I know you're tired of the fear
Open up your heart and bring all of your dreams here
Yeah, and I know you're tired of the lies
Open up your heart and speak your truth with one word, shivai
Open up your heart and speak your truth with one word, shivai
Yeah, and I know you're tired of the lies
Open up your heart and speak your truth
Yeah, eleven eleven
The time is right now in this moment
This moment
Right here in this moment
Eleven eleven
The time is right now in this moment
This moment
Right here in this moment
Discover and become yourself
Discover and become yourself, you're not here to be someone else
Discover and become yourself
