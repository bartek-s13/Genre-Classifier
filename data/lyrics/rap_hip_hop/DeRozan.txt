I ball in my city, DeRozan
I ball in my city, DeRozan
Everywhere I go they rolling

I ball in my city, DeRozan
Shooters they with me they rolling, aye, aye
Everywhere I go they rolling
They say we be on that bullshit, yuh, yuh
Bossing like Ricky DeRozan
And we be sipping on Rosé, aye, aye
I nike that bag nigga check me
Why do these niggas, they envy

How come these niggas, they envy
Get you some Borden's and Kenzie's
Come from a place where it's deadly
When it's time to go are you ready
Had to check out the city for money
Get three bands and I split it with mummy
Had to go and depend on a junky
Dodged the pen lotta times, I was lucky

The money running like the ocean
Ridin, ridin while we smoke it
This that deadmihana, niggas go to bed hopin
They gon wake up to a dollar
I gotta go when that money holler
Trap smelling real potent
Hope the neighbours don't call the police
Trap, trap get no sleep
21 with the high heat
Got my hitta that's J Swish
Lil bitch I mean J Neat

I ball in my city, DeRozan
Shooters they with me they rolling, aye, aye
Everywhere I go they rolling
They say we be on that bullshit, yuh, yuh
Bossing like Ricky DeRozan
And we be sipping on Rosé, aye, aye
And I keep that bag nigga check me
Why do these niggas, they envy

How come these niggas, they envy
Get you some Borden's and Kenzie's
Come from a place where it's deadly
When it's time to go are you ready
Had to check out the city for money
Get three bands and I split it with mummy
Had to go and depend on a junky
Dodged the pen lotta times, I was lucky

I was lucky
Woulda been caught up in fuckery
All cause a nigga is hungry
And all cause a nigga is starving
Get a bag, hit the stash, fuck a Sargent
I got the fire no arson
White boy, Chandler Parsons
Blue and red sirens I'm off of this
Got no time for an argument
Repair when they want a fix
Still on the town I be taking a risk
360 rotation, the wrist

I ball in my city, DeRozan
Shooters they with me they rolling, aye, aye
Everywhere I go they rolling
They say we be on that bullshit, yuh, yuh
Bossing like Ricky DeRozan
And we be sipping on Rosé, aye, aye

Get three bands and I split it with mummy
Had to go and depend on a junky
Dodged the pen lotta times, I was lucky

Come from a place where it's deadly
Used to come back with it empty
Like call up your guy
Like I need more shots
I paid hunned for twenty
I member them days where Truey's were Gucci and Nike Versace
Used to depend on the work like if it's out the country and how much it cost me
These niggas ain't sell no work
I sauce it up, Uzi Vert
My shoota he fresh off of jail
I sauce him up with a shirt
My life so precious nowadays
I sauce it up with a murse
In a Mclaren, MCM belt but reverse
Wassi on the chain with the first

I ball in my city, DeRozan
Shooters they with me they rolling, aye, aye
Everywhere I go they rolling
They say we be on that bullshit, yuh, yuh
Bossing like Ricky DeRozan
And we be sipping on Rosé, aye, aye
