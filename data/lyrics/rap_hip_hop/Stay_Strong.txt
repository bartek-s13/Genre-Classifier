We still stay strong

Fighting for all a we life
All a we choices no right, cah we no perfect
Every flaws and we no Christ
You can call it sacrifice
Man just waan see me mother nice
Gwaan go ask the kids dem inna the ghetto
If life is a fucking paradise
Man would a love a car fi drive
Yo, da shoes deh a no me size
A me bredda shoes a so we dweet, no watch the hype
'Cause we still haffi survive
JPS just cut the light off

Me future no right off
Life just a ask me fi show me mine

We still stay stro-o-ong

Man swear 'pon me life
Me never weak out when the rough days on
We still stay stro-o-ong
Still stay strong (yeah)
Me swear 'pon me life
Me never weak out when the rough days, ah yeah

Fi move me peeps out the ghetto, every youth fi rich
Another night without the food, dawg, me used to this
We a fight and we a lose but me no new to this
Mommy, when you couldn't find the money, me cool with this
Me swear to God me muss buy her a house with a pool with it
Jah, if You no busy give me few minutes
Protect me head but me gun haffi move with it
Cah when me born me never born with gold spoon
In it me friend dem gone and dem a say me grave dem soon dig it
More time we couldn't find lunch money
Dinner no sure when school finish
