Coded Language
Intro:
If I dumb it down, would they understand
I still don’t think they would, that’s why I speak in
Code, code, code
Every time I speak, it’s like they think it’s
Code, code, code
My lips don’t lie, they just don’t speak my
Code
Verse 1:
I am not like these people, they don’t understand me it’s like I am speaking in codes
How don’t they know that they don’t even know what it is that they don’t even know
I’m more Dr. Seuss than 2Pac it’s true but only God can judge me I know, I know
Truer than true, no one is you-er than you…ugly and broke
Honey I joke, homie we fucked, voting for Donald Trump watch it blow up
Mumble in rap and just watch it blow up but its only because, to sum it all up
The dumber it is than the more it get’s love, the bottom is humble but God they are dumb
I need some dopamine, I need to fuck, I need to comatose, I need some drugs
Acrylic responses to silicone feelings, I’m killing this content but still they don’t feel me
A milli in profits I still won’t be filthy of what am I guilty, oh?
Knowing what to say and when to say it so they only ever gotta play it with the real me though
They just want a language of the fake so I guess I’ll let ‘em take what they wanna take…
Really? No
Chorus:
They don’t know that they don’t know
They don’t know they don’t know
They don’t know that they don’t know
They don’t know they don’t know
They just want something to say
Fuck it man they just want something to say
No hoping and praying I’ve coded my language so fakes will just all go away…
Verse 2:
I don’t bend my standards, I flex my grammar
I don’t rep with a red hat talking MAGA or get with this trend rap talking Panda
Broads in Atlanta is not the mantra, Picking apart all this propaganda
Pocket a piece of the profit empower the bottom I brought ‘em up with this stanza
Watch my pursuit of a smarter consumer refusing this model that markets a stupid
Product to losers you’ve got me confused with somebody consumed with this popular movement
Hey, see no one says it but it’s so pathetic and not conducive
Sentiments embedded in the benjamins they only get on credit
Since then I’ve been poppin’ deuces
Yeah I’ve got something to say, I want some money and fame
Funny thing is if I copy paste or maybe copied Drake
Or recycled a rhyme from like ninety-eight
About rolling blunts they’d give us a plate
So we could eat some lunch with these fucking fakes…
Pump the base and just numb the pain while I stunt away all this dumb and plain
Chorus
Bridge:
(They don’t know that they don’t know…)
(Oh what’s the problem)
(Code Code Code Code Code, I speak in Code)
Oh what’s the problem with lowest and common
They say that the culture is gone and they lost it, nonsense…
They threw it away and complain about vultures assaulting their conscience
Fully aware I’m both humble and pompous
Don’t really care I should move to the tropics
Offshore my stack cause the syntax is wack
Fuck alternative facts while we all turn up on this and go…
Chorus
