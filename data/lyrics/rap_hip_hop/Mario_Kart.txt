Test Aitch like, what come again?
Tell a man rest up in the booth, key'd up, go ahh (Joke)
Me I do (Skrr), on the beat man come like Mario Kart (Vroom)
And how I'm rapping, I be lapping man with bars (Yep)
I'm ahead by far, you're gonna need a headstart

I step in the booth with class, I'm a maestro, flow too nice though
When I breeze past with a bitch with my hand on nitro
Dun kno I'm takin' her home she's a psycho (She's mad)
Yoshi best get back, lick off a turtle shell to his head back
Swerving lanes like a burning chase
But it's peak when I get some space and I draw for the jetpack (Boom)
Rags, tell 'em, sixteen for sixteen, back to back
They're still talkin' wass, are they daft? Shell 'em
Poisonous bars, I spit mad venom (Uh)
Yeah, track shellers, Rag, Shellers
Shower, bad weathers
I do skrrt on the beat like Mario Kart, I got mad tekkers

Blow pass man like vrooom
S-star with a mushroom
If I'm on it then it's a good tune
What I got day ones summer like June
So I may, light up your day
Or light up you if you get in my way
Southside, from where the shells go boom
Bounce on man, might send for the goons
And you can't get over Rags
I'm trap, man will get overlapped
Go over heads when I quote my raps
If it involves coins, I'm all over that
'Cause I work to get paid
And in this race I'm gettin' first place (Place)
And if a man tests, put shells in man chest like my birthplace

When I spray that bar
You man thought I was skrrting a whip
Might catch man in a Mario Kart
Flow on the track like I'm taking the piss
I'm-I'm back, it's the final lap
Man are gettin lapped, princess on my lap
Collect my coins, interest for the bank
Employ my boys, invest in the fam
Fuck a brake, accelerate non-stop
Stay first place and I'm on top
On top, first place
Aitch and I, that's high with wordplay
Play with words, nuff words get played with
Foot down, don't look at the MPH when it raises
'Cause the bar I raise
Aitch and I got bars for days
