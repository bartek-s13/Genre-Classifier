(Intro: Brandon Blackbeard)
I thought you were alive, I thought we were alike, I thought you were a life
(Chorus: Brandon Blackbeard)
Aint' got nowhere to go. Haunting all of the homes you know. Don't call it creeping, the door was open. Rolling the one night high, slowly came inside. The women had on, all on her lingerie. Waiting for me. Fought and fighting- SolangenJaying- Elevated. The bar we raising, the New Orlean Dome. All we know that the world we know aint the only one. Im having a go at time. EnPercent' this suit of mine pursued a rhyme. Party dont start when its black outside. Bouta' roll up, Im about to roll up, In a old school town. Making My round. An alarm in all them sounds. Making my round.
(Verse: Brandon Blackbeard)
Plot to the top, props what I got, Pops on my right, moms on my (Li)___Side. Raising a bright child, on the outside, they only see body only all the time. Mind out fishing just listen. Aight' ima' spark it. Digging that dagga. Haha. How high, did I, end beside'a, mastercard traveller. Teleport'er. Tella'- Porter. Singer-longer. Im going on an aeroplane, and I dont know if i'll be back again.
(Chorus: Brandon Blackbeard)
Aint' got nowhere to go. Haunting all of the homes you know. Don't call it creeping, the door was open. Rolling the one night high, slowly came inside. The women had on, all on her lingerie.
