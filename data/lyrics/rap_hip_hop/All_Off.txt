Take it all off
From here you don't fuck with anybody but us
And when you're called on
Just know that your secret's gonna stay here with us
Throwing ones in the air
Fucking we're sinning but we don't need a saviour
Throwing ones in the air
Falling in love through the lights and the paper
Take it all off
Take it, take it
Take it all off
Take it, take it

I kiss your self-esteem, you fuck my ego
My sins are hard to swallow, you repenting on a deep throat
Our solution is a blunt and some touching
And when we finished, we don't say nothing
Ohhh
Tell me what you wanna feel
Tell me what you wanna see
Tell me what the fuck is real
I gotcha baby, we’ll be what we wanna be
Ohhh
300 hundred other motherfuckers love you
But a couple hundred got me feeling you without a rubber
Ducking from the world
You can be the girl you wanna be
And never be my girl woah
Flashing lights illuminate you through the cash
The way you work it got me spending money fast

Take it all off
From here you don't fuck with anybody but us
And when you're called on
Just know that your secret's gonna stay here with us
Throwing ones in the air
Fucking we're sinning but we don't need a saviour
Throwing ones in the air
Falling in love through the lights and the paper
Take it all off
Take it, take it
Take it all off
