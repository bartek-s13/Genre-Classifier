<<<<<<< HEAD
(Chorus)
Living Like I'll Die Soon Cause The Lord Will Never Take Me
Saying That You Hate It, Homie, We Know That Is Fake, G
Forget The Guap 'Cause I Know You Don't Want To Play Me
Flexing All My Bling But Swear These Diamonds Never Made Me
Hangin' With My Squad And You Don't Want To Test Our Patience
They All Sick As Fuck And Medicine Will Never Change It
I Just Paid A Bill From All This Music While You Hating
So Say What You Want, But What You Saying Is I Made It
(Verse 1)
I Got Versace Alone
Do This Shit Right From My Home
You Better Sound The Alarm
Roof is On Fire, You Cannot Reach This
You In The Land of The Wrong
Chain Shining Brighter Than The Sun That's In The Sky, Woah
Everyone That Hate Me, Yeah I Know They Wonder Why, Woah
How This Kid Gon' Do This? Why Can I Not Ever Shine? Woah
You Weren't Making Moves So Homie It's Too Late To Whine. Woah
(Bridge)
Woah, Woah, What You Saying Is. (x4)
(Chorus)
Living Like I'll Die Soon Cause The Lord Will Never Take Me
Saying That You Hate It, Homie, We Know That Is Fake, G
Forget The Guap 'Cause I Know You Don't Want To Play Me
Flexing All My Bling But Swear These Diamonds Never Made Me
Hangin' With My Squad And You Don't Want To Test Our Patience
They All Sick As Fuck And Medicine Will Never Change It
I Just Paid A Bill From All This Music While You Hating
So Say What You Want, But What You Saying Is I Made It
(Verse 2)
If You Wanting A Reply Then I'll Be Breaking Yo Heart
Yo, I'm Taken, And I'm Loyal, I'm Just Doing My Part
My Shorty Got That Ass and You Know I'mma Stare
Hit it From The Back, And I'm Pulling Her Hair
(This Ain't, This Ain't)
This Ain't Bout No Fucking, I'mma Stay In My Lane
'Cause N*ggas Talking Bout The Guap But We Don't Even Know They Name
I'm Lil Fuego, I'm On Fire, and I'm Burning It Up
Make Some Smooth Up In The Studio I'm Churning It Up. Woah
(Bridge)
Woah, Woah, What You Saying Is. (x4)
(Chorus)
Living Like I'll Die Soon Cause The Lord Will Never Take Me
Saying That You Hate It, Homie, We Know That Is Fake, G
Forget The Guap 'Cause I Know You Don't Want To Play Me
Flexing All My Bling But Swear These Diamonds Never Made Me
Hangin' With My Squad And You Don't Want To Test Our Patience
They All Sick As Fuck And Medicine Will Never Change It
I Just Paid A Bill From All This Music While You Hating
So Say What You Want, But What You Saying Is I Made It
(Break Down)
Woah, Woah, Woah Woah Woah. (x4)
Diamonds on My Chain, and I Know That You Dig
Flexing on My Name, While You Talking That Shit
We All Know Ya Homies Fake, But We Rolling With It
I Got No Option, I'm A Monster, Got The Energy Lit. Woah
(Bridge Alt)
Woah, Woah, What You Saying Is...
"You Ain't Gonna Make It, You A Fake and I Lost My Respect."
Woah, Woah, What You Saying Is...
"Talk To Me, You Shaking, You Quit Breaking and We'll Talk Again!"
(Chorus)
Living Like I'll Die Soon Cause The Lord Will Never Take Me
Saying That You Hate It, Homie, We Know That Is Fake, G
Forget The Guap 'Cause I Know You Don't Want To Play Me
Flexing All My Bling But Swear These Diamonds Never Made Me
Hangin' With My Squad And You Don't Want To Test Our Patience
They All Sick As Fuck And Medicine Will Never Change It
