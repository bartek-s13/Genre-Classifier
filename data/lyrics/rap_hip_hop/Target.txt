(Ayy)
I don't know what they call it out here
This hatin' and talkin,' I guess that makes me a target
I see that they wanna judge me by what goes in my wallet
I ball like I'm Ben Wallace, I can't do a thing about it, oh

So they put me on the tag, yah (yah)
Definitely not gon trip, I got that bag, yah (yah)
Wonder why they treat me like the bad guy
You say I ain't the best, but that's a bad lie
I'ma do what I want, just leave me alone
If I don't do what you want, then you want me gone
I must say, you bein' real aggressive
The way you switch up on me real impressive (yah)
Ayy, I got mod up on my plate
You can see I'm doin' shows, so you think I'm out o' shape
Hate the fact that I won paid
All these people wanna trade
I'm the one they wanna hate
So to me, I'ma target
So they

Ayy
I think that I need a break
You know that I wanna stay
Some people just can't relate
Just look at my point of view
I don't have the time to waste
They wanna replace the Juice
And you know I beat the case, uh
You think if I sat out, I'd be sluggish
You think they won't pay me 'cause a drug test
Fun fact, I ain't never failed one, that's on me
You so worried 'bout the weed, what 'bout those PEDs
Got this platform, I'ma use it
Just 'cause I play ball don't mean I can't make music
If they hatin' at all
If they want me to fall
I'm a target
So they wanna go and
