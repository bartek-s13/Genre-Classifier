They tryna tell me that I'm somethin' that I can't be
This country shit is who I am, look how it made me
Now some of y'all prolly thinkin' that I'm crazy
Now let me tell you what I do on the daily
Mud ridin' in my pickup
Moonshine in my big cup
I got a wife I can't get rid of
Drinkin' Coors Light until I get the hiccups

Now just the other day, I was walkin' alone
Tryin' out my new boots with the rhinestones
I'ma country young fella, sellin' corn for a dollar
And if you get caught on my land, you'll get popped in your collar
Every man that's in my town wants me to marry his daughter
But Jenny's the only one, plus my uncle's her father
And she never comes outside unless I give her a holler
She's smokin' hot, I got the chills when I laid eyes on her
Out back in the barn, I got a horse name Mercedes
Sweetest thing you'll ever meet, but sometimes she can get crazy
Gave her a bath and cleaned her up, God damn, she looks so amazing
I combed her hair and led her on, I'm gon' be buckin' my baby, hey, hey
They tryna tell me that I'm somethin' that I can't be
This country shit is who I am, look how it made me
Now some of y'all prolly thinkin' that I'm crazy
Now let me tell you what I do on the daily
Mud ridin' in my pickup
Moonshine in my big cup
I got a wife I can't get rid of
Drinkin' Coors Light until I get the hiccups

Ay, brand new belt with the gold buckle on
My wife's like a rooster, gettin' her cock-a-doodle on
If you wanna buy some peas, you can meet me at the farm
We're country boys, wheat stalks is what I'm chewin' on
Revved up the tractor, I can hit another gear
Huntin' in the woods, I just dropped another deer
I got a little parched, so I drunk another bear
Then I chased it with some 'shine cause you know I like it pure
Me and Jimbo was sittin' at the barn
When some guy wanted trouble, so I had to give him part
He said somethin' 'bout my mom and it really made me hot
Cracked a bottle 'cross his head, cause the bastard went too far

They tryna tell me that I'm somethin' that I can't be
This country shit is who I am, look how it made me
Now some of y'all prolly thinkin' that I'm crazy
Now let me tell you what I do on the daily
Mud ridin' in my pickup
Moonshine in my big cup
I got a wife I can't get rid of
