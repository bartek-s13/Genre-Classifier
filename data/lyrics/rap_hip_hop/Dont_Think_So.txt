In the field, strapped up, can't relate though
Tryna take my chain, I don't think so
Do a hit, drive-by in the Range Rover
I'm a real nigga, lil nigga, if you ain't know
And you said it's on sight but you ain't blow
Tryna take my life but I ain't go
Broke nigga think he slicker than the lingo
Everywhere I go, nigga gotta keep a Draco, yeah yeah

Strapped up, if you running, get clapped up
Too close lil nigga, better back up
On Live, niggas change, you an actor
If your bitch want smoke, I'ma smack her
Dead folks, I ain't saying no names
Tryna throw shade, I ain't playing those games
All my real niggas ain't never gone change
In the field nigga, I don't fuck with no lame, nah nah
Homicide, mama crying, feeling that pain
Going OT, practicing on my aim
I ain't gon' lie, beef won't stop 'til the opp side die
JT gone, nigga, say bye bye
Niggas see me winning and they playing both sides
Like I stay strapped up so the opps don't slide
Niggas throw shade, tryna kill my vibe, nah nah
All I’m hearing is lies
I'm maturing, had to tuck my pride
Gotta grind, I ain't wasting no time
Bag so big, you don't see is you blind, nah nah
And your bitch call my phone, call me sexy
I'ma make her do the gang to impress me
Young nigga from the dirt jacking SB
Hit an opp, then the scene getting deadly, nah

In the field, strapped up, can't relate though
Tryna take my chain, I don't think so
Do a hit, drive-by in the Range Rover
I'm a real nigga, lil nigga, if you ain't know
And you said it's on sight but you ain't blow
Tryna take my life but I ain't go
Broke nigga think he slicker than the lingo
Everywhere I go, nigga gotta keep a Draco, yeah yeah

Gotta keep a Draco
Everybody in my city tryna hate, hate, hate
Gotta get these pesos
First bid I done backed up the Wraith, they can't relate
I'm going fast, they on they ass
Somebody tell 'em keep up with the pace
Homicide , they ain't fill up the safe
Tryna get this money, first place in the race, nah nah
I was down on my ass
Ducking from the East feds can't keep a tag
We don't give a fuck, we gon' go chase this bag
Homicide, mama crying, shit so sad, yeah yeah
They know they mad, we just go get this cash
It's just coming so fast, I can't be left in last

Losing myself, felt like this shit was a game
Felonies all on my name
I was too focused on drilling, not growing and building
So young, I was putting in pain
I done seen niggas get murked and a little bit worse
Can’t allow them to do me the same
You get hit where it hurt put your mans on a shirt
I ain't  but I'm going insane
Niggas ain't switching up, picking that glizzy up
Run up on me then that chopper gon' bang

And we'll probably hit him up, tell him to listen up
Up in the field I be doing my thing , yeah yeah
Shawty still give it up, I keep the Smith an' tucked
She give me top and I'm holding her brain
And I know they said bitches front, give 'em up
Lifestyle change, shit just can't be the same, nah nah
I was  with that chopper, gon' aim
Now I'm rapping, tryna follow my dream
And a lot of niggas tryna get in between
Kill a nigga then we skate off the scene
Came from nothing, you ain't part of the team
Interrogating, I don't know what you mean
Mama said I gotta grind to exceed
I'm distracted by some bitch on her knees

In the field, strapped up, can't relate though
Tryna take my chain, I don't think so
Do a hit, drive-by in the Range Rover
I'm a real nigga, lil nigga, if you ain't know
And you said it's on sight but you ain't blow
Tryna take my life but I ain't go
Broke nigga think he slicker than the lingo
Everywhere I go, nigga gotta keep a Draco, yeah yeah
