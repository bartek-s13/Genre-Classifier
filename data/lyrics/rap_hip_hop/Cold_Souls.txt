When you walked away at dawn
I heard your song
And now it's on my mind
Made a design on the right side of my heart
It may be wrong
But it wasn't black or white
Wondering when I look at your life if I caught you dead and numb
If you were only just a dreamer
If we were all night
When you were dead I took you by your head
When you were dead I took you by your head
What a wasted ode to hope
My heart is on the line
Staring at the time
And I gazed amazed
While a quiet storm was born inside your eyes
All dressed in black and white
Wondering when I look at your life if I caught you dead and numb
Thought you were only just a shadow
But you were all light
When you were dead I took you by your head
When you were dead I took you by your head
When you were dead I took you by your head
When you were dead I took you by your head
