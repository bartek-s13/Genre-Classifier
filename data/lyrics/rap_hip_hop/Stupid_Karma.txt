And I say caution, caution, caution stop recording
Everything that's coming out my mouth is not important
Why you so damn serious, I told you I was joking
I was only lost for the moment
So could you listen
Before you think everything could be fiction
And everything I say is a prediction
And I don't mean to be dissing
But it seem they only love when you missing
Why everything I touch is so addicting

Karma, stupid karma
We suppose to be in love but you give me drama
I don't mean to be this person with this rude persona
I just wanna live life and sip Arizona, Zona
I say karma, stupid karma
We suppose to be together but you give me drama
I don't mean to be this person with this rude persona
I just wanna live life and sip Arizona, Zona, aye

I could never get hired, I guess I'm just to fire
I wear my clothes wrinkled and plus, I like my food expired
One time I seen this men drop his wallet and then I stole it
I started running until I heard something scream Mr hold it
Hold it Mr and this exactly what I guessed it
I turn around I seen a cop he said sir your arrested
I was in the camera room and yeah I saw you steal
And now I'm thinking in my mind before I go to jail
Karma, stupid karma
We suppose to be together but you give me drama
I don't mean to be this person with this rude persona
I just wanna live life and sip Arizona, Zona
I say karma, stupid karma
We suppose to be in love but you give me drama
I don't mean to be this person with this rude persona
I just wanna live life and sip Arizona, Zona, aye

See me and this girl we been chilling dating for a while
She always tell me to grow up cause I act like a child
But I'll sacrifice so much just to see her smile
I know sometimes I'm never there but I still come round
Its like she scare to the point that she feels shes losing me
She always screaming and arguing and accusing me
She said forget your promises and all your last words
I swear to trust you if you give me all your passwords

Karma, stupid karma
We suppose to be in love but you give me drama
Why you gotta be this mean to be this person with this rude persona
I just wanna live life and sip Arizona, Zona
I say karma, stupid karma
We suppose to be together but you give me drama
I don't mean to be this person with this rude persona
I just wanna live life and sip Arizona, Zona, aye
