Changed my mind man..

Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough (Y'know?)
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow

Peace to Brentwood Town Shipping
I'm smoother than that Lex your whipping
With the rack and pinion
And Pirelli tires that be gripping
Sometimes I wonder if MCs really know
Mack's eternal bought to burn you
While in ten feet, of snow
I grab the mic and turn into Ali Baba
With just a dabber, my rhymes are guaranteed to grab ya
I got funk with the bass and soul
Cause I've been rockin' on the mic since nine years old
And I can groove with that, stupid fat
Rhymers when you're soupin' that
MCs catch a headache
And find where some Nuprins at
I'm on the case like Magnum P.I., F.B.I
Lookin for a man with the reason why
And it'll cost more than Lee Majors
To fix MCs after I kicks my flavor
Puff and Puff and blow the House down
Is what the Mack do whenever I get down
Gettin' down, boy (get down)
One two, Mack man's in full effect
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow

I'm like the greatest rapper, known to man
Got MCs meltin' in mouth and not inside my hand (c'mon)
And you can try to, write a rhyme-a
But the pace that I race'll have you lookin' like a old timer (old timer)
Do you wanna pay a visit, to rhyme exquisite (aheh)
That'll leave you standin' colder than a winter blizzard (AHH)
Mack's engaging, extra blazin'
Who's you phasing?
Power Rangers ain't more amazin' (amazin')
Rhyme flipper, flip-a-rhyme=a-ripper (uh-huh, say what)
Rip-a-rhyme-double-dipper while you talkin' on my zipper
I wanna know who's been naughty or nice
With the device, turnin' grown men into mice (yeah)
I can flip funk back and forth, forth and back
Ride more super rhymes against the track, tell 'em Mack (tell em)
I got Bad Boy as my back (that's right)
As we kick on the funk called MC subtract
Got flow for days, got rhymes to amaze (uh-huh, c'mon)
Got the brand new funk, here's the brand new craze, boy
Mack the dope (one two)
We break all of the funk on down (yeah)
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough (Mo Bee, make it..)
Gotta keep my flow (Bustin out, in the house)
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
(One two, as we get busier)
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough (We gon' get like this)
Gotta keep my flow

Come on everybody, let's all get down
Got rhymes by the ton while you weighs a pound (Whoo)
Supercalifragilistic type of hyper MC
That be me, twenty-twenty could not see (Can't see)
I don't feel the pressure, of an MC aggressor
That I got a rhyme for in my top dresser
(in your top dresser) Craig Mack, Bad Boy representin
Fat Funkster be gettin', for Fat Funk be hittin' (C'mon)
It's this man's turn to earn
Since my birth, a penny now is MC's worth (C'mon)
And MC's are nuttin' but a joke-a take a toke-a
Smoke fatter than the Ayatollah
Can't nuttin' ever stop the Craig Mack plans
To grab MCs, and crush em in my hands (as we get busier)
Like I said before, here comes the Mack
Power-packed in black, to make you see mad graphics
As we get busier (As we get busier)
In nine-four with the funk that hits on the floor
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough (rock on, rock on, rock on)
Gotta keep my flow
Gotta get the cash, gotta get the dough (rock on, rock on, rock on)
