When we were all too shy
I looked inside the paper note in my pocket
A handmade design, your note of hope aside
I watched your face crystalise as I dropped it
You'd know that I had read every word
You say you love
Or you want to say you need to tell me something
You didn't have to wait if you wanted to know my response

Two modern minds won't say what they want to
To push a button in real time

Would you answer a call when the hours are dark?
Knowing it was time to deliver a message?
I can't tell from the signs we're giving in our lines
Whittling our time, a symphony of vacancy
The wasted day is aging me
With nothing really to say

Two modern minds won't say what they want to
To push a button in real time, with an undo
Two modern minds won't say what they want to
To push a button in real time, with an undo
To push a button, rewrite lies with an undo

And I watch you write
You're still saying nothing
And I watch you write
You're still saying nothing
And I watch you write
You're still saying nothing
Then I watch you write
You're still saying nothing
Nothing at all

Two modern minds won't say what they want to
To push a button in real time, with an undo
Two modern minds won't say what they want to
To push a button in real time, with an undo
Two modern minds won't say what they want to
To push a button in real time, with an undo
Two modern minds won't say what they want to
To push a button in real time, with an undo
To push a button in real time, with an undo
To push a button in real time, with an undo
