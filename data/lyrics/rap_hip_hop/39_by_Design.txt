When you walked alone to leave your life at home
You really wanted to die
And if you hoped to hold the key to eternity
You really wanted to die
Can't count your blessings saying goodbye
Did you really watch your desires resign?
In the case of a wanderin' eye

When you fell to Earth and lost the love to love
You really wanted to try
Can't count your blessings saying goodbye

39, by design
Did they beam you up into the lights in the sky?
If you could take a Polaroid of your life
Would you cry?
Would you make them stare into the whites of your eyes
Eternal point of view

And when you came to turn the hands on the sands of time
You really wanted to die
And then you showed them all you fell
It was so hard to break the spell
You just wanted to die

Can't count your blessings saying goodbye

39, by design
Did they beam you up into the lights in the sky?
If you could take a Polaroid of your life
Would you cry?
Would you make them stare into the whites of your eyes
If you could take a Polaroid
39, by design
Did they beam you up into the lights in the sky?
If you could take a Polaroid of your life
Would you cry?
Would you make them stare into the whites of your eyes
Eternal point of view

Really just a roll of the dice
When truth or lies will make you cry
Really doesn't make a lot of sense
Too tense to recompense
Really just a roll of the dice
When truth or lies will make you cry
Really doesn't make a lot of sense
In the end we'll all be cleansed
