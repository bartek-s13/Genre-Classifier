Whenever I call you, baby, please look up at you phone
I don't want you feeling like I left you alone
I just needed some time, baby, I been out on my own
All these different bitches got me feeling too grown
But I’m feeling lone', lone', lone’, lonely
Without you over me
I just hope that you love me
So you can be with me, oh
I'm hesitant on giving love
So if you fuck it up
Accept the fact that you became a dub
I'm tryna do you right, but girl, it seem you did enough
If them other niggas better, baby, you could go with them
I ain't fighting with nobody for no position
It's plenty fish up in the sea and I'ma find other women
I'll probably end up doing better than you once I get missing
I see you hurting different hearts, oh girl, you up on a mission

I just need one chance, one chance to get you back
Show you how it is to hurt a heart like attacks
In every song I'm makin’, I gotta spit all the facts
You used to tell me write what I’m thinking up in my raps
So baby, tell me one more time how you feel about me
We could be taking first class flights overseas
There's a lock on my heart and, baby, I feel like you the key
Don’t you fuck up this privilege, baby, I'll get up and go leave
Know it's easy to leave you if you ain't keeping it equal
I need more than just attention, need my hands right beneath you
I’m going more than just a round, I'm tryna make it a sequel
And the way your pussy dripping, finna dive like a seagull
I know it hurts you, hurts you to see me doing better
I leveled up, it took some time to get my shit together
And thankfully we departed, I hope it stay forever
I'm 'bout to find another bitch that you gon' hate forever

I just need one chance, one chance to get you back
Show you how it is to hurt a heart like attacks
In every song I'm makin', I gotta spit all the facts
You used to tell me write what I'm thinking up in my raps
So baby, tell me one more time how you feel about me
We could be taking first class flights overseas
There's a lock on my heart and, baby, I feel like you the key
Don't you fuck up this privilege, baby, I'll get up and go leave
