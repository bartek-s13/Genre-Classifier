Scouse trappin' Tremz
I'm scouse trappin' Tremz
I pull up on a rat boy and let off the MAC-10
I pull up to my ex bitch like hel-hello again
I don't want that pum-pum
I send it on to my friend
Ay laah

Ket wigs in Liverpool
Are like dread-heads in Chicago
Got a sketty bum from Park Road
That has crack right in her asshole
She's on a train goin' outta town
To link little man with that parcel
Little man's on a anythin'
He's got gunners with him like Arsenal
On a quad or on a bike
'Bout to go and do dumb shit
Man-bag full of bullets
And they got the MAC on 'em
Better run kid
And anybody's ever done him wrong
They better run far lad
This is raw scouse, like raw buj
And I'll sell that to your ma' lad
And Bally Jones, I'll be ballied up
Three fifth for my double pump
Fifteen for my two fifty
I'll get it back when I hit the jump
You can go and ask K-O-D
About a rat man, he'll get bullied up
For the riches and fuck the rats
Thats Bigzy I'm tryna double up
In there more than ten toes deep
I ain't tryna squash no beef
On graft I've had no sleep
And if we get nicked lad we won't speak
It's our kid in his damn cap
But he's never been to the dam lad
He loves weed and motorbikes
For a new bike he'll go so ham
Scouse trappin' out the Lanny
Got hollow heads for this wammy
Got condoms for the gally
And I'll bang her in my bally
I got your main bird in my DMs
And that bitch is so scatty
I'll smoke your cousin
Like nothin' happened
Then walk away so happy
Scouse trappin' Tremz
I'm scouse trappin' Tremz
I pull up on a rat boy and let off the MAC-10
I pull up to my ex bitch like hel-hello again
I don't want that pum-pum
I send it on to my friend
Ay laah

Scouse trappin' Tremz
I'm scouse trappin' Tremz
I pull up on a rat boy and let off the MAC-10
For the riches and fuck the rats
Don't make me say it again
I'll doggy your sister
And make her brag about it to her friends
Ay laah

My teams full of winners
Your teams full of winnets
Bigzy had the man-bag
Like ay guess whats in it
Ay why'd you think you're the man
You can't dodge bullets, oh damn
Ay why'd you think you're the man
Ay bullet, bullet go bang
Scouse trappin' Tremz
I'm scouse trappin' Tremz
I pull up on my ex bitch like hel-hello again
For the riches and fuck the rats
Don't make me say it again
I got a bullet, I got a bullet
For your friend
Ay laah
My team's full of go getters
Your teams got no weapons
Our kid is a known shanker
Say a baptist, he's gonna wet ya
Broke boy, you're a broke boy
You've got no money, that's no cheddar
OT like little Cs, that's my bredda, that's my bredda
I-I-I don't think they want no war
'Cause all they seem to do is talk
Grab your bally load your John
Cast the rats and end 'em all
I'm FTR, I play no games
I cast the rats and end 'em all
FTR I play no games
Ay laah
From way back I've been bangin' out
It's always been my mission
Bigzy's still graftin'
And I ain't seen him for a minute
I'm a dark soul, you're an asshole
That's why you don't get no women
I've got long Johns full of hot ones
Hearin' Macaroni dishes (?)
From way back I've been a bad breed
And FTRs my mob
Young Tremz with the chubby belly I still ran from plod
I've never had no olders, all them older boys got robbed
And I swear they're gonna shoot me and all now I ain't been shot
(On my bike I'm leathered up
About to go and get dough)
They're like Tremz don't get 'em
But who got 'em, I don't know
But i bet we still get nicked though
And I bet they let us go
I bet we've all got alibis
('Cause i was with my bro)

Ay, scouse trappin'
You get me, FTR, scouse trappin' Tremz
Remember the name
Mob mobbidy
FTR
