R Hill Shit
Yeah, Yeah
When it’s all said and done
They’re gonna call me the GOAT bitch
Way Way too focused
Katana caressing your throat
Shit
Double edged made the beat too
Crossing many many many lines
Including two in her inner thighs
Speaking tongues, rolling eyes
I’mma kill it for the culture
This venomous flow like a cobra
All these mumbling Posers
Make em dinner for the vultures
You’re favoured rapper talking money and bitch
Or faking humility flaunting his riches
Or preaching on conscious decisions
Afta Hill is a money militia
Ay young rich and I’m handsome
Hard in the paint when I finish it’s and 1
Rapper they kneeling to label advances
Money phone broken they owning your asses
Brother is getting his mastered
While Afta is keeping his masters
48 laws, If you ask him
Look at my peers like what happened
This the R hill Mafia
A.K.A the waste yute mangamant
Or banishment bitch
I bounce heads on the canvas
And if we judging bars this flow is unanimous
Ah
Take em to the 16th with a 16
Risky, rather die than to miss a dreams
Missed me, these slit dreams make a wrist bleed
Bitch please I mix blood in my whiskey
Ay, Ay, Ay give em' twenty-four more
Give em 56 whole
Afta Afta Afta Afta Afta
Give em 56 bars then I...
(we gotta kill em' again)
I’m king poetic
This sedative flow better then medicine no
Better shit evident when I’m telling it
Last withdrawals made the teller quit
For the first time I made her count then lick
My pen game put em on skates
Whole rink on my neckless, capital punishment if you test me
Big C pimpin, gotta call a boy HOV-echkin
No exit
Spitting fire hazards
Dope man with the herbal essence
Oh damn licked more times than a post stamp
No co sign, haram gang, I go ham
Hear the haters like a blown amp
Nothing left to gain, no peak
I’m choke you out both hands and
I’ll give you something to kiss
This Dick
Hyperbolic, bitch I'm on an Island
Everybody sitting super silent, when I'm super saiyan, when I'm spitting knowledge
If you want it I could kill a dollar on my most wanted
On my Angelina or my Morgan Freeman, bitch I mean it
Kung-Fu Kenny Level
Face on the penny level
Icon on a Remy level
God on a demi level
