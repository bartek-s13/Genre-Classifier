Aiyyo it's DJ KaySlay the Drama King

And for those of y'all that didn't finish school
Check this out, it's all good
I'mma run y'all through this little Thug-acation right now
And what we gon' do, is we gon' scream out the letters in the alphabet
And every letter you hear screamed out, from A to Z
My man Papoose gon' break it down for you
So what you do, is get your pens, your pads, and take notes
Yo, Papoose, let's go
