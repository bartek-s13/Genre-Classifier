(Verse 1)
I get it now, I can see where I need to be
Nobody else here needs to make that clear to me
I'm here to breath, stop trying to take my air away
I'll be at the top but I'm not there today
So I can only grind and hope somebody notices
The effort that I go through just to keep all my focuses
And then to record them on the beat
When nobody even knows me or who I am
Where I stand and where I'm coming from
It's just another song sitting inside the universe
Sound waves breaking away and off into the verse
As I disperse and turn the world a little further
Every word that I spit is just a reaction to actions
And actuality is actually just in our anatomy
Brain powers our thought's so we make ourselves scared
The monsters are in ourselves and never under the bed
(Hook)
Sometimes I wonder If I should end it all
Should I end it all? Should I end it all?
Does this life I'm livin really end at all?
Does it end at all? Does it end at all?
Times like this make me think I'm meant to fall
Am I meant to fall? Is this a mental fall?
Sometimes I feel like I'm just gone
Yeah I know I'm gone, I'm gone
(Verse 2)
I guess the questions where never really answered
The necromancers scarin me back to my parent's
Real life is coming to get us and damn I'm not ready for it
I'm already dead inside and the dead of night is coming
I'm running and running away from fears
Shit I'm never looking back cos I can't face what I did
Sitting there with my face in my hands
A page and a pen, all I ever needed to erase what I did
The paradox of nature takin off all the accidents
Everything matters cos It's all just a happening
And my imagining can't fathem the chance that
Maybe this world isn't crazy but just a little awkward
With a little tilt maybe it's just a little off then?
Twisting on an angle like a spinnin top
Will it ever fall? Will I ever fall (I hope I fall)
Sometimes I wonder if maybe I should just end it all
(Hook X2)
Sometimes I wonder If I should end it all
Should I end it all? Should I end it all?
Does this life I'm livin really end at all?
Does it end at all? Does it end at all?
Times like this make me think I'm meant to fall
Am I meant to fall? Is this a mental fall?
Sometimes I feel like I'm just gone
Yeah I know I'm gone, I'm gone
(Verse 3)
But that's an endless wrong and I can't end on a bad note
I'm just trynna spread love through my anecdotes
But I just panic and keep on rapping bout my depression
Every lesson I'm giving's just a hidden message
To find the answer you need to look inside yourself
But there's no need for me to look cos I guess time will tell
Is it all fate inside this hell that I'm living in?
I wonder if it would be wrong to start giving in
Such a conundrum for such a young man
I have such a big chance and so little room to fuck up
There isn't much assistance for a dude trying to erupt
I think I've reached my boiling point so where do I go now?
I'm so sour over the fact that you don't know how
Much fucking time I put into my own sounds
I'm sick of this old house I'm living in and all this troubled music
