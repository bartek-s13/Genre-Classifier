I just wanna go far away, far away, far away, far away with you, baby
Baby, what I'm tryna say, tryna say, I don't want nobody, just me and you, baby
But you don't wanna listen, you just think I'm out sleepin' with other bitches
Yeah, you trippin', I'm the one that got you livin' how you livin'
I hurt your feelings and I'm sorry for that
But when you fell out of love, it be hard to go back
And yes I got a soft side, but it be hard to show that
We done broke up so many times but don't nobody know that
'Cause Instagram pictures got 'em thinkin' we together
And I can't own up to my wrongs 'cause I'm just tryna make it better
But I just wanna go far away, far away, far away, far away with you, baby
Baby, what I'm tryna say, tryna say, I don't want nobody, just me and you, baby

We used to fuck for hours, on the bed and the shower
Everything was all ours, that's when she just turned sour
I feel like I watched you grow from a seed to a flower
And there's shit you wanna know but I can't even tell you 'bout it
You won't never find another nigga like me, I doubt it
And you know that I don't mean what I say, stop poutin'
I was outside lookin' for love and I found it but I lost it
Now with my heart, I'm so cautious

But I just wanna go far away, far away, far away, far away with you, baby
Baby, what I'm tryna say, tryna say, I don't want nobody, just me and you, baby
But you don't wanna listen, you just think I'm out sleepin' with other bitches
Bae, you trippin', I'm the one that got you livin' how you livin'
I hurt your feelings, girl, get out your motherfuckin' feelings
You make a nigga wanna have no dealings
Far away, far away, far away, far away with you, baby
Baby, what I'm tryna say, tryna say, I don't want nobody, just me and you, baby
