Ay, she say she fucked a nigga to my song, yeah
Was tryna get it on me
Catch that feeling
What it feel like?
I said pull up on me darl' I'll fuck your brains out
Matter of fact I'll pick you up like I'm your man now

You play my shit in the ride, thoughtful
Starin' in your eyes, I like... you
It's always better when I'm high, got dro
Rubbin' on your thighs, I like... you

Ay, ain't none of your friends business
Ain't none of your friends business what we do (we do)
And, ain't none of your mans business
Ain't none of my girls business what we do (we do)
I like you... (I like, I like, I like, I like, I like you), yeah
Ay baby I like you (I like, I like, I like, I like, I like you)

Ay, doin' 35 in a 85
Tryna see what's up with the 6-9
(Doin' 35 in a 85, tryna see what's up with the 6-9)
Ay, ay, have you ever met a nigga like-
Me you know I hit it right, all the time (all the time)
You play my shit in the ride, thoughtful

It's always better when I'm high, got dro
Rubbin' on your thighs, I like... you

Pull up real smooth in the two-door
You can have the world if you want
So you wanna be my girl or you don't?
That come with repercussions
Real discussions, think you're bluffin'
Put your money where your mouth is
Tryna put you on some real shit
You love him so much but you steppin' outside to text (yeah)
It’s funny ‘cause I know I'm next and he really your ex (ay, yeah)
That's me, jumpin' out the window
I got, way more shit to live for
Baby out here hidin' shit
Don't be out here fuckin' up the vibe and shit
I know you like this shit, yeah
Ay, ain't none of your friends business
Ain't none of your friends business what we do (we do)
And, ain't none of your mans business
Ain't none of my girls business what we do (we do)

(I like, I like, I like, I like, I like you)
