I'm gonna lose this game
I've got no poker face
I'm not designed for this, this, this
If I could speak in code
I wouldn't be so bold
I can't control my lips, lips, lips
I've never been so alone
I tend to be too loud but
I'm not ashamed of my words

Clearly I'm gone and I'm going
Into the deep end
Far over my head
It's so unfair
I'm gone and its showing
All over my skin
Everyone knows gone and it shows
But I don't care
How do you make me smile
Simply by telling the time
You got the zealous eyes, eyes
I, I could just stare all day, lay there and melt away
I'm such a helpless case, case, case
I've done away with my pride
They say I'm out of my mind
Can't even say it's a lie

Clearly I'm gone and I'm going
Into the deep end
Far over my head
It's so unfair
I'm gone and it's showing
All over my skin
Everyone knows gone and it shows
But I don't care

Going, going, going, going
Into the deep end, into the deep end
Going, going, going, going
Far

Clearly I'm gone and I'm going
Into the deep end
Far over my head
It's so unfair
I'm gone and it's showing
All over my skin
Everyone knows gone and it shows
But I don't care
Deep end...my head...
