On a Warm San Franciscan Night
On a warm San Franciscan

Knight
Lord Radio and Hale Bop on the Bay Bridge faded
Trying to find Smiley's house, thank God we made it
Yo, blunts, broads and beats, keep it low through the streets
And niggas givin' us pounds cause of these dope-ass sounds
We run aground like ships, over these beats I flip
The bass is hittin' so hard that your CD skips
Well check it out, make sure it doesn't happen again
I got my grip on it, so turn it up to volume ten
Volume 10, word, like that brother from L.A
Lord Radio and Hale Bop mean streakin' through the Bay
We all-city like the Mayor, you see my name
On more fresh shit than Creed Taylor
The G for international ladies like a sailor
Like a sailor I get drunk and bust flows to the beat
Like my man J, I feel the Agony in Defeat
Cause sucka-chumps wanna test and step like we don't know
We doin', we doin' shows in San Francisco
That's right young writer, got a hit for all you biters
Time to bless another track we getting rid of the whack
We put em in the back with the other Tappan Zee shit
Beats hit hard, make the trolly do ollie
Old folks grabs their collies and vacate the Bay
See a name in Northern Lights, Thes Love and Double K
We getting wild for the night, we getting wild for the night
And it all went down, what, what
On A Warm San Franciscan Night
Yo, rocking shows for you and your crew
On A Warm San Franciscan Night
We rollin' blunts and doin' the do
On A Warm San Franciscan Night
We doin shows with a mic check a one two
On A Warm San Franciscan Night
P.U.T.S is on a bad foot coming through
On A Warm San Franciscan Night

We was drinking, smoking, more smoking, more drinking
Didn't think about the morning hangover, just didn't want to be sober
Yo Radio, tell me how did you feel
Like I'll never catch a DUI, hit gas
Peel, make a left on Market, yo Mister Double K
Ay, ay what's up
Roll up the windows and spark it
Done deal, yo, you didn't have to ask twice
Just park on the top of the hill, so we can peep the city lights
I'm on award tour, we got it locked like Alcatraz
Doin the San Francisco show like Hubert Laws
CTI 7071 go buy it
Bring the drums like Harvey Mason don't try it
Better look next time, trying step the P
You in the Bay, punk, I guess you ain't heard about L.A
Yo Double K, tell 'em that the P's unique with the beats
P.U.T.S shows, a San Francisco treats
A San Francisco treat just like some Rice-A-Roni
Put it in your mouth and let it run down the middle just like Monie
Phony homey, you never rock a party
Your whack-ass crew gets called out
See I play the rod-roddy come on down
To the south-land punks, smell' the concrete
Have you askin' questions from ya' head to your feet
You don't want none of this shit that I'm offering
Sayin that the P can't rock your city, (what)
Fool you measure for a coffin
Very often we win, yo, very seldom we lose
Spice rockin' there mother-fuckin whole city
On A Warm San Franciscan Night
Yo, rollin' blunts and doin the do (the do, the do)
On A Warm San Franciscan Night
Chillin' with your girl and her crew (her crew, her crew)
On A Warm San Franciscan Night
Scaring old people, still doin' the do (we're doin' the do)
Yeah, making collect calls into another area code, we mowed
We be the P.U.T, 310, we be the main extension I be the Double K
And we crowning, downing, 40 ounces, vodka, whatever, juice, ludes
San Francisco here we come, we're coming back we gonna have a gun
Pow, pow ,pow ,pow
Much love to the Bay Area
P-U-T-S
