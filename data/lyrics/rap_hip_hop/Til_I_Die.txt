Til the day I die, Ima be alright
Ima be just fine, but when I lie
Ima see that fire, Ima give up mine
Never switch up sides, I made my mind (Ooh)
Now this my time (Ooh)
I’ll be just fine (Ooh)
Until I die

And she started to cry, I said oh no
Everything is alright, this what I chose
Sorry that I been dry, no time for a hoe
I don’t care to reply, yeah I’m layin too low
Soft, she says I’m not
Sweetie, I can’t stop
See me, I’m so lost
Vvs, what’s it cost
You weren’t even into me 'til I got me some drip in me
See you as an enemy get up out my vicinity
Soon I start to make it they’ll say I’m from a facility
I get too damn faded I hope this don’t end up killing me
Til the day I die, Ima be alright
Ima be just fine, but when I lie
Ima see that fire, Ima give up mine
Never switch up sides
 x2
Til the day I die, Ima be alright
Ima be just fine, but when I lie
Ima see that fire, Ima give up mine
Never switch up sides, I made my mind (Ooh)
Now this my time (Ooh)
I’ll be just fine (Ooh)
Until I die
