Verse 1
Tell me where to go when the soul ain't got no where to go
Sometimes it be cold
But you know just what i'm headed for
Oh its so incredible
Feeling this high away.....
(yea oo na na)
Just, tell me what's the reason for the change
I don't wanna give up on any other way
(they'll tell you that}
Everywhere you go there's gon' be some things that put you low
As long as you know
As long as you
Chorus 1
Take me up until I feel the high x2

Don't wanna go and lose myself
As long as you know
As long as you
Take me up until I feel the high x2
I don't wanna come down
Dont wanna go and lose myself
Verse 2
Oh, I've got the rhythm and bass
Yeah there's no need for the money or fame
(or the fame now)
Take me apart from the fake
On the real, let's get this done for real
(lets go)
Now this has been a coaster ride
Its terrifying
Trying to find my way in this world
It's best that you know, that
This is what I do now
As long as you know
As long as you
Chorus 2
Take me up until I feel the high x2

Take me up until I feel the high x2
I don't wanna come down
Don't wanna go and lose myself

Take me up until I feel the high x2
I don't wanna come down
Don't wanna go and lose myself
As long as you know
As long as you

I don't wanna come down
Dont' wanna go and lose myself
