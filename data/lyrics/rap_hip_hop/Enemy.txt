It's a holiday, open this bitch, woop-woop-woop

I don't think I love you anymore now
I don't think I want you anymore now
Baby, you should go and find someone else
Said, I don't think I love you anymore now
Woah, woah
Woah, woah (Skrrt)
I don't think I love you anymore now
I don't think I want you anymore now (Yeah)

She hit up my phone, I ain't text back (Text back)
She hit my DM, that's a big trap (Big trap)
Said she missing me, yeah, I know that (I know that)
When she hear this song, she'll be so mad (Yeah)
Every day, I got my phone on Do Not Disturb (Woah)
Never ran into someone annoying like her (No)
Had to cut her off, so I threw her in the dirt (Damn)
She may think I'm sad, but I left with a smirk (Skrrt)

I don't think I love you anymore now
I don't think I want you anymore now

Said, I don't think I love you anymore now
Woah, woah
Woah, woah (Skrrt)
I don't think I love you anymore now
I don't think I want you anymore now (Yeah)

I got a hitman, I got a hitman, his name is Depression
Killed all my feelings, killed my emotions, so now I am careless
Baby girl, do not go ludicrous, and she so bad, need a crucifix
I got a hundred right on my wrist, livin' this life, getting used to this
No, I do not want you no more, baby girl, you deserve more
Kick her ass right out the door, broken heart right to the core
I don't wanna talk to you so leave me alone
You got a new man every day, you a ho

I don't think I love you anymore now
I don't think I want you anymore now
Baby, you should go and find someone else
Said, I don't think I love you anymore now
Woah, woah
Woah, woah (Skrrt)
I don't think I love you anymore now
I don't think I want you anymore now (Yeah)
