Ohhh, ohh, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea
Ohhh, oh, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea

I, I can do all things/
Through Christ who strengthens me/
Through Christ who strengthens me, yea/
'Cause I got faith, yea. That's all I really need/
'Cause I got faith, that's all I'll ever need/

Faith is the substance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things unseen/
But I understand that you cannot comprehend how I can put faith in something I cannot see/
But think about it, you breath in you breath out, that's air it's no doubt/
In and out of your mouth you can't see it/
I trust what He say, He's not in the grave/
Rose on the third day, best believe it/
And it might take some time for you to change your mind/
You might be on your death bed, might be on your last leg/
And you will ask the question, how did I get here/
Where am I goin' when my heart stops/
But you should figure that out way before then/
'Cause time is your enemy, and death is his friend/
And you could live your best life, right here right now/
Fall into the arms of your Father and He'll show you how/

I, I can do all things/
Through Christ who strengthens me/
Through Christ who strengthens me, yea/
'Cause I got faith, yea. That's all I really need/
'Cause I got faith, that's all I'll ever need/

Can you imagine what it must have felt like to walk in the desert for forty years, only on faith/
Or what about this, if you stepped out that boat, would you sink to the bottom of your early grave/
Or would you say, Jesus I see you, I'm coming, I'm not gonna' look at the waves/
They're crashing around me, they all want to drown me but no, not today/
Everything that lead to this moment right here and right now, is His plan/
Why would I doubt Him, and why would I cry when I know that my life is in His hands/
So I will stand, I will not falter, and I won't be moved/
I'm not the first man to walk in these shoes/
I'm not the first man to walk down this road/
Lord I know that You know that I know that/

I, I can do all things/
Through Christ who strengthens me/
Through Christ who strengthens me, yea/
'Cause I got faith, yea. That's all I really need/
'Cause I got faith, that's all I'll ever need/

Conscience
Nothing's new under the sun/
Depending what son you live under, you could be the one/
That taps into a potential you can't attain pulling on coat tails/
What you could get for wholesale anyway, on the contraire/
Momentum swings, like special teams when the King's faith is in the spot/
Gives a peasant the audacity to dethrone what you watch/
Sir Robin of Locksley warrior of luxury/
With a lunch kit of fish and loaves. Trying to feed the whole country/
Faith/
