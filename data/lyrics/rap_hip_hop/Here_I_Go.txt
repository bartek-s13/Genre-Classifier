All these dumb ass bitches, I'm having a blast right now
Yeah

I heard you bitches was looking for me (Bitch, here I go)
I heard you bitches was looking for me (Bitch, here I go)
I heard you bitches was looking for me (Bitch, here I go), bitch
I heard you bitches was looking for me

If you looking for a nigga, I'll drop a pin right now
I'll fuck you and all your best friends up right now
And if I'm OT, then trust me, when I touch back down
I'm with whatever, best believe ain't been no ho in me ever
And if you fuck up this designer, I'ma fuck you up better
Little ho can't keep her mouth closed, keep thinking she clever
Y'all ain't Dolls, y'all knockoffs
New whip with my top off
Bitch, you just a jump off
Biting my shit, jump off
Y'all bitches going bald while I ball out
It's only room for one Doll inside the doll house
Flow so motherfucking sick that I should call off
The followers on IG ain't what I call clout
You bum broke broads, I should probably call out
But no names for lames, they know who I'm talking 'bout
Since you aggy, bitch, send your addy, bitch
Little aggy bitch, I'm a big Doll
Fuck all that catty shit, I'm a savage, bitch
Fuck all that sneak dissing, better at me, bitch

That bitch right here
That bitch right here
That bitch right here
That bitch right here
