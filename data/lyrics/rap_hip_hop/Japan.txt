Outside on smoke, outside on violence, samurais on the glide, yeah we're violent
Pull up, pause, hop out and knife him, drench man more than once, I'm too violent
Violent man with a violent shank, saw my long sword and he ran
Outside with Bankai or Zabuza, turn mans white tee Japan

Got man on ropes like Mysterio, run a man down with my rambo
Dip man up in his mango, love seeing blood spill, man's a demon
Yutes getting involved for no reason, them man guilty of treason
Dip, splash, get him down quickly, chinged my man, I splashed up his friend
Heard them man over there want me dead, like c'mon mate, don't get me stressed
Never lack, I keep it deck, ching splash, I'm aiming for necks
Tried to get six, but nigga only got 2, ST with da broom, aiming at you
Don't act stupid, don't move confused, beat man down like I know kung fu
Verbal verbal talk on the net, them man ain't letting it bang
They're shooting blanks, stupid gems, man pull up on the K like "What, who's screaming Mead?"
Get bored in the head, ain't got no time for games (Shh!)
Come through and blow mans chest, long sami' on me, this shit come big
Looking like CTP, man Venomous Bop with gang
She love the shoulder, she loving the lean, gang crash like Bandicoot
Hop out of the car like Peek-a-boo! One fuck up, hold a stab wound
No one's dying, fuck a Juju, like no one's dying, fuck a Juju

Outside on smoke, outside on violence, samurais on the glide, yeah we're violent

Can't mention me 'cause I'll splash ya, bore mans brain, I'll bore up mans hat
Opps chat shit but they lie in their tracks, how you gon' hit the booth just like that?
Run up on me, there's no running back, little dumb fags, stop the chat-chat
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe ,snatch mans brain, take it, back it home
Ching splash holes in cornrows, do 'em and dash, crash for my bros
Catch a opp, do him up clean, man don't pause, I ching man then I skeet
Three man deep like Ed, Edd 'n' Eddy, catch a opp, man slap him on telly
Loosescrews doing Kung-Fu, catch a opp boy, man go Ku
Ching splash, I'm crashing at yout's, stop that hype, I'll pull up on you
Please don't run, just come hold a few, fucking cowards, moving brand new
Lost their form like Fernando Torres, watch man dash and blow out like Sonic
Lost their form like Fernando Torres, watch man dash and blow out like Sonic
