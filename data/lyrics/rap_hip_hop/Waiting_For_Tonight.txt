It's been so long

Waiting for tonight
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight
I’ve dreamed of this for so long
Waiting for tonight (Oh-oooh)
I'm waiting for tonight (Oh-oooh)
I'm waiting for tonight

I wanna take you where it’s always nice out
Turn the lights out and knock her lights out
Turn her insides, inside out
All I wanna do is catch a flight now
No sleep, I've been up all night
I'm not tripping as long as the mood's right
She thinks I'm with a different girl as soon as my phone dies
I know the devil's real, yeah, I've seen her with my own eyes
I won't let the money and the fame, make me
I won’t let the bullshit or pain, break me
I’m doing alright, I can't complain lately
I know I’m on the right path when everybody's hating

Oh I had to hold on
No I had to hold on
Oh I had to hold on

Waiting for tonight
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight
I've dreamed of this for so long
Waiting for tonight (Oh-oooh)
I'm waiting for tonight (Oh-oooh)
I’m waiting for tonight

And I know she gon' change me
Feel like nothing's right lately
But my life's so gold
Wanna stunt, AP, yeah I'm feeling myself
Cut the lights down low
Need a light, get stoned
Get me in my zone
Move quick, too smooth, yeah, layup
Time and time, I'ma tell you how I feel
Just 'cause I feel some way
But you know, 'cause I tell you everyday
You are my sunshine

Oh I had to hold on
No I had to hold on
Oh I had to hold on

Waiting for tonight
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight
I've dreamed of this for so long
Waiting for tonight (Oh-oooh)
I'm waiting for tonight (Oh-oooh)
I'm waiting for tonight

I'm waiting for tonight
