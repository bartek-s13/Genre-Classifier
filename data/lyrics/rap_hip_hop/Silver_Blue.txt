Silver Blue
Said goodbye to no one
She thought it through
And left me standing in the road
If you were ever lonely
You never let it show
But someday baby you'll be here
And I'll be going home without you
And blood on both my hands
'Cause I took you through
And now we're both too weak to stand
You think you're gonna live forever
And somehow find me there
But you'll be wearing golden wings
And fall right through the air
Silver Blue
Wanting you
I've been a fool for trying
'Cause I get so blue
That I don't know if I'm crying
If you are ever lonely
And you let me know
I'll come running right on time
And rock you gently home
Silver Blue
