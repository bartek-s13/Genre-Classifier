From the L to the O and the V to the E
The L... the O... and the V... the E
Love... love... love

The words love and like both have four letters
But they’re two different things altogether
'Cause I've liked many ladies in my day
But just like the wind they've all blown away
See to love someone is an atmosphere
That you both still share when one's not there
There's no real way it can be explained
I guess it's the way I smile when I hear your name
It's the little things you do that mean so much
It's the care that you put into every touch
It's the way I trust you, and you trust me
I guess some of us are so lucky

I was known for having the upper hand
I was known as a stone cold ladies' man
If it wasn't for you, I'd be that way still
But lately there's a change in Jalil
Though my friends play games, and tease me a lot
I know I'm more than happy with what I got
When I get up in the morning, and go to work
See all day long I stay alert
Until we come home at night, and close the doors
Two people sharing one common cause
When I say one love, you can trust me
'Cause never have I been so lucky
One love, one love
You're lucky just to have just one love
One love, one love
You're lucky just to have just one
One love, one love
You're lucky just to have just one love
One love, one love
You're lucky just to have just one
One love, one love
You're lucky just to have just one love

Now the love I used to have just left me cold
I used to buy her everything from diamonds to gold
At first I thought she'd left me 'cause I didn't buy her enough
But then she left me a note along with all my stuff
Said "Maybe one of these days you'll have to learn
That love is something that you gotta earn
And once you earn it gotta know how to keep it
You got to want it as well as you need it"
To have lost love was a hurtin' lesson
But to have had love was a definite blessing
And I know what the Beatles were thinking of
When they said that money can't buy me love
When you say lost love, what do you mean?
I just went through the exact same thing
Mind was lost for a whole different reason
I lost my love because of cheatin'
Started goin' through the streets all day and night
I guess greedy best describes such an appetite
I wish I had her back, but it remains a wish
I guess a bird in the hand beats two in the bush
I'd like to thank you girl for teaching me love
Because all in all I had a ball
Guess it's better to have loved and to have lost
Then to never have loved at all

One love, one love
You're lucky just to have just one love
One love, one love
You're lucky just to have just one
One love, one love
You're lucky just to have just one love
One love, one love
You're lucky just to have just one
One love, one love
You're lucky just to have just one love
Now I think it's 'bout time that we break it down
This is all about the love that we lost and found
About the love that we missed, and the love we shared
About the love that just up and disappeared
About who's was for real and who was fake
So you can learn from our mistakes

'Cause it was already written, done and said
So you can stay two steps ahead
The L is for the love which you give
The O is for the one who we live
And the V is for the vibrant letter
The E means may we last forever

One love, one love
You're lucky just to have just one love
One love, one love
You're lucky just to have just one
One love, one love
You're lucky just to have just one love
One love, one love
You're lucky just to have just one
One love, one love
You're lucky just to have just one love
One love, one love
You're lucky just to have just one love
One love, one love
You're lucky just to have just one
One love, one love
You're lucky just to have just one love
One love, one love
