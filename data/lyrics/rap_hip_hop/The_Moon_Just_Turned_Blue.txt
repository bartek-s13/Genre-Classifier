Hang up the phone, and lose my number
Leave me alone so I can cry
Don't touch my heart anymore
It's broken and sore
And the moon just turned blue
Goodbye, goodbye
Go back to town with your old boyfriend
He'll take you home
And I know why, that it's only fair I guess
And my heart won't die from this
But the moon just turned blue
Goodbye, goodbye
Little darlin' the moon just turned blue
I was lookin' right at you
Lookin' sweet lookin' baby blue
And shy, oh Lord
I got to thinking, maybe such a fancy lady
Might be tellin' mighty fancy lies
Oh you can count me out of your triangle
I'm number three I'm too late to lie
And I don't need heartache at all
I can't stand the fall
And the moon just turned blue
Goodbye, goodbye
Little darlin' the moon just turned blue
