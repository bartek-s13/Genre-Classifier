L.B.B

Filled with greatness a young Cash Clay
But butts and roaches all in in my astray
Crush and broke get it the fast way
Slow money better than dope money
Ran from dope boys pop owed money
Why they tryna take this hope from me
I turnt the other cheek
They tried to take my coat from me
Started banging B's
Bet I get you smoked money
Started slanging tree's for that smoke money
Now I'm high off my own supply
Bumming it
How am I suppose to fly?
My wings clipped
At the birth of a kingship
Y'all should bring gifts
A wiseman told me let your ink spit
Put your blade down
You paid!
Witg a currency that ain't on Pay Pal
Never been around the world
I just took a greyhound
Feeling like a outcast
Never been to Atown
Well that's Dre town
Use to weigh pounds
Got grace now
Cuz they'll eat you food
So you stay down or you lay down
Cops pat you from the waste down
And leave you facedown
In that piss and dog s***
Tell me how it taste clown?
Rednose and a trey pound
Moving bricks and that dog food
You got a case now
Upstate how
Your momma rent gone get paid?
Payless on shorty feet can't get those Jay's
Cornrolls on his dome can't afford those waves
O.G. Kush the only time he get good grades
Forget a 9 to 5
He down to ride
Cuz crime pays
Sundays wit Grandmoms so he know God saves
Ran thru a couple joints & he don't got aids
That's a miracle
He spiritual
Plus the boy is lyrical
He know it's more than girls
And it's more than just a night
See he was bought up at a price
So it's more to this life
Little Black Boy

Where are you going?
Don't you know your chosen?
Pick by the All Knowing
But you just keep on
Rolling Rolling Rolling
Ya keep on Rolling, Rolling, Rolling (Repeat 2X)
In a car that's stolen
Police patrolling
Where are you going
Little Black Boy?
(Little Black Boy)
Where are you going
Little Black Boy?
End
