<<<<<<< HEAD
I’m cooler than your brother
Big bag of marijuana
Just bought a bag of reefer
Hope I do not see my momma
She tells me I’m crazy
I tell her I’m sorry
Next time I won't pick up her Facetime inside the party
If you wanna see me fucked up
Just ask someone from college
I increased my knowledge
But I do not recall it
10 G’s on me from crypto
In the penthouse kitchen
I made lots of money
But I still do all my dishes
Bitch no I’m not famous
Bad hair when it’s raining
Just pulled up to 30th to meet you at the station
I'm driving in the Tesla, yes you sit adjacent
Shout goes to Elon my dude know how to just blaze it
I’m driving fast
I'm driving fast in the whip
I’m driving fast
I'm driving fast in the whip

Pop another molly‚ and thought I didn't feel it
Now I’m at the party and the floor look like the ceiling
But do not call my mama‚ cuz I don't want no drama
I done lots of shit my mama don't need no more trauma
Make a call to Tommy‚ Tommy he go Ronnie
Double cup of liquor and he goofy off them johnnies
Johnny Tommy's brother
He worked with my mother
Bitch I'm not a kid but I keep Nesquick in the cupboard
It’s funny when I take enough to fuck my day up
I gotta stay up cuz these bitches wanna play
I got my cake up now these bitches wanna piece
I'm crypto rich, no I’m not new to getting paid
Bitch no I’m not famous
Bad hair when it’s raining
Just pulled up to 30th to meet you at the station
I'm driving in the Tesla, yes you sit adjacent
Shout goes to Elon my dude know how to just blaze it
I’m driving fast
I'm driving fast in the whip
I’m driving fast
I'm driving fast in the whip
I just got rich okay
But I dont sell cocaine
In the whip with road rage
I'm in my little lane
I dunno little lames
Tell'em em to get a lane
And they still sound the same
I run around the game
I run it around
Any amount
I hit the bank
I'm cashin out
I take ur bitch huh
Check out the whip huh
Rockin big drums
Different color ping pong
Bitch no I’m not famous
Bad hair when it’s raining
Just pulled up to 30th to meet you at the station
I'm driving in the Tesla‚ yes you sit adjacent
Shout goes to Elon my dude know how to just blaze it
I’m driving fast
I'm driving fast in the whip
I’m driving fast
