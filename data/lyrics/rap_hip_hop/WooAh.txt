Swear I'm just waiting for a reason to bug
I got that itch like spiders creeping up my back
Like Beanie Sigel, I could feel it in the air
Please don't come up over with that-that bullshit
That fake-positive nonsense or that pulpit
They say you wilding 'cause you down bad
Stressing over deposits and there ain't no fly shit in your closet
How can you be happy when that surrounded by the cost
And Rick Ross just keep screaming be a boss
I need a "woo!" like $ah, I need a "woo!"
I need a "woo!" like $ah, I need a "woo!" like

Like, like, like, "Bitch, I'm in the dirt still"
Bitches still want flirt still
Me, I need a baby that's gone pray and go to church still
I need a light, I need an inhale, exhale
Plain white tee, I need some sweet tea and some lemonade and some M&amp;Ms like Renegade
Swear I wanna ball, I wanna boss, I wanna stunt (I wanna stunt)
Put the penny pinchin', dollar grip, and get just what I want
I hit the door, I hit the aisle, I hit the light
I leave the store, I'm heading home, I should decline

I need a "woo!" like $ah, I need a "woo!"
I need a "woo!" like $ah, I need a "woo!" like
Like, like, like
Like when Jermaine hit my phone, I get advice when it's needed
My confidence be on swole, but shit, my pockets is skinny
Skinny waist under her , fine, but ain't worth the chime
Bitches be pretty pennies, bitches be pretty tirin'
They be hella' petty, stressing me out
Bitch, you all in the way, and you blocking the route
Heard she only shut up when the dick in her mouth
Can I woo$ah today? Get the fuck out the way
