If you ain't seen it on the gram I found a new girl
I just wanna let you know I'm in a new world
She ain't ever been in love it's sum new to her
Not me I still remember when your toes curled
But you really more a demon then my old girl
Wanna let you know I really fuckin hate you
Swear you put me through hell tryina date you
You lied about everything
And you wasn't faithful
Everything I did for you you wasn't  greatful
Every time you fucked up I'm the bad guy
Now I got a fine dime Ima brag bout
I remember when you cheated I was mad bout it
Now I hope you see me winnin and you sad bout it
Anyways this new girl been the best to me
When we in bed I call the plays like the referee
The best for me
She never disrespecting me
Rejecting me
And now I see your jealousy
It's ecstasy
I love it
I think I love her it's crazy but hey
We getting closer and close everyday
Wish I could live life with her on replay
Ain't nothing better it's such a cliche
Shit
I be getting butterflies when she next to me
When I look in to her eyes like sex to me
She been getting in my mind so mentally
And I start to get attached so heavily
But damn
