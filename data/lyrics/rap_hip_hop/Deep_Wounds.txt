D. Major, baby

I've been scarred by your love, left my heart bleedin’
My soul posted in the shadows with some dark demons
I'm on the E-way in a fast foreign car speedin'
.223 spit out quick when that chopper ringin’
We ain't never duckin' beef, bitch, we not vegan
My lil' niggas 'bout that action, they be Glock squeezin''
Red beams on his head, now his top leakin'
I heard that boy got man down and now the opps grievin’

I miss Mike Durb, I won’t forget the things you used to say
My friends got killed on the same block where we used to play
I know that death come unexpected, you can't choose a day
I swear I pop so many pills, shit got me losin’ weight
One minute, life was so hard, shit had me losin' faith
I know my haters checkin' on me, I been doin' great
I couldn’t get wrapped up in that drama, had to move away
Everything could change, depend on what you do today
You gotta live with each decision that you choose to make
I used to hustle to survive, I found a newer way
Remember high speeds in the hot car, tryna lose the jakes
You got your life in your hands until you lose a case
So much potential in the lives these niggas threw away
Daydreamin' 'bout my freedom, every night I used to pray
I got that check and stayed loyal, make sure my shooters straight
Heard he went unidentified, them hollows chewed his face
I've been scarred by your love, left my heart bleedin'
My soul posted in the shadows with some dark demons
I'm on the E-way in a fast foreign car speedin'
.223 spit out quick when that chopper ringin'
We ain't never duckin' beef, bitch, we not vegan
My lil' niggas 'bout that action, they be Glock squeezin''
Red beams on his head, now his top leakin'
I heard that boy got man down and now the opps grievin'

Lil Duck hop out in traffic, let them things bust
Lil Joe be buggin', he'll make you give your chain up
This shit too deep, no, I can never give my gang up
Shit'll never be the same, them trenches changed us
My niggas gone, I miss them days when we came up
If I could be with you, give all the money and the fame up
That pain was so unbearable, I almost gave up
First, we was broke, but now I'm swervin' in that Range truck
We was wildin' in them streets, a savage what they named us
When it's violence on our side of town, they blame us
Smith &amp; Wesson torch a nigga, he get flamed up
Them .40 shells crack his head, fuck your brain up

I've been scarred by your love, left my heart bleedin'
My soul posted in the shadows with some dark demons
I'm on the E-way in a fast foreign car speedin'
.223 spit out quick when that chopper ringin'
We ain't never duckin' beef, bitch, we not vegan
My lil' niggas 'bout that action, they be Glock squeezin''
Red beams on his head, now his top leakin'
I heard that boy got man down and now the opps grievin'
