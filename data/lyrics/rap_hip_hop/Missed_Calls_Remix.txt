<<<<<<< HEAD
Another one of these missed calls
Another part of my heart fall
Another part of me contemplating about who really doing who wrong
See this shit was bound to happen it's human nature can't fight that shit
Same shit every fucking day temptations heavy so I light that shit
Escape myself from my human mind just so I could find I ain't like that shit
I'm nothing like, fucking one night when I'm out your sight
Come back when that shit is over, lie to your face, act real tight, that shit ain't me but I know it's you
Now you're heartbroken cuz you broke my heart and I see them, I see them, I see them

I see them tear drops fall
Hearts broke open I just wanna end it all
Cut marks on her wrist signifies our fall
Noose tied around my neck hear the drugs call
She a bad little bitch and she want it all
Passed out on the floor from the alcohol
I didn't wanna tear her down cuz she stand tall
Cryin' lookin' through my phone for her missed calls

Tell me why I'm waiting for someone
That couldn't give a fuck about me

Staring at missed calls, don't know why I
Care to give a fuck about you
This was real love for me
But what about you?
You tell me you never wanted to lose me
I'm seeing see, see, see, see
I see them tear drops fall
Hearts broke open I just wanna end it all
Cut marks on her wrist signifies our fall
Noose tied around my neck hear the drugs call
She a bad little bitch and she want it all
Passed out on the floor from the alcohol
I didn't wanna tear her down cuz she stand tall
Cryin' lookin' through my phone for her missed calls

Tell me why I'm waiting for someone
