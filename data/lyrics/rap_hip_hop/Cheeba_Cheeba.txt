<<<<<<< HEAD
When I get to a party, to get it started
I grab the microphone and rock it cold hearted
Go behind the curtains while my fans just point
You know what Loc's doin, I'm blazin a joint
Cause it seems a lot of times, I'm at my best
After some indica, or a bowl of sess
I'm creatin, multiplyin, big time supplyin
Enough bud, to keep the WHOLE party high on
I might get ill and roll an eighth in one hooter
Park my Benz or cold jet out on my scooter
Bail to the coast, take a hell of a skunk
Twist up a big baba of this serious dope
Smoke it down to the nub, use my roach clip
So much damn resin, it's starting to drip
It ain't harmful like heroin; it's also cheaper
That's why I'm glad homeboy that I
Chorus (x2):
Got that Cheeba!
Cheeba Cheeba
Man, Don't cha hate it when you ain't go no weed
It seems about the time you really feel the need
To get high, get full, you know get blasted
Keep ya singin' the high it really lasted
Rollin' around tryin' not to get popped
By the boyz, the pigs, the rollers, the cops
Pull into one spot to see what they're all about
Suckers noddin' their head, tellin' you they're all out
You go back to the crib, Pick up the telephone
You try everybody so I guess you call Tone
Cause I can buy an O.Z. or go buy dime
I can pay cash for her, I can get it on time
It really makes no difference long as I get lit
Roll it in my Zig Zag, take a big bong hit
Cause after the bud, My rhymes start flowin'
Never gettin' short uh uh uh, they always knowin'
I'm maxin', relaxin', but never taxin'
No need for you to keep on askin'
If it is It, If the Shit is the Shit
Cause when it comes to smokin' cheeba
You know my shit is legit
You're the student, and I'm the teacher
I'm not a minister or reverend, I'm not a preacher
So excuse me while I call time
Cause I'm gonna take a few hits
In the middle of this rhyme.....
CHORUS x2
One day I was coolin' with my homeboy Seal, chill
Getting fucked up in his Coupe De Ville, still
I wasn't too high to know what I was doin'
Went to the store, copped some more brew and
Came back to the car, tried to be a winner
Rolled up all my roaches, barely made a pinner
I wasn't upset I had more at the house
But I was savin' it for later, When I get with my spouse
Cause when we're together, blazin' the cheeba
She does things to me that you wouldn't believe uh
I'm not talkin' kinky or nothin' obscene
But it's not far off if you know what I mean
She'll take me upstairs, lay me down on the bed
Pull off the Fila shorts and start givin' me hizead
If I was boo I'd do the same
She must love it, She ain't never complained
They'll be moanin', kickin', a lot of screamin'
I work it so hard she starts steamin'
You know how it is after a couple of wooers
She was subject and I am the Ruler
She's my freak y'all, but she's no skeeza
One thing for sure, the girl's always got that.....
CHORUS x2
Two weeks ago when I was writin' this rhyme
I had the hydroponic, Boy that shit was fine
I had two joints, One for me and my homie
After half the show, He didn't even know me
His eyes were so tight, they were helluva red
He could barely hold them up, They were heavy as lead
An hour went by, He said Loc I'm kinda hungry
I said "Oh shit! This brothers got the munchies!"
Got off my couch, put my Gucci's on my feet
Went to the 7-11, it was right up the street
I ordered everythin' edible off the shelf
He thought it was shared, I ate it all myself
When we got back to the car, Headed north then south
I needed a drink I had a cotton mouth
We had so much food didn't know where to start
At the Häagan Daas or Kelloggs Pop Tarts
Big bags of chips, gallons of dips
It took me weeks to get the taste of my lips
I ate so much miserable is how I felt
Almost busted out my pants had to loosen my belt
Kickin at the tube, watchin' none better than
You know the king of late night, Yeah Dave Letterman
Not too hilarious, jokes kinda plain
But everything is funny when you're smoking Mary Jane.....
Outro:
Mary Jane
Mary Jane
Yeah... Tell 'em 'bout it baby
I'm in love with Mary Jane
She's my main thing
She makes me feel all right
She makes my heart sing
