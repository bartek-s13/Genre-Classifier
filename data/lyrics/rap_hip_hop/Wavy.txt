Shit getting way too crazy, I'm getting way too Wavy
Shit getting way too crazy, I'm getting way too Wavy
I held you down when you wasn't around and you still betrayed me
You thought the money would change me
It didn't do nothing but save me (X2)
Verse:
Shit getting way too crazy
I held it down for this money I keep it 100 won't nun of it change
I held you down and you played me
I won't let nun of it phase me
I came from nothing to something
The way that you coming is way too shady
I gave my niggas sum fame
I gave my bitches sum game
I put you up in a Range
Bitch how the fuck could you change ?
I'll bust yo brain for this chain
I run it up for these rings
Don't throw yo life down the drain
Tryna keep up with these lames
I'm tryna window this pain
Pouring up more of this drank
I got my top down in the winter time and I'm still cruising
I got these diamonds on me In the summer time and I'm still cooling
Chorus:
Shit getting way too crazy, I'm getting way too Wavy
Shit getting way too crazy, I'm getting way too Wavy
I held you down when you wasn't around and you still betrayed me
You thought the money would change me
It didn't do nothing but save me (X2)
