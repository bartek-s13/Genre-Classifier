Intro:
Birth of a Nation was bathed in blood
No reparation can pay enough
Amen, John Brown paid for us
We won’t, no we won’t, beg for love…
Verse 1:
I awoke in the middle of the mountain, I was cast in the color of thieves
I was cast in the color of talcum powder, cash in the ash tray please
I am but the last of a past gone dream, I am but the last of malignancy
I am but the last of a tumor ridden mass that is soon to crash into lunacy
I assume these fumes are just from the fracking that is happening under my two feet
I am not much of one for redacting from the fact that I am gassing my sheep
Well, tactically what a catastrophe, or is it actually just a masterpiece
I’m the color of a master alabaster but I have more in common with the lower class blacks, peace…
Calling all sons and daughters, I smell blood in the water
Carry every gun to the slaughter, Harpers Ferry follow John Brown
And bury everyone by the end of the song now that’s my mantra
But I’m jaundiced from these toxins like I’m living with a liver gone beyond its limits
I’m an abolitionist and I promise this no armistice all bombs and clips
There is no more hope for my people some are pure evil, most just exist
The allure is that they’re not lethal but I know their ignorance is not bliss, no…
Chorus:
No we won’t get down and beg, won’t get down and beg
No we won’t get down and beg for love…
Verse 2:
Already failed here, already failed, everybody come and get a cross and a nail
Everybody wanna come and watch a body flail but nobody wanna take a shot-make a bullet sail
Bully in my pulpit but I’m railroaded no sailboat won’t bail in Potomac
Who would’ve known nobody would’ve rose no revolt, now I’m revolted and sullen
Look at what’s left of the munitions I’ve stolen, look at my life and I’m never soft-spoken
If I’ve gotta die fuck it I’ll die smoking, guns blazing on a hangman’s trophy
So much pain need an ibuprofen I won’t ghost it, looking at the line and the line got broken quarters closing
Orders from the top say no holds barred on the final charge so I won’t hold it
Watch my Sherman’s March to the ocean, carnage crony
Do my part with a torch in my hand I’m the scourge of this land and I’m
Scorching all earth and burning all bands of these vermin assorted by purchasing man
It’s my personal plan to start forcing the hand of these southern white churches supporting the Klan
Pockets full of posies opponents won’t stand when I proceed to scan…damn
Now I’m at the courthouse with the cuffs on my hands no blood of the lamb
About to be dusted, immortal beloved, but sorely disgusted my country won’t stand…
Chorus:
