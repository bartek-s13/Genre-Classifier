Magma and broken earth
No one can know the hurt
Until the dirt slips out
From beneath your feet
But for some reason
You caught me

Sometimes I think back
On that moment
When we both had known
It was over
We looked off the edge
Ready to step
Until you said
“May I have this dance?”
Slow dancing
In the rain
At the end of the world
At the end of the world
Slow dancing
In the rain
At the end of the world
At the end of the world

Heaven and Hell collide
I’ll stay in limbo tonight
You took my heart and soul
But you left me hope

Sometimes I think back
On that moment
When we both had known
It was over
We looked off the edge
Ready to step
Until you said
“May I have this dance?”
Slow dancing
In the rain
At the end of the world
At the end of the world
Slow dancing
In the rain
At the end of the world
At the end of the world

All those years
Came down
To one dance
All those tears
Wiped clean
By your hands
