I don't wanna die
Yeah, sad that this type of shit is always on my mind
But it's come to a time
Where it's never safe to be outside
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Tired of the murders that I'm seeing on the news
Hoping it's a dream then I come to see it's true
Hold onto your love you'll never know who you lose
I can't even look at my phone without feeling blue

Hold me tight
Hold me tight
I just might not be here tomorrow
So hold me tight, through the night
Or you'll live with pain and the sorrow
Hold me tight
Hold me tight
I just might not be here tomorrow
So hold me tight, through the night
Or you'll live with pain and the sorrow
Hold me tight
Hold me tight
I just might not be here tomorrow
So hold me tight, through the night
Or you'll live with pain and the sorrow
Hold me tight
Hold me tight
I just might not be here tomorrow
So hold me tight, through the night
Or you'll live with pain and the sorrow

Hoo-oo-oo-ooh
Now I feel like I'm alone
Hoo-oo-oo-ooh
Wishing you to come back home
Where was there an issue, what went wrong
Now I'm gonna miss you all life long
Now I'm in the sky and your all alone
Crying in the heavens all day long

Hold me tight
Hold me tight
I just might not be here tomorrow
So hold me tight, through the night
Or you'll live with pain and the sorrow
Hold me tight
Hold me tight
I just might not be here tomorrow
So hold me tight, through the night
Or you'll live with pain and the sorrow

Hold me tight
Hold me tight(aye, aye, aye)
