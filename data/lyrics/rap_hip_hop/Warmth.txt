<<<<<<< HEAD
Baby you gotta Skype me, Facetime me
You already know I'm going digital
Send some Snapchats, yeah I'm tryna catch that
Hearts be cold up in the snow
Tryna see the car speed go up in the rows
Yeah my heart beat cold up in the snow
And my heart bleed go you can see the rose
From my head to my toes
I don't really know, where we gonna go, but just know we show up
But I'm honor role, I'm above it all, So just know we show love
Everywhere I go, I just want it all, so I roll it all up
On your college floor, you a know-it-all
This ain't honor role, yeah

What If I told you, bury me on the moon? (Me on the moon)
Then who would read what the fuck they wrote on my tomb? (Who the fuck gonna read it?)
I'm a gift from the planets, you don't need to understand it (You understand)
Setting a vibe right the second I walk in the room
I'm just one thing, to the next thing
Dollar signs when I'm texting
I feel good, I feel proud, don't mind saying "next please"
Strategized stressed out chess piece
I be flying with my jet wings
Need my Sun shades and the jet ski, I be taking over gently
Baby you gotta Skype me, Facetime me
You already know I'm going digital
Send some Snapchats, yeah I'm tryna catch that
Hearts be cold up in the snow
Tryna see the car speed go up in the rows
Yeah my heart beat cold up in the snow
And my heart bleed go you can see the rose
From my head to my toes
I don't really know, where we gonna go, but just know we show up
But I'm honor role, I'm above it all, So just know we show love
Everywhere I go, I just want it all, so I roll it all up
On your college floor, you a know-it-all
