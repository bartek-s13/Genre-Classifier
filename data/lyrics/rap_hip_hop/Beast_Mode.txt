<<<<<<< HEAD
They say this young nigga stuntin' like Steve O
Shoutout the plug came up on a kilo
Rolled the dice played the game like cee-lo
And he ain't never look up to no hero
Came up and he started from zero
Said that broke shit ain't in his stilo
Got thirty rounds, he ain't gotta reload
Got a taste of the money, now he's in beast mode

Got a taste of the money, now he's in beast mode
In the study gotta letter couple cheat codes
I'm in Ctown cooling with Cheeko
Lean up the pint and we got the weed rolled
And my niggas blood thirsty like piranhas
Get gitty when it come to that drama
Flip a nigga whole side osama
And my youngin gonna risk it for them dollars
How your hittas stay jakes outta driver
Now you is in some real deal, hot fire
Phones tap better stay off the wire
Trap house cooking Lizzie McGuire
Said the dope boy what she desire
So she rolling with me like a tire
They say I stunt so hard no stylist
But this drip too hard can't style this

They say this young nigga stunting like Steve O
Shoutout the plug came up on a kilo
Rolled the dice played the game like ceelow
And he ain't never look up to no hero
Came up and he started from zero
Said that broke shit ain't in his estilo
Got thirty rounds, he ain't gotta reload
Got a taste of the money, now he's in beast mode

He ain't never look up to no hero
He ain't never look up to no negro
Seen a kilo then he went Rico
Chip the whole brick down went beast mode
Remember she was right there where you blew the heater
A lot of jakes at the door with subpoenas
Take her out crush a case like a penut
Take a flight outta town with the reup
And i'm always kick up with my feet up
Louis V sneaks on when he creep up
This that free smoke nigga free shisha
Come get it while it's hot like pizza
With a bad bitch cooling with a model
Said she wanna drink Henny out the bottle
Said a phone call fast get her startled
I be riding, doing the dash full throttle

They say this young nigga stunting like Steve O
Shoutout the plug came up on a kilo
Rolled the dice played the game like ceelow
And he ain't never look up to no hero
Came up and he started from zero
Said that broke shit ain't in his estilo
Got thirty rounds, he ain't gotta reload
