I ain't tryna be nobody's hero, ya know
My heart is 3 below zero, below

Saint Laurent and Quarter Water
Show me you could really be your momma's daughter
'Cause I ain't tryna be nobody's hero, ya know
My heart is 3 below zero, below

Gucci slippers girl you poppin', ya know
The way you look I know you got them niggas flockin'
And you got them Rihanna dreads
Now you deserve a nigga with a Kawasaki, ouu

Saint Laurent and Quarter Water, ya' know
Show me you could really be your momma's daughter, oh
I ain't tryna be nobody's hero, ya know
My heart is 3 below zero, below

You know I like them ratchet bitches, ya know
You know I tell her suck it 'fore she ask permission, oh
You know I make 'em all audition, oh
Four naked bitches this is New Edition, oh
I was out here ridin' round, ya know
I was only juggin' on my part of town, oh
I'm gon' need you quiet now, oh
Know you see me ballin' don't go out of bounds, oh
Saint Laurent and Quarter Water
Show me you could really be your momma's daughter
'Cause I ain't tryna be nobody's hero, ya know
My heart is 3 below zero, below

Girl you got a bright future, ouu
Damn you look nice girl, the lights suit ya
I prefer you naked
If your head's good you'll make a nice tutor
I don't mean no disrespect, no
But I prefer Shaniqua over Elizabeth
Me, I like them ratchet bitches, oh
Only hit her once a year, that's after Christmas, yeah

Saint Laurent and Quarter Water, ya' know
Show me you could really be your momma's daughter, oh
'Cause I ain't tryna' be nobody's hero, ya know
My heart is 3 below zero, below
Saint Laurent and Quarter Water, ya' know
Show me you could really be your momma's daughter, oh
'Cause I ain't tryna' be nobody's hero, ya know
My heart is 3 below zero, below
Ooh oh, ooh oh, ooh oh
