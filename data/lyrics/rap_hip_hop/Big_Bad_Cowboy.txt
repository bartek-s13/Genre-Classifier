Major Grammar

I'm a big, bad, cowboy, run through my veins
Back roads, ridin' horses, I be switchin' the lanes
It's just me and my posse, we're ready to rumble
Anybody step to me, he's a goner
I'm a big, bad, cowboy, I love drinkin' beer
My wife Jenny cooks, mm, smells like a deer
It's just me and my hoes, 'bout to plow these fields
I see a big, bad, cowboy when I look in the mirror, hey, hey

Motherfuck that, and motherfuck this
I sick and tired of steppin' in this fuckin' dog shit
I got my overalls on and I'm 'bout to go to and fish
I got my jaw filled up with tobacco dip
Don't you try me, bitch, revolver's on my hip
Drinkin' moonshine, it burns when I take a sip
Holy shit, that's a motherfuckin' smokin' hot bitch
Walked up on her, asked her, "Baby, would you like to suck my dick?"
If she don't, oh well, that's a blessin' that she missed
I'm nine feet tall if I'm standin' on my dick
If she suck it, she'll get hoarse, I'm kin to a horse
Got a big, bad, hammer, bitch, my name should've been Thor

I'm a big, bad, cowboy, run through my veins
Back roads, ridin' horses, I be switchin' the lanes
It's just me and my posse, we're ready to rumble
Anybody step to me, he's a goner
I'm a big, bad, cowboy, I love drinkin' beer
My wife Jenny cooks, mm, smells like a deer
It's just me and my hoes, 'bout to plow these fields
