Lately I've been drownin' in depression
I don't know why everything has to be a lesson
Why everybody feel my life is so perfect
Like I'm not like you, like everyday I ain't stressin'?
And don't be tryna tell me what you think is best for me
'Cause when I needed you most, you wasn't there for me
So many people tryna jeopardize my destiny
Man, I can't let these things get to me
Not too many answers, so many issues
So many teardrops, not too many tissues
Times get rough, close ones, will forget you
But then they come around when they see it's beneficial
Man, this shit is crazy, I'm tryna make a change
I'm tryna be the reason you ain't gotta see the rain
I'm tryna be that person that will cover up your stain
But no matter what I do I'm always covered with the blame

Sometimes I wish there was a pill to heal my heart
Or maybe a band-aid that could cover up these scars
But nothing is ever strong enough
Nothing is ever good enough

I wake up every morning and I ask myself
"Is life worth living, should I blast myself?"
I got so many thoughts in my head
Like, "What's the point of even livin' when I'd rather be dead?"
Now, am I another victim to my misery?
Or maybe everything I'm thinkin' is all in my mind
Why does that everything I want is a mystery?
And everything that I don't is easy to find
I used to want to go to party with all my friends
Until I got comfortable with the lonely nights
And lately I've been smokin' tryna get me high
It's so ironic 'cause deep inside I'm afraid of heights
But I still do it, and now it's a must
And now I'm just another piece of sand in the dust
See, I can give you everything and leave me with the crust
But no matter what I do, man, it's never good enough
Sometimes I wish there was a pill to heal my heart
Or maybe a band-aid that could cover up these scars
But nothing is ever strong enough
Nothing is ever good enough

Sometimes I wish there was a pill to heal my heart
Or maybe a band-aid that could cover up these scars
But nothing is ever strong enough
Nothing is ever good enough
