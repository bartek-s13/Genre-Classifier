(Big Jeezy got it lock boy)
(VERSE 1)
LORD!
Drop down and get your jiggle one (Hey)
Pop style and get your drinking one (Hey)
Cuz I don’t know if she’ll want me
Ain’t a lot of time for me SHAWTY
And I can’t blame you none shawty
You know that you my BABY
It ain’t none to go crazy
Ain’t no juice in the morning
No, ain’t no love in the morning
As much as you tried to shade me
You know that you can’t play me
(She could stay)
(CHORUS)
Vini’m pale cherie
Vini’m pale doudou
Vini’m pale cherie
Vini’m pale doudou

(VERSE 2)
Yeah
Ocean Ave flow, thinking how we got far
The summer, in hot cars
The women, they drop jaws
Where I’m from the dope boys is the rock stars
But we can’t cop cars without seeing cop cars
IT’S THE BLOCK BOYZ 50
It’s a celebration (Gltttt)
(Hey)
Please don’t make me hop in my bag, hop in my (Bltttt)
(Hey)
All it took was love, all it took was patience
Everyone screaming out that’s a fact
We screaming out that’s a (Fltttt)
(Whoa)
Somewhere in my feelings knowing someway they gon feel me
Wanna give my mom a Grammy but somehow she wants some children
I told her I’m just into committing or rebuilding
I’ll touch a million hearts before I ever touch a million
She told me start a label myself
Don’t ask me what I’m bringing to the table when I brought the table myself
I mean just look at all the tables I helped
And you was right mama
Now they say I’m bitter cuz I said how I felt, yeah
And everybody asking when’s the tape coming
Well, what if it ain’t coming
What if I told you I need a break from it
Half of y’all would probably cut away from it
And the other half already prayed on it
Say what you say homie
Somewhere in my feelings knowing someway they gon feel me
And I can’t help to think that someday they gon kill me
Partied all week but this Sunday gon be chilling
Playing Party on repeat for the summer, In My Feelings
(CHORUS)
Vini’m pale cherie
Vini’m pale doudou
Vini’m pale cherie
Vini’m pale doudou
Yeah
Vini’m pale cherie
Vini’m pale doudou
If I said I wanted you
Oh if I saved my love for you I swear
Choko choko la la
M'pral'manje yon chokola
Choko choko la la
M'pral'manje yon chokola
