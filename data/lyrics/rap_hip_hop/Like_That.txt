Ayy CJ!
This shit hard as fuck
And you know where I'm at, and y'all know where I'll be
Where we at though?
In this bitch with Wes, yeah

A-S-S, you niggas can't rap
I be talkin' my shit cause' I know I'm like that
If the strap in the whip, then it's cool, I gotta knife
Fuck your bitch in the bed, that you callin' your wife
And she left yo' ass cause' you couldn't do right
But you can't have her back cause' the pussy aight'
And you just gettin' head, but I got it first night
And my dick K.O., cause' I gave her night night
Like ouu, ouu, nigga I'm crazy
Diploma after school, I ain't get it, I'm lazy
Them niggas, they still call me
They be like Jaah, just dropped a 60
Fuck that, I don't need it
Make loafs, y'all keep it
Boy, I go stupid, I might just lose it
Live next to the cops, but a nigga still trappin'
No, I'm not cappin', but my brothers brackin'
But I cannot bang, cause' my cousins crippin'
You hoes be laces, cause' y'all stay trippin'
I don't even know what the fuck I be doin'

Pulled up to the crib
They be chillin' and shit
Hear a nigga on the phone
Askin' if you comin' to my birthday and shit
She like, "yeah", and I'm like, "wait"
Go ahead and tell that lil' bitch ass nigga he finna be late

STG, a lot of shit happen
But I ain't no bitch, lemme' stop all the talkin'
Hit from the back, on god that shit was movin'
A nigga so gone, I ain't know what I was doin'
But shit, lemme' stop, reload, we gon' pop
Them crackers, they can't catch me
I run a 4.5, yeah, I call it track speed
SLT from CLT, we so high, can't fuckin see
Don't give a fuck what a nigga talkin' bout'
See what I'm smokin' on, this the best in the south

Huh, yeah, best in the south
Nigga, this the best in the south
I'm saying anything, I'm off the Percocet
