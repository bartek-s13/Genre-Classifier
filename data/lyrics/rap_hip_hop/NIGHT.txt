Cross my heart and hope to die
Might not make it through tonight
Ask you once, I'll ask you twice
Am I who you want late at night?

I be wonderin' if I'm the only one
Like would you want me still if I ain't have this Louis on?
Until you came around I was comin' down
But then you changed it all, need you forever now

Talkin' to myself ain't as fun
I only keep you 'round 'cause I know that you're the one
I woke up in a room that wasn't mine just because
Lookin' in your eyes got me thinkin' 'bout us

Cross my heart and hope to die
Might not make it through tonight
Ask you once, I'll ask you twice
Am I who you want late at night?
Cross my heart and hope to die
Might not make it through tonight
Ask you once, I'll ask you twice
Am I who you want late at night?
