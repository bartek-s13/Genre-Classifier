There's roses in your hair
Yeah
'Cause beauty hurts sometimes
But that's okay
And I'll just stay
To take the thorns out one at a time
There's roses in your hair (Your hair)
Yeah
'Cause beauty hurts (Beauty hurts)
Sometimes (Sometimes I)
But that's okay (That's okay)
And I'll just stay (I'll just stay)
To take the thorns out one at a time
There's roses in your hair (Roses in your hair)
Yeah
'Cause beauty hurts (Beauty hurts)
Sometimes (Sometimes I)
But that's okay (That's okay)
And I'll just stay (I'll just stay)
To take the thorns out one at a time (One more time)
There's roses in your hair (ahhhhh, ah-ahm)
Yeah (ahhhhh, ah-ahm)
'Cause beauty hurts (ahhhhh, ah-ahhhhh-ahm)
Sometimes (Sometimes I)
But that's okay (ahhhhh, hoh-ohhhh)
And I'll just stay (I'll just stay)
To take the thorns out one at a time (Ohhhh, oh-hoh)
One more time

The things we remember never go to plan
That's a fancy way of sayin' "You should let me hold your hand"
Yeah
And we was here as friends
But the waves keep roll; now it's 3 AM
As we talk
Tick-Tock
Get lost
Lips lock - well, almost
Yeah, I got this feeling that you get me
And there's something that we want that neither of us ready for, see:

Duct tape on my heart but I know that you, you feel the same
No we ain't perfect! But perfect ain't a thang
Oh what a shame! This holds us back
We can't hold ourselves together... at least let me hold your hand
(There's roses in your hair)

(Yeah)
Let me hold your hand!
('Cause beauty hurts sometimes)
Let me just hold your hand
(And that's okay)
No plans
(And I'll just stay)
No games
(To take the thorns out one at a time)
We can be the same

There's roses in your hair (ahhhhh, ah-ahm)
Yeah (ahhhhh, ah-ahm)
'Cause beauty hurts (ahhhhh, ah-ahhhhh-ahm)
Sometimes (Sometimes I)
But that's okay (ahhhhh, hoh-ohhhh)
And I'll just stay (I'll just stay)
To take the thorns out one at a time (Ohhhh)
There's roses in your hair
Yeah
'Cause beauty hurts sometimes
But that's okay
And I'll just stay
To take the thorns out one at a time
There's roses in your hair
