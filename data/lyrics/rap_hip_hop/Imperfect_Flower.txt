Sunshine gon' come with rainy days, codiene take the pain away
Kobe at the three, while down by two, Dwyane gon' fade away
I know they hate I made a way, for my niggas I paved a way
I'm at the top, they at the bottom starvin'
Guess that mean it's safe to say
That I really came from the trenches
They throwin' dirt on top my name, I got no love for these bitches
Fuck all the cameras and the fame, I came in for the riches
This Crip shit runnin' in my veins, ask the Lord for forgiveness
Just had a talk with Tim mama, she say I'm an idol and I lead the way
She know this gun not in my title, for my life she hit her knees and pray
She know that niggas want me dead, that's why this Smith & Wesson on my waist
She hate the fact that I'm a Crip, I throw my C's up at them Heaven gates
It ain't no love inside my heart, I left my feelings drowning in a lake
I put my trust inside an envelope, then mailed it to another state
They tryna judge me by my lifestyle, plus these tats that's on my fuckin' face
But I'm a live this fuckin' lifestyle from the cradle to the fuckin' grave

How do you know when you love someone?
When deep down in your soul you can't love no one
When you done done so much, you can't trust no one
I feel I'm walkin' down the wrong road
How do you know when you love someone?
When deep down in your soul you can't love no one
When you done done so much, you can't trust no one
I feel I'm walkin' down the wrong road

Standin' in court, look back, my mama cryin'
Like "Son, I told you this so many times"
Judge told me speak before I caught my time
Taught me a lesson, true love hard to find
Juvenile prison where the biz' is Belly
Locked on Carl Griffin with no commissary
Livin' in hell, pray to the missionary
Stuck in the cell when my grandma got buried
Bloody t-shirts to obituaries
I seen them fold in different situations
I seen the realest turn fake
We slang that K, then it's blood on the pavement
I been thuggin' since I went to Haven
I done seen killas make a statement
Walkin' down a long road, look back, don't see nobody wavin'
Turn 'round the corner, jump out with the pole
Two Swisher Sweets, a pill, a pack of poles
That choppa roll a nigga up like dope
Them dolla bills'll make 'em kick yo door
We in the field, and that's one thing for sure
I had to learn somethin' you taught to hold
I'm thinkin' hard like I ain't thought before
That 30 clip is a part of my pose
I'm pourin' lean 'til I can't pour no more
Ride through the streets like I'm not goin' home
What's understood ain't gotta be explained, it's too much goin' on
Murder runnin' through my veins like heroin in a needle
How do you know when you got love from your people?

How do you know when you love someone?
When deep down in your soul you can't love no one
When you done done so much, you can't trust no one
I feel I'm walkin' down the wrong road
How do you know when you love someone?
When deep down in your soul you can't love no one
When you done done so much, you can't trust no one
I feel I'm walkin' down the wrong road
