I told her don’t be falling in love with me, I’m a nightmare
I might show her love, but that don’t mean I’m gonna wife her
She expects too much but for some reason I might like her
Here we go again, I’ve got to end it, leave it right there
Trap queen, trap queen, I need a trap queen
I need a girl to hold it down and keep my Mac clean
She told me hit it from the back and bring my mash in
She got me feeling like the man, I'm what she fancies

Let the story begin
Tremz I'm an open book when I mix the good and the sin (Sinning)
That’s the ying and the yang go out with a boom and a bang I’ll always win
No matter whatever the outcome, baby I'll always win
Ay, scouse trappin
Don’t get me mad
All these naked pictures you’ve been sending get me gassed
And you say you got a boyfriend but we know it won’t last
Because I’ll be on your mind, no gettin' rid of that
I know you wanna be mine, I could change your life
She's calling me her plumber 'cause I only give her pipe
Wanna stay the night, I’m gonna hit it more than twice
Aaahhh

I told her don’t be falling in love with me, I’m a nightmare
I might show her love, but that don’t mean I’m gonna wife her
She expects too much but for some reason I might like her
Here we go again, I’ve got to end it, leave it right there
Trap queen, trap queen, I need a trap queen
I need a girl to hold it down and keep my Mac clean
She told me hit it from the back and bring my mash in
She got me feeling like the man, I'm what she fancies
She asked me what’s my poison
I told her I drink Henny
She told me that we’re getting messy ‘till these bottles empty
I told her, “girl that’s heavy, why you tryna get me buried?”
She told me Tremzy, I’m a rider baby, always ready
Don’t get me gassed
If I’m hitting that tonight baby, I’m gonna spaz
She like Tremzy you’re the man and I need me scouse trap
No matter whatever the outcome, I'm not your man
I told her don’t be falling in love with me, I’m a nightmare
I might show her love, but that don’t mean I’m gonna wife her
She expects too much but for some reason I might like her
Here we go again, I’ve got to end it, leave it right there
Trap queen, trap queen, I need a trap queen
I need a girl to hold it down and keep my Mach clean
She told me hit it from the back and bring my mash in
She got me feeling like the man, I'm what she fancies

Trap queen, trap queen, I need a trap queen
Trap queen, trap queen, I need a trap queen
Trap queen, trap queen, I need a trap queen
Trap queen, trap trap queen, trap
