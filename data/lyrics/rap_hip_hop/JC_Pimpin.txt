I came quite a way and Ray’s not done yet
I’m hittin’ threes all day while lames cryin’ to the ref
Try to sell ya second best, just a waste a time
I try to keep my pace laced with wit world news headlines
TMZ won’t need a flash because the boy shines
Girls go crazy gimme head lose they mind
Success on my mind, success on time
Never second-guess the lesson lesson on me
Most a you claimin’ a full tank really on E
Never seen a Molly never seen a Mary Jane
Mayne you suckas sound lame and you never wore chukkas
Ma’fuckas stop playin’ make me go Super Saiyan
What you really sayin’
Lo ciento, no entiendo
I came to spend dough smokin’ up a limo
En route to the in-store, baby shift my stick slow

Joe Cool Pimpin’
Caught in the oval office kept Mrs. Clinton
Blue skirt missin’, girl you feel different
See I can’t be impeached this Joe Cool Pimpin’
Blue skirt missin’, girl you feel different
See I can’t be impeached this Joe Cool Pimpin’

Joe Cool Pimpin’
Caught in the oval office kept Mrs. Clinton
The boy shines got the whole room squintin’
Free shades for the kid when he walk in
Shout out to Blasfome family we’ll never fit in
Be our own person was the plan from the beginnin’
And the same reason on a daily why we winnin’
Cheshire Cat grinnin’ yeah we big face gettin’
Uh, ya broad’s a pigeon
A little bread in the park she flaunt that kitten
My nuts a baseball, her face a mitten
This ain’t a prank call this is how I’m livin’
I’m gettin’ dipped in pure gold when I die
Don’t slow when I die, live it up before you die
Baby girl let’s slide ya man’s blowin’ my high
Don’t even tell that mothafucka bye
