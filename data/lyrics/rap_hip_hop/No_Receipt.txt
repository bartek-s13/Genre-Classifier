Chorus:
Coupe hopping, drugs wit no receipt
You the only the thing that I can drean
You the only one that I could see with me, yuh
You the only one that I can dream 'bout when I sleep, yuh
Intro:
Heard you coming home with me
But now we feeling free
Mmm, We hop under the sheets
Do the pills and then we speed
We had a few drinks, yeah
Now you on with me
Pop the pills and then we speed, yeah
But that's cause you agree
Verse 1:
She like listen I only just want the closure
Im like I can take you every place you wanna go yeah

We gon' fuck and let my grab up on the cake tho

Girl I know we had a night
But girl I ain't wanna fight

In that shiny silver armor
Lemme just protect you from all emotions that haunt ya
Don't this feel like magic the way you never feel harmed yuh
This dream ain't to far yuh
This dream ain't to far yuh
