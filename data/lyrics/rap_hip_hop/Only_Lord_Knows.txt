Only Lord Knows
O. L. K
Lifestyle edition
Nobody Do It Like I do It

Lord knows what's going on
Only Lord knows we the bomb
It's good to say me and my neggas won
If u hate men we don't give a fuck, 2x
I been killing shits since '09
Real lifestyle, me n my neggas front line
20 bitches in my bed am so hard
Swag swag we always stay fly
Lord knows what's going on
Only Lord knows we the bomb
It's good to say me and my neggas won
If u hate men we don't give a fuck, 2x

OH Lord, many neggas wanna make it to the top but they never wanna pray hard
All our shits dope, needs to be sold, but we gave it for free, pure love
Conversation with the skies, neggas so fly, know what I'm saying? (Nam saying?) Yeah bro!
Muthafucker Nam saying? Yeah bro!
We bought a new toy and you still waiting for the Uber
The neggas so blessed, oh Lord, hallelujah
We kill 'em in the game and we kill 'em at other side of life but y3se meny3 killer
Even the kush we blow you can't afford
The fam I know is 7 folks
Blue tick, ignore the calls
Bitches wear our clothes u know?
