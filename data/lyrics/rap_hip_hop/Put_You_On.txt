Lando made the tracks
I could put you on
I could put you on

I could put you on
All the things that I did, I'll never show, yeah
I could put you on
All the time, this be runnin’ through my mind
And baby, I could break the bank (Yeah)
Get it back (Back)
Tuckin' them hundreds up in the stash (In the stash)
Fifties, we flip 'em and make it last (Make it last)
Whatever we went through is in the past
I could put you on

I know you love when I’m Gucci and lookin' shoes
Sometimes I'm thinking and worrying what to do
We could just do the Beamer or do in the Benz coupe
I could put you on to the zoes and the scams
All this cheatin', it wasn't part of the plan
VVS in my diamonds, they know they dance
20K in my pants, designer, it come from France
Make a mil and go cop a McLaren
Ain't got time for the bullshit a nigga been hearin'
Baby girl, you fucked up, other bitches lucked up
All these bitches like me, ain't no nigga like me
Big bankrolls, they lovin’ the way I get ’em
Cuban link froze, they lovin' the way it’s swingin'
I'ma start flexin', just hold on and wait a minute
Came up from the mud, my nigga, and now I’m shittin'
And now a nigga famous, it's dangerous
Baby, tú estás bueno, I'm switchin' my language
Once a nigga signed a deal, emotions was changing
Even though I'm in your guts, my feelings is fading
You was always moving funny, I would never say shit
I just copped a new car, it look like a spaceship
I been fuckin' new blondes, I ain't got no patience
Now you wanna act right but I'm tired of waitin', 'cause...

I could put you on
All the things that I did, I'll never show, yeah
I could put you on
All the time, this be runnin' through my mind
And baby, I could break the bank (Yeah)
Get it back (Back)
Tuckin' them hundreds up in the stash (In the stash)
Fifties, we flip 'em and make it last (Make it last)
Whatever we went through is in the past

I need good vibes only, I don't even want you back
And these bitches do it too, so baby, let's talk the facts
But when I was down, you was never nowhere to be found
Now I'm glowing up and you always wanna come around
I put ten chains on me, diamond rings on me
Iced out watch and I got the thing on me
Bitch, you used me and confused me
Now a nigga movin' bougie, I'ma do me, yeah, yeah
You know I could've put you on
All the games that you played, I played along
I know you gon' hear this song
I just hope you sing along
Big bankrolls, they lovin' the way I get 'em
Cuban link froze, they lovin' the way it's swingin'
I'ma start flexin', just hold on and wait a minute
Came up from the mud, my nigga, and now I'm shittin'

I could put you on
All the things that I did, I'll never show, yeah
I could put you on
All the time, this be runnin' through my mind
And baby, I could break the bank (Yeah)
Get it back (Back)
Tuckin' them hundreds up in the stash (In the stash)
Fifties, we flip 'em and make it last (Make it last)
Whatever we went through is in the past
