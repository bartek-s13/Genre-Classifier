Prettiboi

It feels so simple
Loving, always
It feels just right
I, can't explain it

Yeah, Powfu
Walkin' into town, as I cut across the park
It's rainy every day, maybe I should build a Ark
See you with your friend group, lonely like I always am
Gave a silent wave but, I don't think you noticed it
Thinkin' of what happened as I continue my walk
I grew up in this town, but somehow I'm feelin' lost
Wishin' I was cool, why does everybody fit in?
Tryna make friends so long, it's time I quit this
Word around town, that you hard to get
I'mma put a end to that, I'mma start some shit
I'll put a spark in it, yeah I don't care what it takes
I'm sick of bein' alone, no longer I'm away (wait up for me)
Yeah, I just wanna chat
Maybe we can talk, when we both walk back
Side by side on the sidewalk, feelin' nervous
If you end up mine, me and you would look perfect, yeah
It feels so simple
Loving, always
It feels just right
I, can't explain it

Me and you would look perfect
Me and you would look perfect

Me and you would look perfect
You could keep me by your side, like a purses
Purpose, I'mma find that with you
Everybody wanna talk about your attitude
But that's why I could see through all the problems
Seein' your priorities, I know I'm at the bottom
I promise that I'mma be the best for you
Like chess moves, you the Queen, I'm protectin' you
Come and walk with me, and we could talk a bit
I could shelter you, from all the moccasins
Lotta snakes in the grass where we live
It's not much, but I'll give you everything I have to give
My life, my soul, every beat of my heart
Ain't nobody in the world that could tear us apart
If you want, we could just slow dance
I could hold you forever, I just need once chance, yeah
It feels so simple
Loving, always
It feels just right
