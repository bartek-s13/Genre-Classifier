Just put me right there on top of the list
Enough of this shit
Who really spitting tougher this
I really rose from the bottom like I ball for the Knicks
Need a Spanish chick with a lil tropical twist
I can really see me in em porches on a Forbes list
Man I be feeling both of my palms itch
I'm taking every shot.. Prolly do better than Curry I don't miss
Ambition is just something you born with.. Its real facts
I hope you get to resonate with the message
You got a gift just don't play with package
And its crazy cos they never seem to teach us to be greater than average
I need that bread tryna make me a sandwich
And Imma get it
Go way beyond the limit
Like pictures my bars are vivid...
Rappers are far from gifted
Spit crack so my tongue illicit ugh
It's clear that I got something to prove...
Like I'm Q man I'm stuck with the juice

Let's a make a love scene (Hook)

I'm cold as it gets
Tryna stay focused on this
Took me 4 and half minutes when I wrote to this shit
Do it tryna give hope to the kids
This that nose candy for the fiends I really got blow you can sniff
Tell em spare me the bullshit.,, I hate to be part of it
Scared to get it done but still claiming you not a bitch
The beat my canvas and I just be painting a lotta pics
I'm prolly the hottest how could you fail to acknowledge it huh
Just don't trip I got it all planned out
It'll be crazy stories talking how it all panned out
Just spent 50 thinking fuck I gotta ball less now
The easy way I'm like nah I'll ply the hardest route huh
We started off and never focused on making a profit
Its coming now its all a game and I play with a purpose
In the booth I open up but won't say it in person
I need the dough for some cake in a oven ugh
Let's a make a love scene (Hook)
