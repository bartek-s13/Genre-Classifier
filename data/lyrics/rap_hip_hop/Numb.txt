Don't know why I still try
And she wonders why I
I don't trust anybody
Not even her

She understands that
I don't trust nobody
Not even her
Don't wanna still try
She understands that

Hello God it's me again
Hoping that you hearing this
I been in my feelings yeah
I just wanna feel again
Don't know how to cope with this
Maybe you could help with this
I been suicidal since you never fucking help with shit
Honestly depression has been getting worse
I wanna feel some emotion even if it hurts
Even though all the vision has been fucking blurred
It's clear to see that you hate me
God damn all the words
Last time that I prayed
You told me to stay
Through all of the night, yeah
All through the day
Man fuck all the pain
Take a bullet to the brain
Tie a rope in a chain
Make the pain go away
Maybe it's because I don't believe in you
But if you real I guess I'm gon' be seeing you
Take a easy ways out but I needed to
'cause if I wanna feel I gotta bleed, it's true

I'm so numb
I wanna feel feel again
I'm gon' jump
Want to puff blunts
So yeah I'm gon' slump
Smile through the day
Tonight I share blood
High with the angels
Need a new angle
I don't wanna stay, so
Wanna blow brains out
Wanna feel feel
I wanna feel real
I wanna feel kill

What's wrong with me, uh
What's wrong with me
