Hey, ladies?
Have you ever had to call one of these lil' hood rats?
And... and she tried to act like...
You don't know who the fuck your nigga is?
Man, these bitches done lost they mind, don't do that
Yeah, she gon' say somethin'

Listen, don't hit my line
Asking why my number in yo nigga shit (What?)
You wasting ya time (You just waitin' on me)
Probably shoulda asked that nigga bitch (I did)
Probably wouldn't fuck with that (Bitch you sound stupid)
Probably want a bad bitch in his life
I mean how the fuck am I suppose to know?
I mean you said that he was yo nigga right? (And you know that!)
Cuffing is dead
You heard what I said, bitch cuffing is dead
These new niggas don't know how to act
They in and out of everybody (No, bright-ass)
Never trust no nigga bitch
All these niggas counterfeit
Baby girl when you gon' learn?
That is not yo nigga, shit (Oh yeah you know what time it is)
These niggas for everybody (Nah not mine)
These niggas for everybody (Bitch you for everybody)
These niggas for everybody (You for everybody)
These niggas for everybody (You for everybody)
These niggas for everybody

I suck and fuck when I want to (Me too)
Run his pockets when I want (Bitch)
Run his check up at Saks and Fifth (That's it?)
That's what this good pussy do (It's whack)
Came through on dat late night
Sent fo' me first class flight (Commercial)
Follow me might learn something
Stop trippin' might earn somethin' (Ha ha ha)
He won't ever love a square bitch (A square bitch?)
Baby you gon' have to share him
Ya nigga been down with OPP
I hate to be the one to tell ya
I seen him in Houston with Lexis (I know her)
When he leave you he gon' text me (Uh-huh)
And I'ma ask him what that mouth do (But what yo mouth do?)
I can't help it that I'm this sexy
See you might be able to cuff some
But that nigga ain't gon' be none of 'em
See, that nigga love him a bad bitch (Which is me!)
And everybody havin' fun wit' him (That's why he wifed me)
See that nigga ain't no exclusive (Yes he is)
Girl, you out here looking stupid (Bitch, you look stupid)
I ain't being funny
I'm just telling you that you don't know what you doing (I wanna beat this bitch ass bro!)
The type of nigga you pursuing
Is the type that ain't gon' love you back (But he love me though)
He love what you do for him
But he know I ain't doin' none of that
See, he know I ain't having none of that
And I won't ever be his wifey (But you ain't got no choice)
Whenever you get out ya feelings bae
You might wanna do it just like me (Like you?)
See, me and my bitches don't save em (You a rat!)
We catch his ass and we throw it back
Break his ass down like a pound
When I'm done you can have him back (You proud of dat, huh?)
Bitch don't play yo self ain't nothing 'bout that nigga godly (That's mine)
He ain't just for you, baby, he for everybody
(Nah, no he ain't bitch, bitch, you for everybody) These niggas for everybody
(Bitch, but I done let you fuck along some little bad bitch you got beside yourself) These niggas for everybody
(Let me beat some motherfuckin' nerves up in that ass, where you at?) These niggas for everybody, these niggas for everybody
(Lil' weak bitch) These niggas for everybody

You say you'll never be his wifey
As if you ever had the option (What?)
The way dem titties sag
Milk that gon' bad bitch, I promise he ain't coppin' (Girl!)
Everybody know you boppin'
The whole hood know you fair play (And?!)
That little change that he throw yo way
Ho, I spend that shit everyday
Let me make some shit clear
I'm fuckin' off what you make in a year
You ride in Uber's, I ride in a Leer
We not cut from the same clothing, my dear (Yeah)
Talking that shit but bae must I remind you?
I am that bitch, I will pull up and find you (Pull up!)
Everything got my name on it (Yeah)
Ring finger got his rang on it
Don't nothing move 'til I sign shit
You might as well be my side bitch (Ha ha ha)
You probably wanna be quiet Miss
Cause I ain't never been tried, sis
That nigga don't even know you
No contact, no photos
Never seen 'em in the daylight
Do you know what the nigga really look like? (I don't care)
I mean wow,  thought you were winning 'til now?
Sonin' you bitch, you my child (Nah, you ain't my mom)
You living foul, you need to polish up bae
Basic shit I don't allow
And that nigga about to get his too
Just as soon as I'm done with you
'Cause them other niggas might be for everybody but
I'm who that motherfucker belong to (He for everybody)
So get it right bitch, I'm wife bitch
And can't nun of y'all hoes replace me
You proud to be this nigga cumrag?
Ho, you down bad and you crazy
Gon' knuckle up cause I'll fight for mines
Yo pussy petty, you wasting time
You seasonal, part time
You get fucked up fuckin' with mine you lil' bitch
