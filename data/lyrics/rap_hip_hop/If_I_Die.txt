Eyes low its from the potent, I just need some fuckin' closure
I’ll never forgive you for leaving me open never forget what you told me yea
Eyes low its from the potent, I just need some fuckin' closure
I'll never forgive you for leaving me open never forget what you told me aye
But it’s all okay but it's all okay (its all okay)
Said it's all okay said it's all okay (Said it's all okay)
But it's all okay but it's all okay (I it's all okay)
Said it’s all okay said it’s all okay

Uh Sayin' that it’s all okay
Sayin' that you love me but I know you don't
See the cut marks on your wrist speak and the bottles of patron
Feelin' empty on the low
Don’t wanna fall from the heavens gates
But that's over now bitch I fell from grace 'cause you know that I fucked up
You always sayin' that i'm not enough
I never ever wanna sober up 'cause I'm broken
You left my heart torn open
Won't you realize what you did to me
You was tellin' lies for my sympathy
Would you even care if I died
I might as well go ahead and try

I'll never forgive you for leaving me open never forget what you told me yea

But it's all okay but it's all okay (its all okay)
Said it's all okay said it's all okay (Said it's all okay)
But it's all okay but it's all okay (I it's all okay)
Said it's all okay said it's all okay
