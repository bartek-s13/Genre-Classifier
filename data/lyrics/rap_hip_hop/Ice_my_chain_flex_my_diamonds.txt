<<<<<<< HEAD
Everything that I got yeah, I went ,and got it I went and got it
Tryna to head towards the top all in perfect timing, all in perfect timing
Rich nigga with a knot, Imma flex my diamonds Imma flex my diamonds
Hell yeah Imma flex my diamonds, hell yeah Imma flex my diamonds
Everything that I got yeah, I went ,and got it I went and got it
Tryna to head towards the top all in perfect timing, all in perfect timing
Rich nigga with a knot, Imma flex my diamonds Imma flex my diamonds
Hell yeah Imma flex my diamonds, hell yeah Imma flex my diamonds

Flex up (aye) gotta get that check up
Flex up (aye) gotta get that check up
Flex up (aye) gotta get that check up
Flex up (aye) gotta get that check up
Secure a bag what Imma do today
Make the impossible, possible, hallucinate
Life a beach surf this money wave
Treat my stormy days like my sunny days
Take my lemons make lemonade
Let me enjoy my shade
BITCH
I remember days.. I had to defecate.. in the woods just like a stray
Thanking god I知 on to better days
Road to riches and I知 switching lanes
Ain't going back but I check the rearview look back at what I over came
Never forget I still bleed the pain... sacrificed just to make a change
Why not flex! Why not flex!  Why not go and ice my chain
Why not flex up! Why not ice my neck up
Why not flex up! Why not ice my neck up
Why not flex up when I got that check up
Why not flex up when I got that check up
Why not flex up if they ever doubted that you could
Why not flex up cop a whip and drop the hood
Middle fingers to everybodythat called me sewage
Fuck me over once then lil bitch you blew it
Get it fuck me over once then you lil bitch blew it
Gonna know my name if never knew it
That country boy jxhhny out the woods
That young boy he blest pay attention to him
Everything that I got yeah, I went ,and got it I went and got it
Tryna to head towards the top all in perfect timing, all in perfect timing
Rich nigga with a knot, Imma flex my diamonds Imma flex my diamonds
Hell yeah Imma flex my diamonds, hell yeah Imma flex my diamonds
Everything that I got yeah, I went ,and got it I went and got it
Tryna to head towards the top all in perfect timing, all in perfect timing
Rich nigga with a knot, Imma flex my diamonds Imma flex my diamonds
Hell yeah Imma flex my diamonds, hell yeah Imma flex my diamonds
Everything that i got ayee man it come from pain
Tired of losing out walking in the rain
Imma drip this sauce and imma ice my chain
Imma drip this sauce and imma ice my chain
Cop the crib , long as i live blow propane
Cop the crib , long as i live blow propane
Give my fam the world and show em better thangs
