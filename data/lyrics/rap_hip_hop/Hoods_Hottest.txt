OZ Records
P110
The Album, yeh
Brums House stand up
I'm the hood's hottest
I'm the hottest in my hood
You best believe me cos I'm not misunderstood
You're not a shotter not a thug
You're a proper little mug
Yeh I'm trying to start a fire
Catch me chopping up my wood
There's nothing popping in your hood
Man a shottin in your hood
If you want it I can get it
Yeh I got it from the blog
But I came up from the mud
I came up on some credit so good
I'd probably go back to college if I could
Fuck it, roll me up some bud though
Thinking bout nuff though
Sit back, bust dro
Who's behind the gunsmoke?
Now they round my nuts though
How come? Fuck knows
Probably cos respect don't cost shit I show the utmost
And so it gets shown back
Glad I got my own back
And if there's a profit to it
Then I probably sold that
I ain't trying to go back fam
Are you mad?
The music ting miss me
But I needed more stacks
So I had to go trap
Lucky I can rap
Now I'm counting money on my lap
You won't see me getting gassed
Lucky I can rap
Blowing up the fully on the map
Are you Mad?
I'm the hood's hottest
I'm the hottest in my hood
You best believe me cos I'm not misunderstood (Small Heath, yeh)
I'm the hood's hottest
I'm the hottest in my hood
You best believe me cos I'm not misunderstood
I told em bring me in some cannabis
Moving like my savages
Made your parents' salaries
Paid em for the damages
Putting on some calories
Man a eating good now
And if you fuckin mad at this
Then watch me put my foot down
Big size 11 don
Jog or fuckin pedal on
Now you see him, now you don't
You want him gone, I'll get him gone
Why you always taking long?
Different paths we're set upon
Never had a Dad so
Imma be a better one
So stop with all the death threats
Better place your next bets
Chilling playing FIFA probably listening to Remtrex
Can your face bench press?
Didn't think it could though
Done a hoods hottest, are you even in the hood though?
They ain't seen bud grow
Tryna cop the Hublot, tryna cop the Lambo
Shotting in a Punto
Wargwarn, Dun know, everything sho sho, ask me a photo
Better doing this than fucking running from the popo
Lucky I can rap
Now I'm counting money on my lap
You won't see me getting gassed
Lucky I can rap
Blowing up the fully on the map
Are you Mad?
I'm the hood's hottest
I'm the hottest in my hood
You best believe me cos I'm not misunderstood (Small Leaf, yeh)
I'm the hood's hottest
I'm the hottest in my hood
You best believe me cos I'm not misunderstood
Lucky I can rap
Now I'm counting money on my lap
You won't see me getting gassed
Lucky I can rap
Blowing up the fully on the map
Are you Mad?
I'm the hood's hottest
I'm the hottest in my hood
You best believe me cos I'm not misunderstood (Small Leaf, yeh)
I'm the hood's hottest
I'm the hottest in my hood
You best believe me cos I'm not misunderstood
