Under my tree this Christmas
Ooh whoa, whoa, whoa
(Ear drummers)
Whoa, whoa

I didn't have you under my tree this Christmas
But I had you all over my wish list
Oh oh oh, whoa
You're not under my mistletoe
I didn't have you under my tree this Christmas
But I had you all over my wish list
Oh oh oh, whoa
You're not under my mistletoe
Oh oh oh, whoa
The weather outside is cold

I was standing by the fire
Thinking I should write her
Doves cry from a songbird
Skipping heartbeats, it's my turn
Light a candle, wish you were here
What a way to start the new year
Disappear into my nightmare
I expected you to stay there
You're the only star that I see
Gone, gone, where you hiding?
Oh baby, were you lonely?
Don't leave a nigga tearing
Wipe the eyes if you crying
Holiday's been quiet
Holiday's pretty quiet

I didn't have you under my tree this Christmas
But I had you all over my wish list
Oh oh oh, whoa
You're not under my mistletoe
Oh oh oh, whoa
The weather outside is cold (Cold)

All on my own, don't remind
I need recovery time
I'm losing you and I'm fine
Eggnog, I switch to the wine
First I was waiting on E
Never thought I'd see the day you would leave
Stop by, I need a relief
Stop by, I'm in disbelief
I gave you the world
Lord knows I tried
Lord knows that I tried
Lord knows I tried
I didn't see you when I opened up my eyes
When I opened up my eyes

I didn't have you under my tree this Christmas
But I had you all over my wish list
Oh oh oh, whoa
You're not under my mistletoe
Oh oh oh, whoa
The weather outside is cold
It's cold, cold
The weather outside is cold
