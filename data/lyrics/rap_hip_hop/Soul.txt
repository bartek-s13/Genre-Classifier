<<<<<<< HEAD
This is for my seven day a week, always on they grind niggas
Sacrifice it all just so we can shine niggas
Takin' care of their kids on that 9 to 5 nigga
I made this here for you 'cause you all my niggas
Now I don't stress over these hoes
I obsess over these flows
I may as well be Messi 'cause I got so many goals
And I gotta reach 'em all like I'm Ash Ketchum
Cause in this life you get one shot and this my last second
Now watch me pass go, get my dough, break my daddy out of jail
Buy my mama a new house, somewhere in the Berkeley Hills
Take my niggas 'cross the world then come back and pay my bills
Level up on everybody and remain real

See don't let 'em take your soul, take your soul, got damn
Better fight it and don't let 'em make you fold, got damn
Break the mold got damn, break the mold, got damn
Don't let 'em take your soul, take your soul, got damn
Said don't let 'em take your soul, I said don't let 'em take your soul, god damn
I said don't let 'em take your soul, I said don't let em

This is for my day one, ride or die, free the ankle niggas
Used to have to spam and eat cup noodles for dinner
Hit my mama house to do my laundry in the winter
Still on my auntie couch but I'm gonna get out in a minute
We was on that block tryna make a way, make a way out
Granny died, had to tell mama "it's okay now"
What you know about no lights and water at 16
And no car to drive when you got a girl, but you chasing a dream
And you grown as fuck and they tell you to get a job and quit playing
And your bank account is so immature 'cause that shit ain't got no sense
And every nigga 'round your city hate on you just for being yourself
But you can't stop and you won't stop, you just tighten up your belt
But you can't stop and won't stop, you just tighten up your belt

See don't let 'em take your soul, take your soul, got damn
Better fight it and don't let 'em make you fold, got damn
Break the mold got damn, break the mold, got damn
Don't let 'em take your soul, take your soul, got damn
Said don't let 'em take your soul, I said don't let 'em take your soul, god damn
