We've all got our demons
But mine are the meanest
They won't let me get to close
To the one's i need the most
They angry and violent
They show up univited
So you better run away
For my demons come to play

Got me in my feelings for the last time
I gave you my heart but you ain't see the shine
Come to think about it, you was never really mine
I used to tell you everything that came up in my mind
And you couldn't keep it real with me when you had the time
And all the lies i can recite every single line
I kept it real no matter how you would've feel about it
And all this love you told me you couldn't live without it
You was my sunshine now my days is getting clouded
And all these demons in my visions, I won't speak about it
Middle finger to 'em tell them get the fuck about it
'Cause i ain't playin' games you won't wanna be about it
Yeah ay, Yeah ay
Demons reaching for me
Yeah ay, I'ma keep on going
Yeah ay, I'ma keep on going
We've all got our demons
But mine are the meanest
They won't let me get to close
To the one's i need the most
They angry and violent
They show up univited
So you better run away
For my demons come to play

Yo yo
I got i got hella demons runin' through my veins
I gave you my love and all you did was give me pain
Remember when you told me you would never ever change
So why you throw me in the dirt and leave me in the flames
I would've died for you and give you everything
And if you needed me you know that i would've came
Could'a gave you a diamond ring
But you was never 'bout me you was only 'bout the game
I don't wanna hear it see all you tell is lies
You tell me that you love me when you look me in the eyes
But then you turn around and started fuckin' other guys
And it's not the first time so i'm really not surprised
But im'a make you learn since you wanna play with fire
Im'a make it burn
Im'a make it burn
We've all got our demons
(We all got demons)
But mine are the meanest
(mine are the meanest)
Yeah yeah
They won't let me get to close
To the one's i need the most
They angry and violent
(They angry and violent)
They show up univited
So you better run away
For my demons come to play
Ay

We've all got our demons
But mine are the meanest
They won't let me get to close
To the one's i need the most
They angry and violent
They show up univited

So you better run away
For my demons come to play
