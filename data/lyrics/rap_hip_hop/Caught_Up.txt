I think I can do this all in one take
Yeah

Yeah, yeah
I'm caught up in these feelings that I got
Just went to see my pops
In the ATL like Rashad
Came back with a new new view on how I see you
And how I see myself, I'm not the same bitch, I grew
A few big checks, a few gold chains
Would really help a young nigga find peace inside his brain
I know that I'm gon' shine, so I find peace beside the rain
I know I got a couple problems on my father I could blame
But I'm not gon' play that game
Just leave me out the lineup
I leave our problems where I leave the police (behind us)
Realize that I don't do this shit for retweets or dollars
I'm just a byproduct of the pain I keep inside of
My mind is always racing, but they ain't no fucking driver
My heart is more cold than a pimp to a client
'cause I am not perfect, unlike God's timing
I wanna do better, and I'm tryin'
I'm caught up
Yeah, I'm caught up
I'm caught up
Yeah
I'm caught up
Caught up
Yeah, yeah
I'm caught up

Verse 2, yeah
I'm caught up in these feelings that I got for my ex-bitch
Send you a text, get no reply, but see you flexin'
I know I'm 'posed to be all hard and never sweat shit
But it hurt when you lose the one that you connect with
I told you I was going through some real-real ass shit
And no, this is not about the relationship or you bein' my chick
Please just hit my phone so we can talk when time permits
3 days went by, I never heard from you
I know I hurt you when I broke up with you, but that's beside the point
I think I might've lost my mind, I know its not inside these joints
You be the one to help me find it when I'm deep inside you
Look into your eyes, you say you love me, but I know you lied to me
And when I snuck you in my aunt's at late at night, you cried to me
All the weekends you left Sac', got in your car to drive to me
I didn't care about your past as long as you was right to me
Now I can't even get you to write to me
I'm caught up
I'm caught up
I'm caught up
I'm caught up
