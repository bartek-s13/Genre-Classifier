Ayy, yo, Jaasu, this a hit
Take a look at my lifestyle right now, a lot for me to lose
Got a lot for me to prove

Take a look at my lifestyle right now, a lot for me to lose
Ain't always in the right like right now, a lot for me to prove
Say you love me, but you hate me at the same time (Same time)
Said I like you, but you told me that you ain’t mine (Nah)
Take a look at my lifestyle right now, a lot for me to lose

You say you don't know me anymore (More)
What we fighting for? (For)
I thought you were tripping when you asked me
"Do you even love me anymore?" (More)
Now I do not know (Know)
'Cause you been acting different since the last week
No time to fight now (No)
Barely got time for me
Can’t afford to lose right now
I'm just chasing my dreams
Ups and downs, get me off this rollercoaster
You can't see that I love you even if I told you
Take a look at my lifestyle right now, a lot for me to lose
Ain't always in the right like right now, a lot for me to prove
Say you love me, but you hate me at the same time (Same time)
Said I like you, but you told me that you ain't mine (Nah)
Take a look at my lifestyle right now, a lot for me to lose

When it all falls apart in the dark
Who you coming crying to?
If you are who you say who you are
You would know I'm trying to

Take a look at my lifestyle right now, a lot for me to lose
Ain't always in the right like right now, a lot for me to prove

Take a look at my lifestyle right now, a lot for me to lose
Ain't always in the right like right now, a lot for me to prove
Say you love me, but you hate me at the same time (Same time)
Said I like you, but you told me that you ain’t mine (Nah)
Take a look at my lifestyle right now, a lot for me to lose (Lot for me to lose)
