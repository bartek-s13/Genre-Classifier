<<<<<<< HEAD
I'm just tryna make it out and get the money for my family, why they hate me? Yeah
Young and I done came up out of nothin', I'm a Metro Housing baby, yeah
Hustling them hundreds, I been stackin', 'cause the life we livin' crazy, yeah
Stuck up in the trenches, 'member prayin' to the Lord, come and save me, yeah
Left the stu', was on it, gotta know when I crashed that Mercedes
Been a savior through the fakes, now I'm ridin' in the Wraith
Pull up tonight
I might just pull up tonight (I might just pull up)
Pull up tonight
