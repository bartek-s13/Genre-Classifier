A couple quarters in my pocket
A few dollars in my wallet
I've been doing well
I've been working overtime
Couple cars in my garage
Can you see me now
Haven't heard from you in months
I wonder what you're running from
Can we talk it out
And at night I go to bed
I see the reaper in my head
Won't you kill me now
Seeing through these curtains
Spending too much time in my bed
Only thing I know now
I've got too much time on my hands
You've got too much blood on yours
You got what you asked for, yeah

Time to grow up, get a real job
5:35 at the bus stop
Heard they got benefits, and it's evident
That you got what it takes to get to the top
Know you been going through things
But you can feel better when the money comes in
And every night you can question your life
While you stare at the ceiling
No fucking feelings
Bringin it bringin it back to the good ol' days
To the run down park where we used to skate
Paul and Connor John Bert and Lopez
Not one day did I feel this hopeless (god damn)
And they try to get me to go to therapy, please
No human alive could revive my mind
Would you think it's a lie
If I said I was fine
A couple quarters in my pocket
A few dollars in my wallet
I've been doing well
I've been working overtime
Couple cars in my garage
Can you see me now
Haven't heard from you in months
I wonder what you're running from
Can we talk it out
And at night I go to bed
I see the reaper in my head
Won't you kill me now

Swear to god I've been trying
I've been just finding
All of the things that I keep in my mind
But I can't even write them
Let alone say it
I'm losing my mind while I'm losing my patience
At the end of the day I'm amazed
At the pain you'll sustain for a paycheck
So it's back to the basics
I'm picturing life when the music don't pay
In an all black Acura
Got the kids in the back and the wife in the passenger
Man I've been spectacular
Got my own office and a gun in the cabinet
See I'm thinkin' about blasting it
Leave a stain on the wall near the frame of my bachelor's
