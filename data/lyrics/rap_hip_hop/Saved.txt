Screwed up and broke down
I never wanted to
Sat still and lost it all
I never left my chair
They're just the same walls
And things around us change
I'm saying what's gotta be said
And there's no other way
Cold feet, I don't wanna be scared
I can only save myself
I thought the new you
Could fix the other one
Not gonna wait for proof
When you're under the gun
They're just the same rules
And things around us change
I'm saying what's gotta be said
And there's no other way
Cold feet, I don't wanna be scared
I can only save myself
Moving unsteadily
We never aim to please
It's not so challenging
With everything you need
You look way down
No color in your face
Sit down and talk it out
Until we feel the sting
They're just the same rules
And things around us change
