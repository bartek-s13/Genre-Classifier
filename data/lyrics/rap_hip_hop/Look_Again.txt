Lyrics from Snippets

Music doesn't come from your mind
It comes from your soul
Mm, mm, mm-mm, mm

Oh, oh, oh
I serve my time for all my crimes
Standing here feeling so terrified
And no one knows where the answer lies
How you gon' tell me what I gotta live without?
When you know half the things that I live without
I highly doubt, that you have the same things holding you down

This is me telling you, you would never understand
This is what they see from the outside, lookin' in
Unexplainable, unexplainable
Unexplainable, even if you look again
Even if you look again
Even if you look again (Yeah)
Even if you look again (Oh, oh)

In the back of my head, there's something haunting
And no one wants me, to end up lonely
I'm searching for my peace, somebody help me
Feels like I'm about to-

Thinkin' 'bout what I should've said
Girl I wanna show it to you
Damn, my room ain't nothing but these walls
Show me something I can't control
Demons taking over my soul
I can feel it
I can feel it
I can feel it
I can

This is me telling you, you would never understand
This is what they see from the outside, lookin' in
Unexplainable, unexplainable
Unexplainable, even if you look again
Even if you look again
Even if you look again (Yeah)
Even if you look again (Oh, oh)
