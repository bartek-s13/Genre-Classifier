Hook:
I’m where the cheddar be, where the cheddar be
Out in Tel Aviv, out in Tel Aviv
Keep it hella G, like it’s ten a piece
Got the henessy, don’t got the time fuck you telling me
I’m where the cheddar be, where the cheddar be
Out in Tel Aviv, out in Tel Aviv
Keep it hella G, like it’s ten a piece
Got the henessy, don’t got the time fuck you telling me
Verse 1:
In love with the hustle I aim for my goals
Tryna have em get a taste of my flow
See this the lane that I chose
Apparently, I gotta chase what I know
Cool with the music entertaining my soul
And I’m just tryna get me hella bands
If I don’t make it I just hope I get a second chance
This music shit I swear it got me feeling hella stressed
Like I don’t even feel my head attached
An L is something that I can’t accept
I’m outta state but I just tell em send a beat and I’m ready
Past due but fuck it I’m dropping this heat that I carry
Keep me a semi, that’s tucked between the seats of the chevy
Getting hella faded sipping Hennessy to the belly ugh
Got no time to beat around so I just tell it straight
I had a taste, now it’s only cheddar I tend to chase
I’ll put in overtime this year to set the record straight
Kept the faith, tired of holding memories I can’t erase
Meditate just so my mind is at peace
Numbers growing I been focused on expanding my reach
Styling on em with the way I’m dripping down to my sneaks
I ain’t never asking for nothing I got what I need
Hook:
I’m where the cheddar be, where the cheddar be

Out in Tel Aviv, out in Tel Aviv
Keep it hella G, like it’s ten a piece
Got the henessy, don’t got the time fuck you telling me
Verse 2:
Came in the game
Seen a lotta records that I’m aiming to break
I look up to the legends that been paving the way
You got something to say just cut straight to the chase
Couldn’t imagine if I never tried
Had to fall in love with the music when I felt the vibe
The passion inside is something that I can’t describe
Got me spilling a lot of feelings that I tend to hide
From now it’s no brakes, I got my foot on the pedal
Had to take a lotta risks and never choosing to settle
Tired of making an excuse had to move it aside
I don’t got an option everyday I’m choosing to grind
Calculated with every move, I’m making I gotta be
The illest up on these beats
A youngin chasing a dream
No what ifs I had to try
Like fuck it I gotta fly
The passion up in my eyes
They never stalling my drive
Hook:
I’m where the cheddar be, where the cheddar be
