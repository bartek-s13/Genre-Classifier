When you were worrying about pissing on your fuckin' self, I was a stoner
Bang gang
Dun Deal on the tra-tra-tra-track
Way back in 90-fucking'-4 when I was six or seven...
Ayy, ayy, this that stoner music, nigga

I just put 10,000 on my bitch just like a boss
I just drank with YSL just like a f****** boss
Just like a f****** boss, just like a boss, boss

Run that money up, like ya 'bout to start trial
When you beat the case, turn into a stoner child
We don't stand in line, foreign shoes hurt your feet
Everybody stoned, weed, lean, molly, E (Whoo)
Every time I walk inside the club I see everybody looking
You know I'm a stoner, I love drugs and I can't never be tooken
And you can suck my banana, but I won't eat your pudding
So come a lil' closer, my bitch won't know ya
Andalé andalé andalé, andalé andalé andalé
How the fuck a nigga think he gone survive on a YSL runway
(How fool?)
My glasses are metro no blood off your chest
I control ya ho like Net-and-flix
Your bitch is my dinner she wet like a fish
I took off her three legs, T-Rex
