(Chorus)
My name is lucid
Yea my name is lucid
L-U-C-I-D D D
No body stopping me
I'm a machine
So I know that I won't stop until I'm in the scene (x2)
(Verse 1)
You think you can rap boy?
Well, you fucking slack boy
50 views on my last song what you call that boy?
Nah but I'm just slaying em
All my rhymes I'm laying em
All emcees I fucking eat we call that buffeting em!
But I'm just messing dude
I'll teach you a lesson dude
To the top I'm heading dude
All these raps we wreck em dude
[On the real though
We call this the real flow
If you fuck with me you must best bet that you a real hoe (x3)] x2
(Chorus) x2
(Verse 2)
From the womb to the tomb yea we be killing it
If you try to gulp my flow, you ain't even sippin it
Got my mind racing cuz the beats that I be swimming in
I just go to school and then the studio I'm hitting it
Soundcloud I'm giving this
My futures looking millions
I'm the villain that be winning y'all like the civilian
Saturday I'm kicking it
Microphone I'm ripping it
Not green but I can trip a bit
Not tricks but I can spin a bit
Hope ya homies digging this
Coming through I spit a bit
Rap game I'm tipping it but ain't
No body topping it
Yea nobody stopping it
Yea I'm fucking rocking it
Then watching it go higher in society I'm calling it
(Chorus) x3
