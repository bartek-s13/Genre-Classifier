Yeah, yeah, yeah
Count up a whole lot of (yeah)
I got a whole lot of (yeah)
I count a whole lotof  (yeah)
Chaz Guapo

Count up a whole lot of blue strips
New money, who this?
So many racks on a nigga
I don't know what to do with it
So many packs on nigga
Swearin' sometimes I get paranoid
Lifestyle that you can't afford
Since a jit, I always wanted more

Hopped off the porch on a money mission
In these streets I go tunnel vision
They ain't think I'll make it this far
Remember days me and Tish talked
69-12 gave mama hell
Posted on the curb tryna catch a sale
Me and you can't relate, 'cause me and you not the same
I took an O, I put it all on the line and threw the letters in the chain
Any weaker, got the gang with me, gray flags, count up big bags
I gave my hood motivation, and took it all across the nation
They ask me who I think I am, first of all, I'm the man
Double G on the slippers, Balmain with the zippers
Never get tired of ballin', told all my niggas we all in
Making money while she calling, choose the money over bitches
'Cause once you got it, she gon' want you with it
Got rich, did it independent
Count up a whole lot of blue strips
New money, who this?
So many racks on a nigga
I don't know what to do with it
So many packs on nigga
Swearin' sometimes I get paranoid
Lifestyle that you can't afford
Since a jit, I always wanted more

I flew to Cali, had to get it cheaper
Twenty or more, I can ship 'em to you
Niggas talkin' all this plug talk
I'm making racks while they sleeping (for real)
If I'm not booked, then I'm leaving (I'm gone)
I'm only in town for the season (nah, for real)
I'm not in town for no reason
Thirty on me like I'm Stephen, red bottoms when I step in
We the ones get 'em in, trap 'em out (yeah)
Press your luck, forty hit 'em up, wipe 'em out
They ain't never wanna slide, now they all wanna go
Picture me riding high, but I'm trying to stay low
Three grams in the Backwood, smoke a zip every hour
Out the P, blowing sour, told my brother world is ours
Perfect time on the Rollie, presidential members only
Made a million with the homies, made a million with homies
Count up a whole lot of blue strips
New money, who this?
So many racks on a nigga
I don't know what to do with it
So many packs on nigga
Swearin' sometimes I get paranoid
Lifestyle that you can't afford
Since a jit, I always wanted more
Count up a whole lot of blue strips
New money, who this?
So many racks on a nigga
I don't know what to do with it
So many packs on nigga
Swearin' sometimes I get paranoid
Lifestyle that you can't afford
Since a jit, I always wanted more
