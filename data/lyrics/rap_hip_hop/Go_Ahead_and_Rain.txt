I don't know how you go on with your sorrows
Weighing you down like a stone
But then I don't know how I can sit there
And give you advice dying for home
You could be the girl I'm searching for
But I hardly know your name
Ooh, why don't you love me anyway
Won't you do what your little heart's tryin' to say
Baby go ahead and rain on me
See I don't know why we keep standing around here like
Little boy lost and his girl
But you won't let me in and I can't say goodnight
And just drive away my world
?Cause you're the face I will always see
When I close my eyes and dream
Ooh, why don't you love me anyway
Won't you do what your little heart's tryin' to say
Baby, go ahead and rain on me
Go ahead and rain
Oh, you can go ahead and rain, rain, rain on me
You know this old world would keep spinning around
Without a lucky guy like me
But please won't you love me anyway
Go ahead and do what you little heart's trying to say
Baby, go ahead and rain
?Cause maybe things will never be the same again
Baby, go ahead and rain on me
Go ahead and rain
