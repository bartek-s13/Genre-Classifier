<<<<<<< HEAD
I can hear that money callin' on me (Yeah, yeah)
I'm with you and it's like quarter to three (Yeah)
I wonder how you fit it all in them jeans (Yeah, yeah)
I hit it right, now you fallin' for me
My favourite outfit, when you naked (Naked)
Money chase, man, we never chase it (No)
Diamonds-diamonds in the club, straight aceing
We gon'-we gon' take shots of the Henny till we faded (Yeah)
Call me, ca-ca-call me your baby, I love your sex in the mornin'
All of-all of this money will have you flexin' and ballin' (Yeah, yeah)
You know them haters stay watchin' when you walk in (Ooh)
Cah we some VIP, very important (Let's go)
Middle of Summer but my ice stay frozen
Da-dancing on me you got my mind going romance
I'm tryna leave with you, baby, you stallin'
Give you this good, good love but don't be falling

Give you this good, good love and now we fallin'
She fell for ah rude boy and now she's out there callin'
Give you this good, good love and now we fallin'
She fell for ah rude boy and now she still callin'

I wanna give you some good, good lovin'
I wanna give you a hot, hot fuckin'
You gotta shake it, you gotta break it
Wine on her waist like shawty's Jamaican
Hmm, it's 2AM in the mornin'
Shots of the vodka, Hennessy and we goin' in
Drunk text and she's gwanin', ease on it
Know you got a man but brrr, she's calling
Lightskin tanned in Ibiza
Jet flying, you don't need to land with a visa
You gon' let me slice like a pie made pizza
When I get inside I don't damage it either (Yeah, yeah)
Go ahead and dance for me darlin'
And when you dance you go all in
You almost had me fallin'
And I'm ah rude boy and you still callin'

Give you this good, good love and now we fallin'
She fell for ah rude boy and now she's out there callin'
Give you this good, good love and now we fallin'
She fell for ah rude boy and now she still callin'

I can hear that money calling on me
I'm with you and it's like quarter to three
I can hear that money calling on me
I'm with you and it's like quarter to three (Let's go)
