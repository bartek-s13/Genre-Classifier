I thought
That I was the one
For you
You don’t wanna go
But you must
And I’ll stay
Here
Oh, you don’t have to go…

I get up and I look to my side
And I know that I said I’m alright
And I am, most the time, but at night
Oh I feel so alone
I feel so alone
Get up and I look to my side
And I look a new girl in her eyes
And I know that we had a good time
But I feel so alone
I feel so alone

I could give a million reasons why I ain’t been around but
Found the truth much easier no matter how it sound I
Need to find myself, but I keep finding her
In all emotions felt, in every written word
It was bitter for too long to think this sweet
A hope for love is something in my life I really need
As I breathe in I hope achievement will help me wake
But I’ll go back to sleep and triple Z until I find
Something great for Jack to be

I get up and I look to my side
And I know that I said I’m alright
And I am, most the time, but at night
Oh I feel so alone
I feel so alone
Get up and I look to my side
And I look a new girl in her eyes
And I know that we had a good time
But I feel so alone
I feel so alone

Look I’m sorry I been distant
Whatever you think that it is, it isn’t
I’ve been on a mission:
Either fixin’ what’s wrong with me - so I can live again
Or succeeding so hard it affirms every decision I’ve made
Every path taken
Every relationship hurt
Every hour spent choking on my own words
Just so I could be a rockstar or keep rapping
But, ugh
Maybe that’s why I’m not happy

I get up and I look to my side
And I know that I said I’m alright
And I am, most the time, but at night
Oh I feel so alone
I feel so alone
Get up and I look to my side
And I look a new girl in her eyes
And I know that we had a good time
But I feel so alone
I feel so alone


No
I ain’t giving up
I’ve always been an optimist, there’s
Just a lot of people I need to be honest with and
I just wanted to explain where I’ve been at:
Goin’ over Ex’s and plotting O’s like it’s Tic-Tac-Toe
Yo, so
Uh
I’m moving on, I’m moving on, here I go
Yeah
‘Today’s the day’, I keep on saying, but don’t know
Dang
I ain’t even looking for love, just some hope but
Until then, sing your song
I’ll sing what’s me
And hope someone out there will sing with me
Yeah
I just hope someone out there will sing with me

Yeah I thought
That I was the one
Confused
