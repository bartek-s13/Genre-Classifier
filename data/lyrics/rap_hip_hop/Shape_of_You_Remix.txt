You know mi love when you get nasty
I wanna do you in the back seat
Never put no man above me
Seven days sex, I'ma leave you so weak
Like hol' up, hol' up
I'ma go slower, slower
Tell the chauffeur, chauffeur
Keep your eyes up on the road, cuz, the road, cuz
So her cake when you doing the work, love how you wine too
Neck back, gripping your hair, working your spine too
Gentleman, I let you come first, and then I come through
Nine lives, killed the whole nine, a nigga ate who

Rude boy, mi nuh beg friend
Big black hand ting, it ah end them
These niggas all pussies, baby
I'm the only nigga that drive that pussy crazy
'Cause I love the shape of you, mama
I wanna put my hands on ya
She know I'm tryna open her
Body like a bottle, Coca-Cola
Cause I love the shape of you, mama
I wanna put my hands on ya
She know I'm tryna open her
Body like a bottle, Coca-Cola

Every day discovering something brand new

She said mi talking too much, mi talking too much
I should come her way
She said mi want it too much, mi want it too much
(Just a likkle bit mi want)
Come grind pon it, don't get offended
There's enough for you, girl, and your best friend
Mi know you want it, stop pretending
In the back of the rave or in a basement
Any place that you name, girl, we can go
If you're feeling my vibe
We could disappear to a place
That's out of sight
Just you and I-I-I
And we'll be fi-i-ine
Just you and I-I-I
And we'll be fi-i-ine, fi-i-ine

Rude boy, mi nuh beg friend
Big black hand ting, it ah end them

'Cause I love the shape of you, mama
I wanna put my hands on ya
She know I'm tryna open her
Body like a bottle, Coca-Cola
Cause I love the shape of you, mama
I wanna put my hands on ya
She know I'm tryna open her
Body like a bottle, Coca-Cola
