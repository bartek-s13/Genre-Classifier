All we do is drive
All we do is think about the feelings that we hide
All we do is sit in silence waiting for a sign
Sick and full of pride
All we do is drive
And California never felt like home to me
And California never felt like home
And California never felt like home to me
Until I had you on the open road and now we're singing

The weathers changing
But it feels the same
The tables turning
But tell me who gets the blame
Some say it'll never rain
Some say they won't complain
Some say they'll never change until they feel the empty pain
Of being somebody that's left in the dark
Looking around seeing nobody there
Some people tell you they never would leave
Until you realize that they all disappear
And they told you them lies, told you to sleep
Told you that they'll be right back in a week
But never they came and now that you see
That people just talk and just talk and repeat
You looking for love, looking for hope
Looking for anything that you could scope
Looking for happiness up in a soap
And honestly you just don't know where to go

But you just keep moving and moving and hoping
That one day you truly will know it
And the emotion that you have you'll never show it
Seems like all we do is

Drive
All we do is think about the feelings that we hide
All we do is sit in silence waiting for a sign
Sick and full of pride
All we do is drive
And California never felt like home to me
And California never felt like home
And California never felt like home to me
Until I had you on the open road and now we're singing

Gave you my soul
Gave you my heart
Told you no matter what we'll never be apart
Seems like everybody wanna finish way before they even start
Why every time somebody's wrong I always get the fault
But that's how it is when you swim with the sharks
And you just get deep in the ocean
And you just keep hearing these noises
But you don't know what's the commotion
And all you just wanted was effort
But they would just give you a portion
You're life just keep getting dryer
And all you just needed was lotion
And now you just all in your mind
How do I see when I feel like that I'm blind
Give me a ladder, I still wouldn't climb
This is a life that I didn't design

And now I'm just moving and moving and hoping one day that I know it
And the feeling that I have I'll never show it
Seems like all we do is

Drive
All we do is think about the feelings that we hide
All we do is sit in silence waiting for a sign
Sick and full of pride
All we do is drive
And California never felt like home to me
And California never felt like home
And California never felt like home to me
Until I had you on the open road and now we're singing

Wrapped around your stick shift
Swerving on the 405
I can never keep my eyes off this
My neck, the feeling of your soft lips
Illuminated in the light
Bouncing off the exit signs I missed
