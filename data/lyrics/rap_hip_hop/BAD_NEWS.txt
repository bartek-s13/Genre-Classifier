Blacked out, how'd the other night last?
Maybe come around for a minute, shit, I like that
I could never catch, taking aim, might've missed you
Couple hundred miles out, if I hear the text, mm
Know you're probably

Blacked out, get the bag now
Where the address, where's he at now?
Don't let me back there

And all of my demons in bed, what you call it?
I left all of my demons on read, not a problem, mm
