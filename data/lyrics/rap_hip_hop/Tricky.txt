It's getting tricky in my city, truth is that you niggas ain't fuckin' with me
I see these niggas staring when a nigga pop out but they don't say nothing to me
You see my shoes they Loub' or Gucc', remember you bitches was fronting on me
Dare you to run up, better move or boom, you niggas ain't taking nothing from me

I waited my turn, now I think it's my time that I put my city in a chokehold 
Them niggas sneak diss on my name, then ask me for features 'cause they don't want no smoke
I know that my niggas is comin', you know that they comin', my nigga, it's no joke
We ain't playin those games, it's no joke
I know that you niggas don't want smoke
I got a snake on my sneaker, I'm making more money than my teacher
It's game time, screamin', "We gon' ball," remember I sat up on the bleachers
Wherever I go they screaming my name and playing my tunes on the speakers
Fuck all of them bitches who curved and got on my nerves, now all of them some eaters

My niggas gon' run it up, we gon' fuck it up, focused up on the dollars
If you get in the way of that paper my niggas gon' run in your crib to your mama
We be checked up like a Taliban, my niggas, they move like Osama
They stole the drip, they stole the sauce, run in the store, I don't care what it cost
I turned myself to a motherfucking boss

We gettin' that shit that we couldn't afford, yeah, yeah yeah
