Yeah, Papi, uh

Seeing you with this new nigga hurts
Look how quickly you replaced me
The one you told me not to worry about
Drives me crazy
Cuts when I see you callin' these other niggas "baby"
Sayin' all of the same cute things you used to say to me
No matter how hard I try
Still feel you in my conscience
Filling myself with liquor
My feelings for you are constant
Lately at night, I've been reminiscing
Girl you changed
I know it sounds lame but my feelings are still the same
And I've been drinking
Here's to the old ways
Missing you girl forever
Here's to the old days
Times that we spent together
My life flew upside down for me
Handstand
I put my heart in these lyrics nigga
Transplant
Where's your heart? Where's your feelings? (I don't know)
Got this feelin' in my chest, won't go (Won't go)
And I'm hoping that karma's gonna make you pay for this
Loyal to your streaks but ain't loyal to a relationship
