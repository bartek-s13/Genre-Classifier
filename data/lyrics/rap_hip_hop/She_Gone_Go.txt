Haha, DMBeezy
Trill Ryan on the beat, yo
Exit
(K-Wop mixed it)

She gon' go on the sound of my whistle
While she grippin' on my pistol
She gon' fuck tonight, dismiss her, her, her
She gon' go on the sound of my whistle
While she grippin' on my pistol
She gon' fuck tonight, dismiss her, her, her

I need a bad bitch that's real nasty
The type to fuck your homies, but she classy
The type to suck your dick without asking
I like a bitch that pull up and get to action, yeah, yeah
We don't play, yeah, yeah
We shoot to spray, yeah, yeah
We don't play, play
I don't want no girlfriend
But I think I'm feelin' you
And I know you feelin' me (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
You gon' be alright, no one's fuckin' with me
I don't want no girlfriend
But I think I'm feelin' you
And I know you' feelin' me
You gon' be alright, no one's fuckin' with me

She gon' go on the sound of my whistle
While she grippin' on my pistol
She gon' fuck tonight, dismiss her, her, her
She gon' go on the sound of my whistle
While she grippin' on my pistol
She gon' fuck tonight, dismiss her, her, her

Mask come out quick, backdoor, pop shit
City, I'm the locksmith, you niggas in my shit
Bands on my kicks, they know me up in Saks Fifth
Got Gotti on the tracklist, too easy with this rap shit
I ate behind bars, but now bars how I'm eatin'
Beatin' out the work when you didn't starve with your people
I don't know why they put two hundred on the dash, I'm a demon
It go down when everybody 'round you ride for no reason, ayy
We be on that gutter shit, plot twist, they lovin' it
Ain't worried 'bout that other bitch 'cause I be with my other bitch
You sleepin', don't want none of this, want beef? Get the oven mitt
Codeine, get to snubbin' shit, whole team get a fumble in, ayy
Halloween, you think it's Purge the way my mask on
Leave a nigga brown and dirty like a bad thong
They like, "How you turn to rap? You ain't gon' last long"
A hundred grams my neck, but I made it off my last song

She gon' go on the sound of my whistle

She gon' go on the sound of my whistle
While she grippin' on my pistol
