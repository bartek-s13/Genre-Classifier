Six pack a Oberon show me my pagoda
Them Division 1 college days we ate that bologna
Shit was all good dem chicks would chop wood
And they had it understood the walk-of-shame was the cost
The shit I used to do, be ashamed of these broads
They prolly got two or three kids right now

Mini-van soccer Mom always swervin’ wit a smile
She knew me way back when

Pittsburgh where I did show me where the ceilings
I didn’t do it on my own
Ray Dawn had a 6-pack a Oberon
College days were bomb

What’s a four-leaf clover when you buy a Rover cash
Hit the fast lane lames gonna get passed
Yeah ye out the crew forgive yaself thus life won’t last
We all got a day with the reaper that’s a fact
When I see him believe I’ma high-five him and share a laugh

Feel grateful that you got the chance to change my Pampers
Your ignorance took for granted
Thrown away easy cause your ass never planned it
