Now tell me how you feel
I just smoke a L you pop a pill
50 racks I gotta get them bills
You said that I won't do it but I will
Always gotta watch out for the family
But when I fuck it up they cannot stand me
They still got my back just like some plan B
I知 everything they want I知 what you can't be
Still that money callin on the celly
I don稚 listen ain稚 shit you could tell me
Making money moves I gotta go go
I got Bitcoin and I copped it for the low low
And I dont date a bitch to pay her bills no
Love me but you gotta keep it chill
I ain't tryna to fight your love but baby it could kill
Keep this shit 100 cuz I gotta keep it real
I知 only 23 already seen my first mil
Riding in a benz
I can't hit that bitch unless she is a 10
I ain't worried boutcha itty bitty, bands
I might fuck your bitch a little bitty, damn
Ay ay
I wanna hit it on repeat
Ay ay
Hit till we sleepy
Everybody keep hatin
Wanna be me
I知 so powerful my energy is seeping
Girl you look amazing no more makeup or we gon be late
Bitches love to hate gotta let it dissipate
I could spot a fake bitch from a mile away
Then I fly away, lucid when I lie awake
She sick of life and she lookin for a way out
A lil money turn the world to ya playground
We can keep spending like it's nothing cuz I知 paid now
On my way now I can never stay down
Cool
Custom fit it if I gotta rock it look cool
No diamond chain to flood it up I dip in my pool
I could have so many bad bitches can't choose
And I got so many damn wins I can't lose
You won't catch me cheatin I'm the realest in the game
You can never stop me I put that on my name
Every time I'm in the spot they know it might rain
Tell it how it is and you know I won't change
Ooh take a break
Call in sick to work
And come my way
Baby you can pick the day
It pays to be the boss
23 years and I never had a job
I知 like woaah
All these bad bitches on my phone
Girl I知 in your city and I wanna take u home
No diamond on me drippin swagoo on my own
Hit it wit the sauce like Ragu then I知 gone
Riding in a benz
I can't hit that bitch unless she is a 10
I ain't worried boutcha itty bitty, bands
I might fuck your bitch a little bitty, damn
Ay ay
I wanna hit it on repeat
Ay ay
Hit till we sleepy
Everybody keep hatin
Wanna be me
I知 so powerful my energy is seeping
