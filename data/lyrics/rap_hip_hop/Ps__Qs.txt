Some manors don't like me, they try and badmind me
When Kano comes to town
All I say is "mind's right", and they lose the limelight
When Kano comes around
Some try screw me or even slew me
But it don't work 'cause the crowd don't boo me
You ain't a true G, I'm too deep
How can Kano stay underground?
I ain't like most that roll around
And kick shit off, I hold it down
But we're still gully
The only 'pop' you'll hear from us is
Pop-pop-pop, then we're out
Act up and get boxed in the mouth
'Cause you're just playing a gangster
You ain't never weighed the ounce, fought a bouncer
You ain’t never hid no blots in your mouth
You ain't got love in North, West and South
And I'm an East boy, you're a chief boy
I finish it when you start the beef boy
Girls like me but I ain't a sweet boy, so boy
Don't think you can move to me and think I'll be asleep boy
'Cause I'm on my P's and Q's
That's why I make more P's than you's
Even when I'm in 3s and 2s, slip?
There ain't no reason to, slipping
If there ain't a blitz between the clique, that's slipping
No whip, out the manor linking chicks?
That's slipping, that's slipping

If you see me and I ain't with my crew
Believe I'm on my P's and Q's
Even on my own two
That's the difference between me and you
If you see me and I ain't with my crew
Believe I'm on my P's and Q's
Even on my own two
That's the difference between me and you
If you see me and I ain't with my crew
Believe I'm on my P's and Q's
Even on my own two
That's the difference between me and you
If you see me and I ain't with my crew
Believe I'm on my P's and Q's
Even on my own two
That's the difference between me and you

I hate losing, so I ain't snoozing
From London to Luton, I'm moving
I'm even merking overseas
And I got it locked from London to Leeds
Please, from time you heard me shine
Now I'm big from London to Merseyside
You got lines but you spit like nursery rhymes
This year's gotta be mine, I'm the first in line
Wow, you got your first rewind
But the second line sounded like the first line
I ain't got punchlines, I got kick lines
And I ain't commercial but I got hit lines
I spit deep rhymes
But I've got the girls on my side from the first rewind
You might see my face in a magazine
Or in a fur coat in FACE Magazine
'Cause they're spreading the word down from raves that I been
And they're bringing the purse out to pay for my team
I couldn't give a shit, I'm breaking the scene
Making a scene then start making the cream
Seen? I got a gang with me
And we all walk with a gangster lean
You're all talk, you don't wanna ramp with me
There's no jokes or no pranks with me

If you see me and I ain't with my crew
Believe I'm on my P's and Q's
Even on my own two
That's the difference between me and you
If you see me and I ain't with my crew
Believe I'm on my P's and Q's
Even on my own two
That's the difference between me and you

If you see me and I ain't with my crew
Believe I'm on my P's and Q's, in sneaks or shoes
We're in a Honda, fuck it, no Jeeps and coupes
We'll chief your crew, we're so hungry, we'll teef your food
So mind out before you find out who you're speaking to
I speak to youths on a level, and speak the truth
So please, there's thug in me
But there ain't no me in you
And please, you ain't bussing one, let alone squeezing two
Say cheese, but it won't be a snapshot
Pull out and try and hit like the jackpot, leave
I ain't waiting around, baiting the town for Kane to be found
That's slipping
If there ain't a blitz between the clique
That's slipping
No whip, out the manor linking chicks?
That's slipping, that's slipping

If you see me and I ain't with my crew
Believe I'm on my P's and Q's
Even on my own two
That's the difference between me and you
If you see me and I ain't with my crew
Believe I'm on my P's and Q's
Even on my own two
That's the difference between me and you
