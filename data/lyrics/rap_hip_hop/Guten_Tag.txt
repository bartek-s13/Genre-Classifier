Get-Get money and gold, we multitask
Back-Back then used to drive round ends in faulty cars
Look at my face, all these scars
Girls still chase, call me Hards
Don't tark too much like Stormzy’s darg

Life's improvin' fast
Look at that German, guten Tag (Wagwan)
Hollywood, cruisin’ past
Now I've got bare man movin' sarft (Outside)
I like roofless cars
Me and my girl do rooftop bars
Cop me a house before I got jewels
Uni got a man movin' smart

She wanna talk feelings, meet and greetin'
Me, I just smashed then leavin' (I'm gone)
They talk 'bout beefin’, diss, diss, sneakin’
Niggas get splashed for speakin' (Ching)
White like Peter, brown like Cleveland (Yeah)
Trap fit, I’ll be out all evenin'
My white ting lookin' Madonna
I hate it when she leaves makeup on my collar

Me and Dave got matchin' Mercs (Mm)

Bare of the mandem trap

Tings on the go, hotel
Doin' up snaps, matchin' robes (Yeah)
Look at these losers, man's exclusive (Look, look, look, look)
Me and Neymar got matchin' clothes

It's like everyting I dig
They think they're wifey
And she thinks she's my main
But that's my side piece (Side ting)
Still break down Liz on my scale
Do it gentle, nicely (Chop it)
Jump out on sidestreets (Where you goin'?)
See them, I let mine squeeze

Pure cash, no receipts (Nah)
All black, so discrete (All back)
Let a man get pussy in private
Let a man get dough in peace (Mm-hm)
Right now overseas
Changed up, noticeably
Got a WAG tellin' me, "Come over"
Dash my balls in her ovaries

Might pull up on your bitch, I'm vain
Excuse me, miss, can I get a name? (Excuse me, miss)
My team, they're ready for stains
Mind he don't grips your neck and chain
Came from dishin' out pebs in the rain
Do it on the ends or send it on a train (Send it up)
Man do it so styley, white like Miley

These girls got A-S-S but love A-S-S-U-M-E
Niggas always gon' ask for shit (Facts)
Bitches always gon' ask for dick (Facts)
Dick long, I'm a narcissist
I can't even put half my tip (True)
Niggas hate, nothin' new
Middle finger, my partin' gift (Fuck 'em)
Balmain, that's a starter kit
But I need a Louis Vuitton partnership
