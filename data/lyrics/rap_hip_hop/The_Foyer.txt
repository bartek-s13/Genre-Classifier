You can't feel those arms of mine
Made me feel so dead tonight
Can't dissolve your noxious mind
I'll treat you right
Can't resolve this toxic plight
From my line of sight

You forgot what love was like
Your hatred tastes like cyanide
I'm digging for a hopeless sign
Something of the like
Oh, I can't find the reason why you're treating me this way

You wanna keep me in the lobby
Is there room in your love tonight to take me away
You wanna keep me in the foyer
No room for a broken man to pay the way

You forgot what love was like
Your lips they taste like cyanide
Searching for a hopeless sign
Something of the like
Oh, I can't find the reason why you're killing me this way
You wanna kill me in the lobby
Is there room in your love tonight to take me away?
You wanna kill me in the foyer
Rent a room to a naked man to make it okay
You wanna have a fancy party
No need for a license to drive to drive me insane
Please, let me in your fancy party
You think big amends intent to keep me at bay
You think big amends intent to keep me at bay...

Well I can't find a reason why you're killing me this way
