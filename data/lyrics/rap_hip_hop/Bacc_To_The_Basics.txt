Quando Rondo, nigga
Ayy

Back to the basics nigga, back to the basics
Back to the basics nigga, back to the basics
Back to the basics nigga, back to the basics
Back to the basics nigga, aye

2012, I was twelve in a cell rappin' off of instrumentals, then Louie told me boy Quando you a fool wit' it
2013, got a .38 revolver, tucked it in my pants, swear I used to go to school wit' it
This a real life story so I gotta keep it real witcha
Stack-stack that money for a lawyer I been told that since a lil' nigga
I be totin' on a Tommy I ain't talkin' 'bout no Hilfiger
If it ain't about blue hunnids, nigga, I don't wanna deal wit' you, nah

Straight off the head but they gon' think that I wrote this
Couldn't afford no bed, on the floor with all the roaches
Shawty got good head, pussy wet just like the ocean
Adderall and the perkys the only thing that keep me focused

Doubled up with sticks, pistol, I'ma explode it
Double cup of drank got me movin' in slow motion
I let that ho meet my mother so now she thinkin' she a Bowman
I'ma fuck with no rubber, see, I don't really need no Trojan
I was sittin' in a cell when I made that "I Remember"
Now I'm fuckin' all these bitches and they name I don't remember
I was down bad on my dick just last September
Now every diamond on me hittin' cold like last winter
Couple months ago, see, I was sleepin' in the basement
Now I'm rockin' all these shows, turnin' up on all these stages
I had to tell my momma no, I gotta stack it up and save it
Real street nigga swear I came up from the pavement
I went to jail for a gun came home went back to them basics
I just hit a home run and I done touched all four bases
I know they hate I came up, I see the look on all they faces
My last bitch changed up, I left her in a free agent
Too many missed calls, why the fuck they keep on callin' me?
Shawty on the block list, why the fuck she keep on stalkin' me?
Came up from the projects to the top, that's where I ought to be
Grippin' on this FN, in case a nigga wanna start wit' me
Six plus six, twelve shots, I got two revolvers
More money, more problems, they be feelin' on the problem solvers
Shop at Neiman Marcus, 15 hunnid for my sneakers
Shirt made by Versace and the print came off a cheetah
Went to school and got suspended, never listened to my teachers
Now my life full of grinnin', turn them haters to believers
Shawty so one-hunnid, swear to God she keep it G though
But if I gotta beat you then baby I don't need you
Couple months ago, see, I was locked behind them cell doors
Took a trip to Cali just to spend a bag on Melrose
Whole team be ballin', I ain't talkin 'bout no Derrick Rose
Deep off in that water, I might just swim down the whale throat
Labels keep on callin' talkin' about signing, I'm like "Hell no"
Since like twelve I been on probation
I might go back to jail for the chances I'm takin'
I might need a cemetery for all of these dead faces

Back to the basics, back to the basics
Back to the basics, back to the basics
Back to the basics, back to the basics
Back to the basics, back to the basics
Back to the basics, back to the basics
Back to the basics, back to the basics
Back to the basics, back to the basics
Back to the basics, back to the basics

Straight off the head but they gon' think that I wrote this
Couldn't afford no bed, on the floor with all the roaches
Shawty got good head, pussy wet just like the ocean
Adderall and the perkys the only thing that keep me focused

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
