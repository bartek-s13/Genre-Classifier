They got my guys in the can
While you lie to the fans
Play the cards I was dealt
Now I'm liking my hand
Told my girl that I'm liking her tan
But she's too busy tryna' see who's liking my 'Gram
I spent time in the can, 'cause I ride for my fam'
And all this ice on my hand
It got your baby mother hella likely to bang
And I will never change bro, I like who I am

Bro we're turning up
Catch us in the club and we're burning buds
That's my nigga in the foreign, see him burning dust
Put my brother in jail said he's serving drugs
But that's work to us
So I hide the pain through these designer frames
Bro died and I put him on a diamond chain
Came outta jail to a mic and stage
And it's different from the trap but I like the change

Catch me out in my block in Gucci linen
With the cutest women, we're so used to winning
Don't ask why we're used to sinnin'
It's that coupé I'm whippin', past the bando I used to live in
You got you're watch from this rapping ting
But me I got my watch from this trapping ting
Me and bro on the same bike saddling
Now I press sports on a Merc' and we're vanishing
Maddest ting, keep it humble, I didn't have a thing
Don't say much, I've been through a lot
And you're queen is a dot bro she's been through the block
My new shits mad, you ain't seen what I got
And all these boxes and kilos
Got me the same watch as the Migos
You got a Z but it's a box when I reload
And the streets know you're flexing in deets'ed clothes
Bro we're turning up
Catch us in the club and we're burning buds
That's my nigga in the foreign, see him burning dust
Put my brother in jail said he's serving drugs
But that's work to us
So I hide the pain through these designer frames
Bro died and I put him on a diamond chain
Came outta jail to a mic and stage
And it's different from the trap but I like the change

I swear I wonder how my life would be
If I didn't, go and meet the plug
15 knee deep in the streets, where my niggas?
I didn't need the love
And my dad, he ain't really shit
But I'd be lying if I say I didn't need my mum
Gyal always stressing going through some drama
Telling me she need a hug
Yo it's safe to say, I was stuck in the hood with no place to stay
You weren't nowhere around tryna' save the day
Now you're all in my face cuz my papers straight
Fam I'll never show you niggas how to bake a cake
They say life is a test, I'm sure that I'm winning my lighty's the best
Gun shots were beating, we're sliding them west
Them man are singing they're trying there best
Bro we're turning up
Catch us in the club and we're burning buds
That's my nigga in the foreign, see him burning dust
Put my brother in jail said he's serving drugs
But that's work to us
So I hide the pain through these designer frames
Bro died and I put him on a diamond chain
Came outta jail to a mic and stage
And it's different from the trap but I like the change
Bro we're turning up
Catch us in the club and we're burning buds
That's my nigga in the foreign, see him burning dust
Put my brother in jail said he's serving drugs

Bro died and I put him on a diamond chain
