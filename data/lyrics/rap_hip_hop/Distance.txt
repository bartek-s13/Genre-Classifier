Black Range Rove when we pull up (pull up)
Doing shit I never would imagine (hey)
Woke up in the hills with a bad bitch
Daddy girl, money living lavish
Getting too accustomed to these habits
No one could say I had a bad trick

Every damn day tryna steal my soul (soul, soul, soul, soul)
Get it my way, only way I know (I know, I know)

Shorty do the map, do the distance (hey)
