Left flowers on the table, I'm missing your touch
The way that you hold me, put no one above
I picture you naked when you're outta town
My sole inspiration lately (Lately)

All night's how I want it (Want it)
I know you been patient with me
All night's how I need it (Need it)
Tell me, girl, do you crave it like me?
Hit me up when you're lonely (Lonely)
I know that you're waiting tonight
One time if you save it tonight

Sometimes, I love myself
Touch myself
Thinking of you
Sometimes, when you're gone
Far from home
Thinking 'bout you, baby
Just like you, just like you (Just like you)
Just like you, just like you (Just like you)

Kiss on your navel, my hands on your waist
Obsessed with your flavor, I just want a taste
My caramel shorty, you're deep in my soul
Stop talking so naughty, you're crazy
You talk too much shit
All night's how I want it
I know you been patient with me
All night's how I need it
Tell me, girl, do you crave it like me?
Hit me up when you're lonely
I know that you're waiting tonight
One time if you save it tonight

Sometimes, I love myself
Touch myself
Thinking of you (Thinking about you)
Sometimes, when you're gone
Far from home (Home, baby)
Thinking 'bout you, baby
Just like you (Just like you), just like you
(Every morning, love it, fuck it up)
Just like you (Just like you), just like you

Sometimes, I love myself
Touch myself
Thinking of you (Thinking about you)
Sometimes, when you're gone
Far from home
Thinking 'bout you, baby
Every morning, love it, fuck it up
