Oh yeah, oh yeah
She said I hate my day job; I don't feel it
I need racecar, top down to match my ceiling
I don't have none (Have none), dollar billies (Have none)

She said I hate my day job; I don't feel it
I need racecar, top down to match my ceiling
I don't have none, have none, dollar billies in my bag
Run— bag, run, fuck your feelings, I detach them

Wonder why I had them, with her bad lungs
Running back to 'em, keep coming back if I hadn't known

Busy on the inside, why ain't got the answer

She said I hate my day job; I don't feel it
I need racecar, top down to match my ceiling

Took her hand in July, couple months, fall again

Hate my day job; I don't feel it
I need racecar, top down like my ceiling
I don't have none, have none
Yeah, yeah

She said I hate my day job; I don't feel it
I need racecar, top down to match my ceiling
I don't have none, have none, dollar billies in my bag
