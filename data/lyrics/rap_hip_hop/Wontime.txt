One bullet 

Before I lay my head down to rest
I roll up a nickel sack of cess to relieve the stress
The herb and the calisthenics do a nigga justice
They fit cause some are slick and can't be trusted
I put up with none of them punks who front shit
Even though some I used to run with and smoke blunts with
Fuck the foreplay let's do shit the raw way
Kill a he say-she say, check what we say

I'm dwelling in the cellar with my niggas Heltah Skeltah
Loading up the clips with lyrics, punks run for shelter
Smif-N-Wessun's on the loose with a noose for your neck
You let info slip out so its dead you get
There's the Black Moon we creeping up in your room
Death fills the air along with the scent of boom
Open your eyes motherfuckers and greet your fears
Off with the head of a snitch and he's outta here

 One rhyme for the snitch dropping dime
 One time!
 One rhyme for the heads doing time
 One time!
 One rhyme for the crooks committing crime
 One time!
 One time for your motherfucking mind
One bullet 

Sitting in the pens with my back against the gate
Hot as a fuck can't wait to get that bus heading upstate
New plate, same faces from the last joint
Got my banger so when danger come I'll be on point
In the parallel cell mad niggas flip
Cause some big bear doing dip just got his ass ripped
Juveniles buck wild in this vicinity
Keep an open eye cause now I sleep with the enemy
Ready to thump with any chump with ideas
Nobody move, nobody gets blown from ears to rear

Thinking of a way to get even with my P.O
Cause I knew the bitch dicked a nigga on the D-Low
Now behind bars where scars come in pairs
Trooping with my blowers 'case them niggas try to bring it here
Flipping on the bitch ass who got cash and commissary
Cause I ain't going home till Nevuary
Another straight up "No" coming from the board
Keep my anger hid  until I'm back up in the ward
Niggas know whats the word cause the grill is blank
Once again its on, sucker-type, grab your shanks

 One rhyme for the snitch dropping dime
 One time!
 One rhyme for the heads doing time
 One time!
 One rhyme for the crooks committing crime
 One time!
 One time for your motherfucking mind

Well I was taught two wrongs don't make a right
But me and Ripper been real tight for a while and everything's aight
I got one in store for hardcore fanatics
Banging from basement to attic for static if you got dramatics
Who's the next up for heads up? When my lead's used up
I'll get my baseball bat and you'll get bruised up

Word Life my semi-automatic end static
Smoking lye's more than a habit
And our victims die tragic
We stalk around like the beast out for prey
Packing the ammo pulling more juks by the day
Taking loot wit my crimeys on the run from the coppers
Boot Camp's on the map and ain't no way that you can stop us

Get out my way nigga, I'm coming through deep
And my fleet packs heat
Ain't nothing sweet, we play for keeps
I got money on my mind and my hand on my nine
Gots to get mine cause my life's on the line
I roll with the Ripper and the Ripper roll with me
And my bred-dread D to the O-G

See we be hitting up boom spots a lot
In the cypher getting high with the hoods on the block
If you don't know we, don't even come in my circle
Fuck around and get me vexed and I'mma hurt you
Bumba clot rudeboy, lick off your nine
As we hit you one time for you fucking mind

 One rhyme for the snitch dropping dime
 One time!
 One rhyme for the heads doing time
 One time!
 One rhyme for the crooks committing crime
 One time!
 One time for your motherfucking mind
One bullet
