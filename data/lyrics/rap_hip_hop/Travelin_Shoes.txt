Me and my old lady
Ain't been gettin' along
Things don't get better
I'll soon be long gone
This situation's driving me insane
Somebody fetch my coat and hat and hand me my walking cane
Gotta put on my travelin' shoes
Gotta put on my travelin' shoes
Gotta put on my travelin' shoes
Gotta put on my travelin' shoes
I'm trying to tell you, boys
These hard-headed women these days
The way they try and treat a man
Ain't nothing but a doggone shame
I talk and talk and talk
She didn't hear a word I said
Gonna get Hank Aaron's baseball bat
And tenderize her head
Gotta put on my travelin' shoes
Gotta put on my travelin' shoes
Gotta put on my travelin' shoes
Gotta put on my travelin' shoes
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
I'm trying to tell you, boys
I've just about had enough
I'm not gonna stick around
And put up with all this stuff
This situation is enough to kill a man
Somebody fetch my coat and hat and hand me my walking cane
Gotta put on my travelin' shoes
Gotta put on my travelin' shoes
Gotta put on my travelin' shoes
Whoo!
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
