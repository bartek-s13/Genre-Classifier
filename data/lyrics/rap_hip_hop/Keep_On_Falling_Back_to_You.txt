Summer love
What a joke!
Heh
Many years
Hey!
探il heart is broke
Dang!
But
I forget too easy;
Sun is up and the wind is breezy
And you池e so gosh darn pretty too
I fall in love when I look at you, so

I keep on falling back to you
Falling, I知 falling back, I知 falling, I知 falling back, I知 falling, I知 falling - what, Yo!
I keep on falling back to you
Woah-oh
Woah-oh-oh (Yeah! Yo!)

Armed with a pen and a pad
Verses of rap
Versus the love that I had
Know that we said it痴 a rap:
Thanks for the laugh!
Girl have you ever met Jack?
You could hit the world and I could hit the road, yeah
I壇 still be in love and I already know, yeah
Oh yeah! I got a heart with your name on it
Say what you want bout it
Can稚 do a thang bout it!
Will we again? Doubt it
But that痴 the thang (thang):
I知 so dang in love with you that it made me insane, woo!

And I guess I知 wrong, at least so I知 told, cause you been so cold
But this all I know
You know, you know
I壇 rather be wrong, ignore what I知 told, and hear out my soul
Cause this all I know
It痴 all I-ahhhhhh-hahhhhh

I keep on falling back to you (back back woo!)
Falling, I知 falling back (woo!), I知 falling, I知 falling back (woo!), I知 falling, I知 falling - what, Yo! (Yeah!)
I keep on falling back to you, (back back woo!)
Woah-oh (back back woo! Back back woo!)
Woah-oh-oh (back back what!)

What痴 the sitch? Uh
Quick switch-up
Million calls I give ya, now I pick up
And chit chat, hit back, yeah I give up
Just when I moved on I知 asked which one and
Dang this is impossible
But I guess it痴 possible
Sorry girl I gotta go
Something that I gotta know
Now here I am alone again
With over-thinking things: my only friend

And I guess I知 wrong, at least so I知 told, cause you been so cold (Col-ol-old)
But this all I know (Know-oh-oh)
You know, you know (Know-hoh)
I壇 rather be wrong, ignore what I知 told, and hear out my soul (Soul-oul-oul)
Cause this all I know (Know-oh-oh)
It痴 all I-ahhhhhh-hahhhhh

I keep on falling back to you (back back woo!)
Falling, I知 falling back (woo!), I知 falling, I知 falling back (woo!), I知 falling, I知 falling - what, Yo! (Yeah!)
I keep on falling back to you
Woah-oh
Woah-oh-oh (Yeah-ah)
I keep on falling back to you (back to you-ou)
Falling, I知 falling back, I知 falling, I知 falling back, I知 falling, I知 falling - what, Yo! (Oh-ohhh!)
I keep on falling back to you (back to you-ou)
Woah-oh (Woah-oh)
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-hoh-oh
Back to you-ou
Back to you
I keep on falling back
To you
Ha-ha
