Verse 1
Man I be ripping it, call me Shredder
I'm like every super hero just a 100 times better
Running down the beat, track star, I'm amazing
Leaving everyone with Jaws dropped in amazement
But I ain't famous, I ain't packing stadiums
I'm just letting my lyrics stay inside your cranium
Yeah, I'm really getting in your head
Because obviously you're repeating everything I said
Call me a Tsunami, my flow is just ruthless
I be spitting gold, you just spitting like you're toothless
Get it? Because I punched you with a punch line
Leaving you with two black eyes, in the front side
Now, Turn the volume up a little louder
I just want to say, middle finger to the doubters
Everybody know that our crew always be shining
Because everybody know were mothereffin diamonds
Chorus
DMND clan
We flashy cause we can
Yeah we all hypin cause we rockin all these brands
Cause we shining all day err day err day
We some bright ass diamonds like the sun in the day
Err day err day f what everybody say
Can't see em cause we shine too bright real diamonds wassup
