(No warning shots?)
Shit
When I let off, I plan to knock a motherfucker head off
Bonk, bonk, bonk!
I spit three before his grip get firm
Bonk, bonk!
And two more at whoever act like they concerned
Bonk!
One to let him wonder if I'm empty
(You got sixteen left)
I hope he tempt me
Now
Bonk!
That's to let him know it can get drastic
Bonk!
That's for trying to detour the traffic
Bonk!
That's cause you a straight faggot bastard
Bonk!
That's your Easy Pass to a casket
Bonk!
That's for acting like you don't know the name
Bonk!
That's for acting like this shit is a game
Bonk!
That's for closing your eyes when you aim
Bonk!
That's for trying to fuck with Lil' Fame
Now, no (no!), body (body!) (nobody)
Will eat
Nobody will sleep
We running the street
You might wanna pick your weight up
(And pick your eight up)
Before you get your ass ate up, straight up
P.S

Now that you see me, you see my (niggas!)
I told you not to fuck with me and my (niggas!)
You can fuck with her don't fuck with me (nigga!)
You can fuck with him don't fuck with me (nigga!)
Like I said before, motherfuck you (niggas!)
I slap the snot, blood and ideas outta all you (niggas!)

Pissy ass
Bitchy ass
Fuck y'all!
Fuck all you
