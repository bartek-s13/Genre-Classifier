Fuck them, I don't know them, they ain't one hunna
In my German car, drop a big pack on my young gunner
In the trap, I make mad stacks off one number
When you're at the pot, you can lose it all off one fuck up

On the High Road and I'm drivin' slow with one ucker
When I tell her "Suck", she don't say much, not one stutter
My nigga Sav poked a lot of yutes with one cutter
Feds kicked it in, got my niggas yard on the front cover
Free 'em, man's really out 'ere in the deep end
My Louboutin shoes are in season
Used to trap all night, it was freezin'
This Samsung keeps on beating
The Shard is where I'm sleepin'
Some steak is what I'm eatin'
I'm in Gaucho's with the G's dem
I put six bags on my left wrist
Put my brother Dotz on my necklace
Got my brothers locked for some next shit
Got a raw box then I press it
They talk it, I live it
Gotta call for the four in the midget
So I flew round to the kitchen
I got a few ounce by the biscuits

Young niggas gettin' street money till they lock me
I got a white girl with a big back, she talks Cockney
They see the kid and they skate out its not hockey
Keep the dots in the gym bag, true, its stocky

Whip, whip, whip then I'm servin'
Skatin' round in a foreign car, it straight German
Gotta bad bitch with a big back she likes twerkin'
I gotta new trap and I told the cats "It needs curtains"
He threw me a bird and I jerked him
Me and him ain't squared 'til I burst him
I dice packs and I drop packs on the workman
I got stacks thats for certains
I miss Dotz, bro, I'm hurtin'
I'm with Mouth, bro, we're lurking
I just buy straps I don't reason
'Cause my man thinks we're beefin'
But when I slide round, I don't see him
Or he's breezin' like a athlete
The whole squad know I back beef
Treat restaurants like they're McD's
Taught my young boy how to stack P's
I came up off a crack fiend
Throwin' this paper, no littering
Aged fifteen, I was bit'n'win
I'm eating in Gaucho's, you're getting slim
I need two scales when I get it in
Cooked two Z's in ten minutes
I gotta trap spot, I'm renting it
Just cling and carbs, no beds in it
And I'm out the door if a feds in it
Done a lotta shit, I ain't regretting it
I get the raw and I'm extending it
If the coke's hard then I'm blending it
I dont know nuttin' 'bout no benefits

Young niggas gettin' street money till they lock me
I got a white girl with a big back, she talks Cockney
They see the kid and they skate out its not hockey
Keep the dots in the gym bag, true, its stocky

Fuck them, I don't know them, they ain't one hunna
In my German car, drop a big pack on my young gunner
In the trap, I make mad stacks off one number
When you're at the pot, you can lose it all off one fuck up
