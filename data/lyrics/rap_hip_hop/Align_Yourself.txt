(Yeki Bood, Yeki Nabood)
(It's 3:30 in the morning, I'm still here. Arya please pick up the phone)

Still in my camera roll
I hate that you’re in my phone but
Memories keep me warm
When living it makes me cold
Missing your innocence
You loved me before I hit
And fucked me like no one else
And broke me like no one since
(Wh do you love me for?) X2
Finger tips bleeding on the beads of my rosary
Pen leaking from the holes its seeks
It’ll never ever find them until, until
I forgive the things that you stole from me
I’m talking to the mic like it was you and me
We passed the time limit
But for the last time will you ride with me


Remember all the nights we would get so fucked up
And I would
And I would
And I would
Check on you til you felt good
My hand glued to that Jameson
You couldn’t give a fuck about the pain I’m in
Done a couple things wish you hadn’t of
Wish you hadn’t of
Now they’re adding up, have you have enough?
I got the pain and regret in my chest
When I think of your sex
Or I think of your breath
And I think I’m depressed
Til I’m looking at you and the pain is the proof
And the fame is the proof of my sorrow to you
Always writing you tracks and I’m writing attacks
Keep my wallet in tact, you should file every tax how
Capitalizing upon your heart break
Shit my T4 scream heartache
(Zereh ghombadeh kabood)


Still worry Cus I see the pain you try to run from
But fuck the track, quit running like you’ve never done stuff
My shirt is soaking from there’s tears but nothing can be undone
This dirty laundry can’t haunt me the you wanted
Every urge said you were dangerous, should’ve never fought it
You think I’d spite you, steal your friends, throw you in a coffin?
I took the bullet, and they followed from whence you shot it
And even though the scar is fresh, I’d always check upon you
Not to fuck with you or harm, but because I’m sorry
See my mistakes, I’ll take responsibility for scaring
But you think I have it out, so I’m leave barring
Only feelings of discomfort for the hell you’re far in
And shit my patience running thin, when I try to grin
I know you’ll take it as a dis, don’t mean to offend
Ain’t nothing left but the empathy I feel
I’ll give it time, Cus time is the only way it heals
