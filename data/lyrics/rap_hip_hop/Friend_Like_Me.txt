Here I go!
Unh, ooh, woo!
Back up! Uh-oh! Watch out! Unh!
You done wound me up!
'Boutta show you what I'm workin' with, unh!

Well, Ali Baba, he had them forty thieves
Scheherazade had a thousand tales
But, master, you're in luck because up your sleeves
You got a brand of magic never fails
You got some power in your corner now
Heavy ammunition in your camp
You got some punch, pizazz, yahoo, and how?
All you gotta do is rub that lamp
And then I'll say

Mister– Man, what's your name? Whatever–
What will your pleasure be?
Let me take your order, I'll jot it down
You ain't never had a friend like me
Life is your restaurant
And I'm your maitre d'
Come, whisper to me whatever it is you want
You ain't never had a friend like me
We pride ourselves on service
You the boss, the king, the shah!
Say what you wish, it's yours! True dish
How about a little more baklava?
Have some of column A
Try all of column B
I'm in the mood to help you, dude
You ain't never had a friend like me

Oh! Unh!
It's the big part, watch out!
It's the big part, oh!

Can your friends do this?
Can your friends do that?
Can your friends pull this
Outta they little hat?
Can your friends go–
I'm the genie of the lamp
I can sing, rap, dance, if you give me a chance, oh!

Don't sit there buggy-eyed
I'm here to answer all your midday prayers
You got me bona fide, certified
You got a genie for your charge d'affaires
I got a powerful urge to help you out
So what's your wish? I really wanna know
You got a list that's three miles long, no doubt
Well, all you gotta do is rub like so
Mister–

Aladdin

Yes!
One wish or two or three
Well, I'm on the job, you big nabob
You ain't never had a friend, never had a friend, you ain't
Never had a friend, never had a friend
You ain't never (Never!)
Had a (Had a)
Friend (Friend)
Like (Like)
Me!
