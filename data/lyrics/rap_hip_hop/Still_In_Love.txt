You’re the only thing thats been on my mind
Recently I don’t know why
When i develop feelings I draw a line
So I push you aside
Although I try to fight it
Make up reasons
To deny you
In my life
Although I try to fight it
Know its true
I’m still in love with you
I’m still in love with you boy
Something in your eyes
Sees me through
Im still in love with you
I told you one too many times to go away
What would you think if I asked you to stay
If I reached in to give you a kiss
Would you reject me
Or did you miss me?
Like I’ve been missing you
Like I’ve been missing you
Like I’ve been missing you
You
Although I try to fight it
Make up reasons
To deny you
In my life
Although I try to fight it
Know its true
I’m still in love with you
I’m still in love with you boy
Something in your eyes
Sees me through
Im still in love with you
