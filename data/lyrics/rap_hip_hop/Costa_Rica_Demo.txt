Lyrics from Live Preview

I got big dreams so my watch got a big face
Girls get messy like a motherfuckin' mixtape
Smellin' like money and I'm lookin' like sex
I'm outside for real with the slimes and the slatts
Nigga ride wave, then the nigga get taxed
Fendi snowpants and I fill 'em up with racks
They all ball cap, and this all facts
No, I don't relax and I don't lack

Demons, they follow me deep in the dark
Niggas got problems with being a boss
We ain't been home but we hear all the talkin'
Hit 'em with hollows and clean 'em with salt
Salt in the wound and my heart in the cooler
Frozen like I gave my heart to my jeweler
Told him to make a new piece out of this
Ever since, I just can't give no fuck 'bout no bitch

Baby, had to bustdown on the AP, yeah
Baby, ain't no rich styles on you lately, yeah
I got fans in Costa Rica, I got bands in Costa Rica
I got fans in Costa Rica, I got bands in Costa Rica

Got the Mike Jack' nose, just before the vitiligo
Norman Bates with the eights, I'ma go psycho
Laundromat with a temper, this a vicious cycle
Feel like Rihanna, bitches go wherever I go
Go against the grain like I'm battlin' the silo
I'm going out west like I'm motherfuckin' Fievel
LeBron in the Finals, motherfuckin' Five-O
Nigga bettin' under 5' 4", hell if I know

Niggas got me tight like Arthur's fist and shit
Like I'm not an arsonist and shit
Not a nigga that you wanna argue with
'Cause then you fucking with your future like Larsa Pippen, shit
Boy, I'm like a barber with this shit
You get out the chair, you get in the chair
The things in the mirror, the way they appear
You look to the rear, my niggas is near, my niggas revered
You fuckin' with Mez, you fuckin' with Heirs, nigga

Baby, had to bustdown on the AP, yeah
Baby, ain't no rich styles on you lately, yeah
I got fans in Costa Rica, I got bands in Costa Rica
I got fans in Costa Rica, I got bands in Costa Rica

Top of the morning to anybody who thought it was beddy-bye
Jiddy, I'm like a Jedi or jumpin' Jehoshaphat
Them hoes who got a fat ass,  but they call they momma back
I don't know if that's a fact, but it don't matter
Anyone seen the bad ones, bad gas, bad cat last night?
Flew to Costa Rica with a AP
In the airport, this girl asked me, "Hey, are you Swae Lee?”

Knockin' on his door just like a domino
Baby, I'm a murderer, blow the water in the coupe
 said, "I'm diamond," the baguette, I'm like a tooth
Diamonds in my mouth, don't really talk loose
Girls who really with me fly with me
Learjet 5s, take a flight out to see ya
And they in the bathroom of the jet gettin' busy
Playin' with these niggas like woah

Baby, had to bustdown on the AP, yeah
Baby, ain't no rich styles on you lately, yeah
I got fans in Costa Rica, I got bands in Costa Rica
I got fans in Costa Rica, I got bands in Costa Rica
