Woo, woo woo
Ay la
Want me ni-
Ay (Skrr skrr)
Want me nicked, nicked
Want me nicked, nicked nicked
Yo
They want me nicked they phone the plod
I hate these snitches swear to God
Me straps still buried with the bugs
Had to hide it cos it's hot
In this world it's dog eat dog
Watch me make it out the fog
2 guns up I'll go out smoking, fuck the rats and all these jokers
In the trap house chilling with Mary could have been a wasted journey
Gotta get rid of this Bobby you know I had the (? White 0:50) gun early
In the George ken chilling with (? Fears 0:53) the ones with broken dreams
Fuck the consequences tell the judge free the team
I could never be no witness, I could never be no victim, no
My freedom might risk it gotta keep the money consistent
All these snakes and rats you gotta keep them at a distance
In the blink of an eye watch me risk it all, like I never took a risk before
Skid up score
Running up in your bando like I've been here before
Could've just knocked, but I came here to rob, that's why I kick off the door
Too much sauce, strap black like my trainers, everyone get on the floor
Blink of an eye, watch you lose it all, like I never took a risk at all
Big or small, me I take the chance if it's gonna make me more bankrolls (bankrolls)
If it's gonna make me more bankrolls (bankrolls)
I just bought a new wap and watch me buss it (buss it)
OT with my trappers watch us buss it
For the riches, pull up, hop out, bang, pull up in public
On me way to the money, jug, juggin to the morning
RedRum in reverse, with my Scousers 'bout to purge
Baby I'm so FTR here's a whopper for your purse
If a fuckboy tries to move to you, shoot him where it hurts
I'll grab you out that jam and slap that T5 in reverse
They want me whacked, they want me gone
But I can't go like that so it's on
Big fat shells go in the John
Fry the rats like a bacon on
In this world it's dog eat dog
Kick a door and rob a crop
Binbags full I'll go out running, tell the money that I'm coming
On the M-way to Cardiff 'cos I'm linked up with waff
Do the math, you know Scousers do the map
Dirt bike (? 2:23) doing wheelies while I'm sitting on the back
(? 2:27) Watch me wave it, cause a fucking heart attack
I'm moving reckless in the club, Armani bag holding the snub
They tell me "Tremzy you're a star", oh I came up out the mud
That's the L-8 to be precise if they don't like me lad that's life
I'm a plumber in the night, I met your girl I gave her... pipe
I just bought a new wap and watch me buss it (buss it)
OT with my trappers watch us buss it
For the riches, pull up, hop out, bang, pull up in public
On me way to the money, jug, juggin to the morning
RedRum in reverse, with my Scousers 'bout to purge
Baby I'm so FTR here's a whopper for your purse
If a fuckboy tries to move to you, shoot him where it hurts
