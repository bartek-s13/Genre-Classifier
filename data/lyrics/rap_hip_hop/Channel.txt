"A new universe that I'm making
No more waiting
Spent lifetimes in thought contemplating
Now I'm taking
My place as my true self, no one else
Could envision the divine visions
That my soul has been creatin'
Hesitation keeps you where you are
Manifestations are staying so far
Of a distance if you listened to your heart
Then you'd be reminiscing face to face with the God
That's inside of you
You're blinded to, your power so I am reminding you
It's time for truth and to discover who
Your true self is and to become a new
Never will I have to live a lie, cause what's inside
Is nothing but the truth keeping me alive
I confide, in my spirit when I hear it calling me
From what I've been fearing creeping in my mind
Stop time. Now I'm living in the now
Meditating no more waiting
I ain't worried about how
Cause I'm living in this moment
And my thoughts are so potent
That I'm sitting back knowing
It'll come if I allow
Projecting frequencies of what my higher self desires
Transcending from my ego, like a phoenix from this fire
New dimensions that I'm shifting through
Where my higher self is all that I listen to
Guide me down my soul's path
That will always last
Bring the truth to my life like my visions do
I open my whole soul up
To feeling new ways being sent from above, it's because
I never once believed in luck, always living this life as I'm channeling love
Channel who you really are
Your higher self's been calling out
I know your journey's been far
But it's the time to drop the doubts
Channel who you really are
Your higher self's been calling out
I know your journey's been far
But it's the time to live the now
I know who's here
I know who's listening
I will destroy all of these fears you have been witnessing
A new path that's created in this presence
Channel this energy right from our divine essence
All these vibrations emanating, creating
The life that you know you're here to live
You've been given a gift
And I know that it's hard to see
When your soul's been surrounded by nothing
But these fallacies
Leave them where they are, and move forward
It's only light and truth that you're moving towards
Break out of your shell, be your true self
No more hell
You no longer have to feel cornered
Just leave the past behind, redefine
Who you are in the present
Use the past as a lesson
Transform to the heart from the mind
Give it time, and find the answers to your questions
Every single one that your ego hides
Makes it hard to see all the truth inside
Governed by the light, buried deep inside
Exposed only when your universe collides
With that of your higher being
Future self in the mirror you'll be meeting
Open your senses up cause you're reaching
For your soul's very own expanded teachings
Now I'm leaving, those patterns and thoughts
That created my unconscious life
And I'm believing, that it happened this way
Just to bring me right back to the light
Channel who you really are
Your higher self's been calling out
I know your journey's been far
But it's the time to drop the doubts
Channel who you really are
Your higher self's been calling out
I know your journey's been far
But it's the time to live the now
The frequencies which I resonate with
Frequently appear cause they made it
Through space and time, sent from my mind
Every moment I live I know I've created
And it's always changing, symbols in a dream
Just rearranging
And new thoughts just came in
Focused on my pineal gland's vibration
It's because I'm attracting, every single moment
That has happened, I'm tapped in
To the source of action from the divine
And just living life as I imagined, and I'm asking
As I'm shifting through timelines, designed and defined
All by my higher mind
Stop time and I suddenly remind that another life I'll find
As I let my soul's truth shine
Stop time and I suddenly remind that another life I'll find
As I let my soul's truth shine
