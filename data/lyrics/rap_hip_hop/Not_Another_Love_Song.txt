Verse 1:
God please not another love song, most of all please not another love song
Another fake song, another Drake song, another make me feel all the time this way song
Play the tape through all the way till the tape's gone, game plays you? Young homie just play on
And stay strong, yeah stay strong, think about all the times and ways in which you came wrong
Not me, it’s not my shit, water meets its own level and the sick attract the sick
Could win a gold medal for the bitches that I pick, another waitress, yeah another fake bitch
But she wears all black and it's just like me, and when she snaps, yeah it's just like me
It might just be I keep trying to seek a design best aligned with the mind of me
Chorus:
I don’t think that you understand me, All I want is to understand you
Ride through the day with your friendship planned out
I think of ways that I could stand out, though I can see how this shit pans out
And I wish I saw you
But so much for wishing, I wanted you back and I made that decision
It backfired quick, now I'm sitting here tripping
How could it all go wrong?
Don't get it confused this ain't another love song
Verse 2:
My girl, my girl, where the fuck did you sleep last night?
In the pines, in the pines where the sun never shines, in the rise over run and we're running out of time
And I'm sitting while I'm summing up the hours I'm inclined, to say my devouring’s empowering the blind
Defiled by the scouring it’s like I'm defined by the vile vicious quickness of the blitz of a nine
Bullet goes to collect from the crown to the spine, to the mouth, to the bowels and it does it in a line
Bounce off my heart when it twists to combine, yeah, it’s a risk with a price
Departing when I cut from the cold compromise, and I'm cutting all the ties to the bullshit in your lies
Everything I've been through, who would think my demise? Add a link to the proof and the truth I reprise, like…
Chorus
Verse 3:
How fantastic, I've been cast as bat-shit, looking at the facets of the facts I’ve fashioned
All my actions, I imagined, would have fast paced to this place it happened
Let-me-be-the-first-to-say
Congratulations on the castration, need a vaccination in the worst of ways
Let-it-be-this-hurt-will-stay
My emasculation is a crass relation to my fascination with the games you play
It's my fault, can't say I'd go back, it's my fault, took the bait in the trap
Now I'm looking for escape, what a waste of a track, picking up the pace-put the pain in the past
Chorus
