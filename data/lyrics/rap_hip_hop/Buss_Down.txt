Buss down, yeah she get the buss down (Buss down)
10/10, man I hit a touch down (Touch down)
Nobody couldn't take a shot now (Shot now)
We busy makin' love and smokin' kush now
Buss down, yeah she get the buss down (Buss down)
10/10, man I hit a touch down (Touch down)
Nobody couldn't take a shot now (Shot now)
We busy makin' love and smokin' kush now

It's like I come round, touch down
Gyal get the rub down
Big dough, big girls, 'nuff pounds
Me, I take the love in and I spread the love out
You seen how I buss in, next I'll get the buss down
Pull up to the show with couple bros, you know it shuts down
Couple bruddas smokin' by the O, they blowin' nuff clouds
Sippin' by the bottle, gotta go because I'm slumped out
Takin' home a baddie and the pussy gettin' buss down (Uh-uh)
I make her blush when I call her sexy
Hold a brudda down, she does it all correctly
And she's 10/10, with too many peng friends
All of them are on me sayin' "always text me" (Yeah)
Got the 'ussy drippin', goin' swimming then I'm dippin'
Aitch, I tell the truth, I'm just in love with different women
Never go on dates, I'm sorry, I'm not really in it
I'm just livin' (Huh)
Buss down, yeah she get the buss down (Buss down)
10/10, man I hit a touch down (Touch down)
No wonder he couldn't take a shot now (Shot now)
We busy makin' love and smokin' kush now
Buss down, yeah she get the buss down (Buss down)
10/10, man I hit a touch down (Touch down)
Nobody couldn't take a shot now (Shot now)
We busy makin' love and smokin' kush now (Woo)

Yo, talk to me darlin', the flirtin' has started
I know exactly who I'm tryna go back to my yard with
Hella man are reaching, everybody wanna get a piece
But she don't ever ever put her pussy on the market (No way)
Huh, slow down
Short skirt, had to tell her "turn 'round"
She buss down, got me sayin' "oh wow"
Are you coming with me? 'Cause I wanna know now (Ah-aah)
Still she got me waitin', I ain't really got the patience
But there's somethin' telling me that it's all worth it, so I'm stayin'
Yeah, I know she feelin' me and tryna hide it, girl, you're playin'
Stop beatin' round the bush and just tell me what you're sayin'
Me and you, we can keep it on the low
Don't even tell your friends B, nobody needs to know
And I don't really like to speak on the phone
Let me know when I should leave and tell me where you need to go
Buss down, yeah she get the buss down (Buss down)
10/10, man I hit a touch down (Touch down)
Nobody couldn't take a shot now (Shot now)
We busy makin' love and smokin' kush now

Let me tell you a lil' somethin' manna fly
Always smokin' loud ammi', man I'm high
Talk a lil', make a lil' cash from my show now
Comin' from the gutters, now your shorty tryna blow now (Yeah yeah)
Come collect your lady or my nigga finna fuck
I ain't really on her, got a fix, she got the part
Hold her down, yeah she love the way I give a fuck
Pin her down, yeah she like it when a nigga rough

(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
