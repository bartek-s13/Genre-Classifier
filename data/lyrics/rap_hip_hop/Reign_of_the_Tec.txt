It's the hard little pistol-packing punk dope smuggler
Lethal when I kill, I go straight for the jugular
Back again to hit ya with the junkyard funk
Shit gets out of hand, I got a Tec in the trunk
Let's flip the ill shit kid, yo he looped it
Hardcore, straight to make you brothers act stupid
Now I'm on a rampage, prepare for the slaughter
Lyrical monster busting nuts in your daughter
Slaying competition is the real beat digger
(Clank) Hit you with a shovel now you're dead, nigga
Freaking the funk, I be the ill funk freaker
With the diabolical sound coming through your speaker
Bulletproof ready for action, no fronting
Fully loaded Tec, chump, ready to go hunting
So sleep and watch me let off and catch wreck
"John Wayne couldn't even stand the reign of the Tec"
When I pop the trunk, hit the deck
"John Wayne couldn't even stand the reign of the Tec"
Head for the hills before you get wrecked
"John Wayne couldn't even stand the reign of the Tec" (Repeat 2x)

Here I come up your block, drivin' drunk
Smoking skunk, waiting for a fucking punk
To beef, so he can get killed by the psycho thief
Retarded like Biz, eating cats like Heath-
Cliff, light the spliff, crack the quart and
If I kill you first nigga, be a good sport and
Die, don't give me no hassle
I snatch up your bitch, take her to White Castle
To crack her asshole, so I can fuck her
Hit that doo doo brown, then buck her
The crazy rapist smelling like much vaginas
Carjacking punks, pulling 'em out they Pathfinders
It makes me want to scream, but I just chill
By the end of the week, how many punks must I kill?
I'm sticking up picnics, I'm robbing 'em good so after dark
Stay the fuck out the woods (You fucking punk!)
When I pop the trunk, hit the deck
"John Wayne couldn't even stand the reign of the Tec"
Head for the hills before you get wrecked
"John Wayne couldn't even stand the reign of the Tec" (Repeat 2x)

Come on girl, don't give me that shit
Blast my nine to your spine, take your money then split
Audi, now your ass is ghost to me
Beatnuts on the loose sticking Hindu grocery shops
So what's up hops?
I shoot you with no problem, I'm used to shooting cops
I'll let you go this time, but next time you pop
That shit, your ass gets dropped

Yo, it's the gun-slinging lunatic demons outta hell
Intoxicated punks letting off bad smell
Beatnuts forever, die hard motherfuckers
Low-key deadly, taking out all suckers
Before you even step and try to play me, son
Bring heavy ammunition so you don't have to run
Take heed, this ain't something you should laugh to
Yo I'll shoot your moms if I have to
When I pop the trunk, hit the deck
"John Wayne couldn't even stand the reign of the Tec"
Head for the hills before you get wrecked
"John Wayne couldn't even stand the reign of the Tec" (Repeat 2x)
