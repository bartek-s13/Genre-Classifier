Told me not to worry
But it made me do it more
When you walked out of the door I started crying on the floor
Can't believe you’d leave simply 'cause you got bored
But for girls like you I guess that's the norm
And you’re a great actor cause I never saw the changes
Never woulda known on the low that you were faking
And now I'm in a rage shakin', screaming "I can't take this"
Throw my phone at the wall
And it shattered on the pavement
Now my hearts been ripped to shards that I could only hope to grasp
I been kickin with a homie while we smoking on the grass
Take a step back to the past with every flick of ash
And feel my passion leave every time I have to pass
Don't know why (?) my soul's a pit of blackness
I can try to pin it down but feelings never matchin'
I'm not who I used to be that kid is in the past
Since what you don’t know who you are till you up in the casket
So if we see you fucked up
By then it’s too late
So I been staying up and reflecting all of my mistakes
Already lack a soul and heart what's even left to take
I just take this shit and stride never been the type to break
People ask me how I been I lie and say I’m great but
I don't understand half the shit inside my brain
So I'm flipping through the dictionary trying to explain
I wanna have fun cause life's like a game
Wanna hit the end
Someone roll the credits
I try voice my pain but it feels like no one gets it
Took my heart strings and shred em like Led Zeppelin
She’ll have you begging for your life in a matter of seconds
She's been hanging with the snakes now she's a serpent
Made me feel this way and then said that I deserved it
She kissed me then stabbed me
So nobody heard it
I barely escaped now I'm broken and hurting
