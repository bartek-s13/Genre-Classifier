Here comes the money (here we go, money talk)
Here comes the money
Money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money, money

Ching ching, bling bling, cut the chatter
You ain't talking money, then your talking don't matter
Ching ching, bling bling, pattin' pockets
You make the dolla dolla, can't a damn soul stop it
Shock it (uhhh)

Here comes the new kid on the block
Hold all your bets here's where the buck stops
See first of all I am steppin' out on my own
Bout time I elevated to claim my own thrown
Success in my blood, Call it home grown
Pores reekin' testosterone
Power and money got me crazy, cocky
No longer need you papi
I know your mad because you can't stop me
And if you wonder how this playa done scooped your honey
I think she smelled my cologne, It's called brand new money
Making major moves ain't a damn thing funny
Pimpin' hood rats and playboy bunnies
They see the...

Money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money, money
They say it's, they say it's
Money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money, money
Say what, say what, say what? Money

I'm global dolla dolla and roll with bout 50
Like to go out smelling fresh and lookin' spiffy
Don't like clean money, I want my riches to be filthy
And a retirement fund I can't touch til I'm 60
So what am I supposed to do? Roll in two
Stand there pattin the pockets, 'till I'm stackin' only two
Ching ching, bling bling, got the cash in lumps
It's a four wheel here to jack and I'm selling them out my trunk
Whenever, whatever it takes to shake down a dolla
I roll in that direction, wait a minute (holla holla)
All I wants to know, where they go, where they went
And I'm makin' monster money, smellin' just like a mint

Money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money, money (Uh, money)
Money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money, money (nanana, nanana)
If you can't see the money
Get your eyes cleaned with visine
I need fine things worth 7 digits at a time, G
My chil'ren chillin, the best, never worst
See, we never give them pebbles they get the rocks first
Bank vaults on lock'n
Ching! Ching!
We're mockin
I’m rockin
My family’s Christmas stockins are shockin
Fine women, any weather
Naughty denim and leather
Call a chicken, whatever son they get better
I'm one smart cookie
The vet that smacks rookies
My stocks on top
Your checks bounce while mine boogie
Wrists, I must rock it
Chicks stop and I knock it
Cash looks like I got a gang of fists in my pocket

Here comes the money (fists in my, fists in my pocket, fists in my pocket)
Here comes the money
Money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money, money
