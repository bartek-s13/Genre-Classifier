How long will our people fight
I sit her thinking that this can't be life
There's kids like me getting shot tonight
and all we seem to be worried about is if he's black or white
Society's blind to the press and news
Eeverybody's arguing there present views
it seems racism's only in the hands of few so lets
unite as one and not divide as two.
I'm trynna make a change thats what writers do 'cause
God gave me power to enlighten you
It doesn't matter if you're dark or your eyes are blue
see if you're nice to me then i'll be nice to you.
Twitter made it cool to be rude and cocky
tweets being sent to the abused and awkward
300 Retweets on an ugly face
some of these words can't describe the disgust I taste
cause that girl you destroyed wants to be like you
beauty in it's form getting hella likes too
but instead she's in bed thinking "What did i do"
to deserve all the hate and now her life is through.
Staring down the barrel of a gun
18, man her life's just begun
Gripping on the trigger while her heart goes numb
This is our society and what it's become
and her daddy ain't there he's out selling rocks
he said he'll be there if she ever tried to tell the cops
so the only way out is the easy route
she gon' do it she gon' do it ain't no backing out.
*gunshot*
Damn.. another closed chapter
Now we stand hand-to-hand in this chapel
is this the same love you received on your Apple?
