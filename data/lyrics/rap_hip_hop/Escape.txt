You prolly won't understand it
I never take it for granted
My drive is on automatic
I plan on living so lavish
Reminded when just when I reminisce
Life is something I cherish, Man it's crazy how as people we do it all for the status
Post it up for the social it's really getting embarrassing
We all tryna stay relevant
Breaking out of our elements
These thoughts arising just from blowing on the cannabis
I'm always writing so just know that I would never quit
Over horizons man I'm straight from where Manila is
In speakers reaching to brown black and vanilla kids
I know they plotting they just waiting to stop me
They probably don't want me eating steak and wasabi
Was tired of getting salary
Tryna get paper hourly
I just wanted a lotta cheese
Take her out for some Japanese
Growing a money tree I just planted a lotta seeds
Been generous and I put that on my philanthropy
The good times is when I'm praying the most
Celebrating my team win is when I'm faded the most
Couldn't wait to spit this fire I was patient and cold
I pray for my foes. Y'all couldn't put a date on my flows
But I still got lotta shit to prove
Moving with a different view
Hang around shooters that won’t hesitate to get rid of you
Tell her I’m just tryna hit girl I ain’t really into you
Criticize but understand that I did what I needed to
Don't come around if you was never with us
My next goal is hitting seven figures
Said I was done but I beg to differ
We just play it safe and load up on some extra liquor
Don't come around if you was Never with us
My next goal is hitting Seven figures
Said I was done but I beg to differ
We just play it safe and load up on some extra liquor
We had to find another way when the door closed
Lotta mistakes you know you keep it real when your flaws show
Now we pulling off what they all said was impossible back home Imma drop a couple mills on a condo
Was hard to move like I was stuck in a box
Dealing with some grudges I ain’t even talking to pops
Was a lotta other shit that left me hurt to max
But fuck it Imma go and hunt for the cash
And that’s just really how it goes I been really tryna get it now
Shooting for my goals and I feel I’m bout hit it now
Said that I was ghost and I’m missing but I’m still around
Wouldn’t make it close that’s just something that I really doubt
Cos I made a vow we gon make it out the middle class
Came from empty pockets now I’m bout to count a million cash
Niggas taking shots I’m just chilling I don’t feel a threat
How she kinda mad I ain’t replying when I read the text
If you had it like I did you would prolly fold
Royalty when I’m throwing on a versace robe
If you ain't’ talking bout getting the bag it’s adios
It’s no debating you just gotta go
I can’t lie was fascinated by fast cars and designer clothes
Just tryna cop whatever mama chose
And so I had to plant a seed sit back and watch a dollar grow
This shit’ll turn into a pot of gold
Dont come around if you was vever with us
My next goal is hitting seven figures
Said I was done but I beg to differ
We just play it safe and load up on some extra liquor
