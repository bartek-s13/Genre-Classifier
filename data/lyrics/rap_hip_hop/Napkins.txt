Life is good, who's askin'?
Wrote my number down on too many napkins
Got tired of, "we'll see what happens"
Lights, camera, she 'bout that action

Which is good when I'm stagnant
And stuck to the mattress, stuck like a magnet
Life is good, but it's taxin'
Discourse, distractions
Discotheque, mathematics
Gave her my number after dancin'
Life is good, who's askin'?
You are not entitled to my time or my passion
Nights out ran me ragged
Got tired of bein' nice out of habit
You can ask, you can't have it
Shorty back home snack wrapped in a blanket

Life is good, who's askin'?
Wrote my number down on too many napkins
Got tired of, "we'll see what happens"
Lights, camera, she 'bout that action
Life is good, who's askin'?

She ask in Spanish
Can't understand it, still, somehow it's magic
Gave up on fashion
Changed up my balance, ate a salad
She got me Nikes, we went hiking
We got Popeye's, hopped a red-eye
We caught sunrise out in Bedstuy
Know her bedtime I slip out the crib too late, I meet my fate
That's bad for me, a casualty, say it's a meeting, it's a date
Feel like a dog, set my alarm for 5am, and then I left
Snuck into bed, disturbed her breath
I attest it's better to have loved and lost
Than to never have loved anything at all
But I loved it all too much and now I gotta fall
'Cause it's far

It's been good, shouldn't complain
But even when I win, I'm drained
I know I'm only gon' be sad again
'Cause none of this is permanent

Life is good, who's askin'?
Wrote my number down on too many napkins
Got tired of, "we'll see what happens"
Lights, camera, she 'bout that action

She think it's funny how
We always spendin' money goin' out
All the while we
Have everything we need at home
Now she
Wants me to start goin' out alone
So I drive away, smile on my face
