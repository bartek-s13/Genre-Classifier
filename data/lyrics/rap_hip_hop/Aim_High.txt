<<<<<<< HEAD
Yeah, yeah
I need a first class window
I never seen nobody fightin' for middle
I done seen a nigga that's too tired to get up
Grab a cup of water
He content with hiccup
Cool, calm vibe, my bitch so fine
C4 buy now we bouta blow right, right, right
Man, sleep your whole life away that shit like suicide
But who am I?

Look I've been workin' on myself
Discipline (Discipline)
Do or die, do or die, do or die
How the hell you gon' hit if you shooting low
Aim high, aim high, aim high, aim high
Aim high, aim high, aim high, aim high

They swear this shit ain't poppin' in the Carolinas
I'm at barber with a shawty
Shoot at every lineup
I ain't never seen a million I'm on full throttle
Yeah, deposits I like it
The same hands that get handouts you fight with
You gotta say whatchu meaning when you don't like shit
Ay, I used to be the nigga not controlling the vibe
They gotta see a leader when they look in my eyes (Yeah)
I gotta make this shit change (Shit change)
I ain't get up out the feels just to pump fake
Grab plates because you know that we divide pies
Four ways finna jump up on the price tag
Road rage
Soon enough you get fed up playing all day
You gotta add work
You've been prayin' all day
And never trust a hoe who be layin' all day
Yeah, yeah
I need the first class window
I never seen nobody fightin' for middle
I done seen a nigga that's too tired to get up
Grab a cup of water, he couldn't tent what hiccup
Cool, calm vibe, my bitch so fine
C4 buy now we bouta blow right, right, right
Man, sleep your whole life away that shit like suicide
But who am I?

Look I've been workin' on myself
Discipline, do or die, do or die, do or die
How the hell you gon' hit if you shooting low
Aim high, aim high, aim high, aim high
Aim high, aim high, aim high, aim high

Ay
You gotta watch these hoes
Hoes distract me
Fine ass hoes with the platine
Seen that ass on the Grammys
Seen the same ass in person
And honestly it's way fatter
Truth be told her friend badder
Truth be told you got a girl at home
On hold it don't matter
Oh my God look where your hands is
Oh my God
Oh you nasty
Oh my God
She's a savage
Oh my, oh my, oh my
