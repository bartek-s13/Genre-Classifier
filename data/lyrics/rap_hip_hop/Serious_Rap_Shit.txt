<<<<<<< HEAD
From jump street I thump beats that's bangin' in the street
See now my cypher's complete
I got each of my brothers on my side, right and left
Who's next to flex? I get more thrills than sex
Microphone is like a loaded MAC
Who's that there that's tryna hold us back?
I don't think so, we attack the premises
I'm like your nemesis and devils better remember this
Yo, the G-U-R-U of the Gang can always hang
I'll string you out with the dope that I sling
And you can't touch it, when I'm goin' off
And crazy shouts to my niggas up North
Although you're locked down, you're still on my mind
So rewind selector, rewind, rewind
I'm kickin' shit off my dome
I puff the chalice with dread, feel the steel, the real, the chrome

Me and my fam take this rap shit serious
New York to L.A., and you niggas best to fear this
Me and my fam take this rap shit serious
New York to L.A., and you niggas best to fear this

Ayo spark up the MAC, little shorty on some wild shit
I'll pull your file, walk down the streets without a smile, kid
Shit is gettin' hectic, I'm packin' a MAC-10
Niggas wanna check it, I'm thirsty for action
Ninety-five shit is real, gotta pack my steel
Just in case a nigga try to kill me, chill
I ain't goin' out like that
I bust enough caps in backs
And other niggas they be fakin' jacks
Best what, to back up, before you get smacked up
You act up, reload the clip, now back up
Straight up, don't let me break fool because you lose...

Me and my fam take this rap shit serious
New York to L.A., and you niggas best to fear this
Me and my fam take this rap shit serious
New York to L.A., and you niggas best to fear this
Me and my fam take this rap shit serious
New York to L.A., and you niggas best to fear this
Me and my fam take this rap shit serious
New York to L.A., and you niggas best to fear this

I sit back, and watch MC's take freefalls
Bounce 'em off walls like Superball
Stand tall, and terrorize MC's
All the ones who wanna be like me
You can't get with the exquisite shit I kid-ick
You get caught up, like Ted Kennedy, in Chappaquiddick
You can't roll with my flavor or style
I outlast MC's by miles, and I got
The hot style that pops
I'm givin' hardrocks, body shots when I rock
You can't even test me no matter how hard you try
Fuck around, lay around, punk, do or die
I'm back again, the roughneck nigga from Boston
When I swing I got mad drama that I bring
The crews all back me up
And we come to rip 'cause our shit's too rough, yeah!

Me and my fam take this rap shit serious
New York to L.A., and you niggas best to fear this
Me and my fam take this rap shit serious
New York to L.A., and you niggas best to fear this
Me and my fam take this rap shit serious
New York to L.A., and you niggas best to fear this
Me and my fam take this rap shit serious
New York to L.A., and you niggas best to fear this

Uhh
