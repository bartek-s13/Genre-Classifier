Stay up, shake me out
Take your time, I'll wait it out
Player, player
All these ghosts don't phase me now
Make eighty thou', no carry outs
Stay in a ton, let's wear it out
Focus, beside me now, on her knees

Be your deity, enemy, no telling why you're failing me
You're safe
Your deity
Your deity (Oh yeah)

Enjoy my fake love for one night
Hang on, I'll save you, you wish
That were the case here
Yeah, I like, I don't mind, I don't mind
Probably off on him, take all this
Only thing that I beg for is your pardon
One thing, don't feed off of the gossip
'Cause all that talk is still talking
And when that stop, we can't knock it
Look at all this crop we made off it
I can't reach what I've lost, I'm a fiend for you
Be your deity, enemy, no telling why you're failing me
You're safe, yeah, I might find me ok
(Be your deity) Enemy, no telling why you're failing me
You're safe
Your deity

Stay up, shake me out
Take your time, I'll wait it out
Player, player
All these ghosts don't phase me now
Come to find you, hate me, facing some time
Weight on my shoulders
Breaking, on her knees

Be your deity, enemy, no telling why you're failing me
You're safe, yeah, I might find me ok

Your deity
