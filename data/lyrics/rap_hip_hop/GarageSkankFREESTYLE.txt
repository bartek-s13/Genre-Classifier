There's a whole leap of gyaldem running man down, true stories
You can't introduce riddimdim like me
Made in the manor, yeah, I'm from the East

Gyaldem ting, gyaldem ting
Box of the Rosé, champs and ting
Badman ting
Which man are on a badman ting?
Must have been chest day, abs and ting
Leng it down, leng it down
Come to the dance and, leng it down
White-boy wasted, Gazza’d out
Two gun-fingers
Garage Skank

Who put the skip in the skippy flow?
Who keeps the kids on their tippy toes?
Who put the Skinners in videos?
Who put the hits on the hitlist?
Who put the crisp in the biscuit?
Man like Fonti on a mission though
I'm a Robinson and don't live in Bow
If you don't man that's a living GOAT
I rep East London with the realest quotes
Ride out ting
Young box on a ride out ting
Fuck that, seven seater to Heathrow
Fly out ting
Gyaldem ting, gyaldem ting
Box of the Rosé, champs and ting
Badman ting
Which man are on a badman ting?
Must have been chest day, abs and ting
Leng it down, leng it down
Come to your shubs and, leng it down
White-boy wasted, Gazza’d out
Two gun-fingers
Garage Skank

Pub quiz, who put the Eski in Eskimo?
Shell down dance like Tempa bro
And still puttin petrol at Texaco
Who put metaphors in this grime shit?
Man like Sharky and I did
Old skool like Randy and them man there
Furthermore Andrew and them man there
Crawford, man are family with them man there
Likkle mad ting with Ramsey and them man there
Ai it's cool now, old news
Evening Standard and them man there
Think I finna fly Bambi and them man there?
Now I floss like Lambi on them man there!
If you ain't at Angie's with them mandem
Social man are anti with them mandem
Spyder man are champs with them mande-de'
Some man are pretend, man
Us man here don't party with them man
One Grey Goose and pack up with ten man
I don't really roll out but if I do we go all-out
Drink all night so we can ball out
Fall in line, nah, we will fall out
Tell a girl "Why front?"
Like my underpant
Man are bedroom bully, Shabba Ranks
Gyaldem ting, gyaldem ting
Box of the Rosé, champs and ting
Badman ting
Which man are on a badman ting?
Must have been chest day, abs and ting
Leng it down, leng it down
Come to your shubs and, leng it down
White-boy wasted, Gazza’d out
Two gun-fingers
Ooh, ooh

There's a whole leap of gyaldem running man down true stories
You can't leng down a stage show like me
There's a whole leap of gyaldem running man down, hold tight the gyaldem though, hold tight the ends too

And again and again
In too deep
Blood I'm in too deep
Part of the furniture in this scene
And the three piece suit's still a three piece suite
Yeah I spin a man, I Billy Jean these beats
A man wanna chat about TP3, that's a next ting
Over the fence ting
Be a chopper, crossbar, BMX ting
St Olaves on a belt drive decks ting, sept ting ?
I kept money in a box that my creps come in
Before my first Wiley cheque come in
So what, them man are flexing?
Them man are keyboard flexing?
Well, your girl's pum pum stinks like the A13 Beckton exit
Wanna get immature? We can gets petty
We don't do Twitter wars, you can get slept quick
Wanna get old school, we can get sket shit
But New Banger's on deck shit
I'm so ghetto, my bredrin wazza might tip off my electric
Now I got the fucking car from Scalextric
Party on, we don't rave with no dead tings
Dark and red skin, get me, it's a
Gyaldem ting, gyaldem ting (Mad!)
Box of the Rosé, champs and ting
Badman ting
Which-which man are on a badman ting?
Must have been chest day, Smithy
Abs and ting
Leng it down, leng it down
I will come to your shubs and, leng it down
White-boy wasted, Gazza’d out
Two gun-fingers
Garage Skank

And I will come to your Bar Mitzvah and, leng it down
I will come to your holy communion and, leng it down
I will come to your hen do and
