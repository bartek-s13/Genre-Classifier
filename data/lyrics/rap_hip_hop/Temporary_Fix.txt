Temporary fix yeah
Take another sip ay yeah, yeah
Take another trip yeah
This good as it gets oh yeah, yeah
I would love to switch yeah
It’s just what it is oh yeah, yeah
If you can relate to me we gon all get through this shit oh yeah, yeah

Tell me something that I don’t know
Show me something I ain’t seen before
She say I should get out more
But I keep staring at the floor
Thinking bout all the time wasted
Thinking bout my peoples tryna save me
Chose the wrong path and I paved it
Praying that my life won’t cave in

I find therapy in all the wrong things
I can’t blame nobody that shit is on me
Wish my family thought me how to talk it out, (taught me how to talk it out)
When I try, I don’t know what to talk about, (don’t know where to start what to talk about)

It’s just what it is oh yeah yeah
If you can relate to me we gon all get through this shit oh yeah yeah
Everything in this world overwhelms me
Shawty always tellin me to get healthy
All I’m thinking bout is how to get wealthy
Even though I know that shit not gon help me, help me
Lost with you that’s my favorite place
When you ask what’s wrong wish I had something to say
Might be something going wrong wit my brain
Wish I could stay out my own way
(Pre hook)
I find therapy in in all the wrong things
I can’t blame nobody that shit is on me
Wish my family thought me how to talk it out, (taught me how to talk it out)
When I try, I don’t know what to talk about, (don’t know where to start what to talk about)
