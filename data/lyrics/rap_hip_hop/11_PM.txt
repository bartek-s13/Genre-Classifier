I’m so familiar with the hustle, so it’s just comes as second nature
Always been the one they run to when they ask for favors
Phone blowing up got me wishing I had a pager
It’s all goody I just do it and I never say much
Most the time just wanna stay in my zone
I ask her why you tryna play with my phone
That’s how it goes, You prolly think that I’m texting girls from the places I roam
But I just been in the studio like I made it my home
This pain that I wrote, you prolly can relate to this shit
I rarely upload, that’s cos I’m barely taking em pics
They asking how the music going I’m just patient with it
Been in my own lane so I don't gotta stay in the mix
And I ain’t really got the time these days
I grind these days
We put in overtime just tryna find this cake
Wrote this in the cloud I just flew in and out 3 states
And I been steady cooking up you tell me how this taste
It’s mic check just gotta kill it I been so vicious
It’s no feelings, got the lines for you like coke dealers
I roll different, all I know is just go get it
And most times if it ain’t henny then I won’t sip it
Getting faded off of something I rolled
Out in Hollywood where they prolly would come for my soul
Been all about the music that’s the only comfort I know
I wonder how she putting up with all the flaws that I show
A couple good girls lately and I think I’m getting used to those
How you burning bridges and lately you tryna use a boat
Gotta be in conversations arguing bout who the GOAT
Cos they telling me I’m patiently waiting for you to blow
Gimme a minute. I’m just spilling my feelings
Lotta cheese in my denims
So ain’t no killing my rhythm
Gotta keep me a distance from suckas all in my business
Wondering how I did it, I’m focused been on a mission
Took a lotta heat so I got used to cooling off fumes
Always did it when they prolly thought I wouldn’t come thru
Got expensive taste so you know I’d do the plush view
Independent but it’s guaranteed I’m putting up views
