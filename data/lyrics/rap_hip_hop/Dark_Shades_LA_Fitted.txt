By Jay Blaze (Prod. By Trigue)
Intro:
Light, Light, Light Up
Hey (3x)
It’s got like a 2 step on it
Light, Light, Light Up (3x)
West Coast
Major
(Chorus)
Dark Shades, LA Fitted (3x)
Lame Niggas, Can’t do this
(We are not the same) (3x)
Dark Shades, LA Fitted
Lame Niggas, Can’t do this
(We are not the same)
Verse 1:
Why do niggas keep actin’ like
The verse they write
Keep em’ on a flight
Booked 50 racks a night
From LA to across the ocean
All I had to do is put the plan in motion
We Global Now
Gotta Global Sound
Fast line game
No breaks to slow us down
You and your whole army
Couldn’t hold us down
My birth in this game
Watched like an Ultra Sound
Getting’ showered with gift
Now they ask when
I never hear and If
Shine so bright
Spark like an end of a spliff
If I didn’t have skills
How would you end up with this
Why compare me to him
No comparison
Why compare me to him
It ain’t fair to him
Why compare me to him
Shits embarrassing
We heating up
Add a match and some kerosene

(Chorus)
Dark Shades, LA Fitted (3x)
Lame Niggas, Can’t do this
(We are not the same) (3x)
Dark Shades, LA Fitted
Lame Niggas, Can’t do this
(We are not the same)

Verse 2:
I think too much
I drink too much
I drank a bunch
That what it was
I think I haven’t drink enough
I think I haven’t blinked enough
Toast, Yo
Welcome to the West Coast
That shits obligatory
Got a story
Here it goes yo
Walk like I’m in slo mo
Up like I’m on No doz
1 Doz 2 Doz
Damn we on everything
And don’t remember anything
So we gon’ Mr. Freeze it
Make this party last forever
Done I don’t believe it
Why you wanna leave this
Weed and the beaches
Super fake titties
Honking horns in a V – 6
It’s crazy
It’s beautiful
Intelligent
And full of fool you might win and Oscar
Or drown in a kiddy pool
Ya my eye are blood shot
Hand over dark shades
Don’t worry why there like this
Damn I gotta call BLAZE
WTF did we do
How’d I get a Seadoo
Some chic is making pancake
I’ll holla when I see you

(Chorus)
Dark Shades, LA Fitted (3x)
Lame Niggas, Can’t do this
(We are not the same) (3x)
Dark Shades, LA Fitted
Lame Niggas, Can’t do this
(We are not the same)
