<<<<<<< HEAD
She wanna hang with the goons
She wanna party midnight till noon
She wanna play with my tool
Wanna rock all my jewels
She wanna see a different life she never knew
I think she find it cool, I think she find it cool
She said Burna babe I had my eyes on you
She showed me a good time but now I gotta move
The money callin' baby girl now I gotta move

Gotta keep it groovin’
I gotta keep it groovin'
Can't let no ho’ fuck my grind nigga I ain't stupid
These hunneds on my mind you know i'ma get to it
I need my wrist to shine more, fuck, I need to lose it
Rollin' with some loose screws
Fuck around put a nigga on the news
Thirty shots in the fifth, sixteen in the neen
Told bro still bring the deuce deuce
Bro gon' jump out act a fool
Bro gon' hop out act a fool
Caught him lackin' outside, he should've stayed in school
In my city keep a tool
Lil’ nigga you know the rules
’cause niggas grimy
They just wanna see you fuckin' lose
They wanna see a nigga lose
They don’t wanna see you winnin'
Prayin' that the lord put a nigga in position
To take care of my people, tell her i'm in the kitchen
I gotta get that bag, they keep tellin’ me i'm gified
Every bird must go
We rockin' Monclers in the bando
Big bro steady cookin', workin' magic by the stove
It's too potent gotta cover up my nose
Breakin' down O's, fiends buzzed the house phone
We don't buzz'em in if we don't fuckin' know
Percies or some ratio, i'm so high i'm in my zone
I don't wanna hate nigga just leave me alone
Man, she won't leave me alone
She won't let me leave the dope
She wanna explore, she wanna see more
Is she ridin'? I don't know
Let her transport all the dope
Count up all the cake, let her count up all the dough
For the gang I ride fo'sho
Jump inside that four door
My youngin circle around, trap around like the store
Foreign cars, foreign clothes
This the life he can't afford
She say she ain't never ever seen this life before

She wanna hang with the goons
She wanna party midnight till noon
She wanna play with my tool
Wanna rock all my jewels
She wanna see a different life she never knew
I think she find it cool, I think she find it cool
She said Burna babe I had my eyes on you
She showed me a good time but now I gotta move
