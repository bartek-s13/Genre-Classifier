I don't think you know what I go through
Just tryna put a smile up on ya face
Say I don't think you know what I go through
Just tryna make sure that you living great
You don't appreciate, all you do is complain
Put my freedom on the line, they can take it all away
All you gotta do is wait
And we gon' make it, all you gotta do is wait

I'm over here, you over there
I ain't picking up my phone, I know you scared
I'm grinding hard in the stu'
I'm always there
Don't always tell you what I do, I know you care
But I'm just trying get the bag, I know its there
I sent you out to get a bag and do ya hair
I know you figured that it's sad and it ain't fair
But if a nigga get you mad, you know I'm there
So baby you should trust me, you fucking with a star
Girl you lucky
You would, you would be a fool if you dub me
I just came out here looking busty so I'm getting money
Bitches wanna fuck me, and you should understand
If you love me that I'm just trying do the best I can
I got caught up in the moment the one night stands
The one night stands but-
I'ma ride, I'ma ride for you
I'ma, I'ma, I'ma ride for you
I'ma ride for you, I'ma always find time for you
That's why I find time for you
I mean, obvious that I'ma ride with you
But if you playing I ain't trying waste no time with you
Keep it real then I get on my grind with you
But understand that I'm gon' do what I gotta do
My mindset way different from a lot of dudes
Running late, I make sure you get a ride to school
Nah not lying to you, not lying to you
I'ma always find time for you, ah

Man slow down, speed it up, slow it down, speed it up
Matter fact, lay down, lemme eat it up
Pu punani with strawberry, it’s a decent lunch
And I can take you out to dinner if you wanna meal
Lay back, Netflix, if you trying chill
I treat you like you wifey so you know its real
And I'll kill a nigga for you girl, you know I will
And I'll kill a nigga for you girl, you know I will

I remember in the crib, you was showing me the tricks
And your spits made a nigga wanna kid
I was rolling that spliff while you riding my dick
Feel ashamed that I came that quick
Now you got me reminiscing 'bout the days I miss
Other hoes play a part but they ain't my bitch
They just wanna see us ruin our relationship
Swear they wanna see us ruin our relationship
But I love them good vibes, that's what I deserve
Even though sometimes you irk me and you get on my nerves
I could always make it better when I lift up ya skirt
It surfs, yeah getting busy and I make that thing squirt
Teamwork make the dream work, now I need a clean shirt
Pussy tasted like a Tropicana out the freezer and
When I see you, I know these bitches wanna be you
And they don't even know about that Hurricane Katrina
How I knock it out like we up in the arena
I had them toes curled, but you ain't no ballerina
Yeah that's mine and I love her like my Nina
I keep her looking fly, she might just pass it if you see her
Man slow down, speed it up, slow it down, speed it up
Matter fact, lay down, lemme eat it up
Pu punani with strawberry, it’s a decent lunch
And I can take you out to dinner if you wanna meal
Lay back, Netflix, if you trying chill
I treat you like you wifey so you know its real
And I'll kill a nigga for you girl, you know I will
And I'll kill a nigga for you girl, you know I will

But I don't think you know what I go through
Just tryna put a smile up on ya face
Say I don't think you know what I go through
Just tryna make sure that you living great
You don't appreciate, all you do is complain
Put my freedom on the line, they can take it all away
All you gotta do is wait
And we gon' make it all you gotta do is wait
Wait, wait, wait
Wait, wait, wait
Wait, wait, wait
