Fleshed out from my skin to bones
What it’s like feel depressed and alone?
I feel no pain
Do it all the same way
Wake up every morning
Realize we all doin’ the same thing
Yeah
I go out from time to time just to clear my mental
Gotta stay on the timeline
I’m droppin’ somethin’ special
Something different from your average rapper
A little bit of spice mixed in with your cloudy weather
I know you hot but I’m a trend setter
No one else like me as far as the eye can see
I can see
I’m the only motherfucker who wanna be different
Everybody else just followin’ the same system

‘Cause I been tellin’ you baby that it’s all for me
Stayin’ up late, makin’ music, smokin’ trees
Because I’m free
Only body to impress is me
Not worried ‘bout the other people you see
So stick around for a while
And vibe with my style
Don’t need nobody to get mobile
Been on this bike since I was 15
I been ridin’ these waves
So let a kid dream
Yeah
I stay cooped up inside with nothin’ else to do
Just music on my mind
See, I don’t do it for you
Yeah I do it for the crew
Think this song’s about who?
Nah, I’m just playin’ with you
Don’t shed a tear now
Just tremble in fear
Of what I’m gonna say
Targets on your back, it could be any day
I hope to stay to the back of your mind
That’s how I’ve been all my life
Like a movie, put that shit on rewind
I’m sorry to take up your time
But you know I’m on my grind
So don’t interrupt a workin’ mind now (mind now)
It’s time to send a message to y’all
I ain’t a dog no more
Yeah, my future is tall
Taller than you’ve ever been
Newest name on the scene
I know it’s time to come clean
The way I do it so obscene
‘Cause it’s too late
Fired off your shots and now it’s my turn
You’re gonna feel what it’s like to crash and burn
Never your concern
I’ve changed a lot over these past couple ticks
Like Weightwatchers, I was takin’ before and after pics
Before I was just a man with a voice that could sing
But, soon enough, they’ll be hoisting me like I’m the king
So just let a kid dream
The rings all ring out
Burn out, cave in
Blackened to dark out
I'm mixed now, fleshed out
There's light with no heat
We cooled out, it's cool out
Life is precious
We found out, we found out
