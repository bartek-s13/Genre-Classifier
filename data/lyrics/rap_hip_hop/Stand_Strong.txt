I walk around town with the pound strapped down
That's only because it's mad real in Bucktown
It gets mad deep in the streets
When you gotta watch your back
For beasts, enemies, even your peeps
(I step to my business stand strong on my own two
Do what I have to do to get through
If you for real then you know the deal)
I do or die (and I never ran never will)

Daybreak sneaks upon my camp once more
Niggas drowning in blackness stretched on the floor
Breakfast is served, the killer dealer from the Stuy
All bwoy go heaven but no bwoy want die
Watch the thin line nuff rap and reality
Get yourself hurt even cause fatal casualties
See, let me explain this ain't no game
The words you talk'll have you coming right up out your frame
You understand where I'm coming from, slim
Bucktown's the state of mind that I'm trapped in
If you want to see me, have some sensi
Keep your actions real everything will be irie
Wicked minded youth dem'll lick off a shot
Cause the roots silly around my way to get hot
Had to relocate, update with my inner
Build and destroy when I step in the center
Of the cipher in the night, wool rolled tight
Boot Camp Click no doubt that's right
Now you singing a sad hymn, asking me to stop them
From throwing away your sloppy double chinned husband
Mr Ripper I got lyrics out the Timbs
Hurt their pride so bad make you never talk again
And you call yourself a man, I cram to understand
Never step into your business less you got a clan
I walk around town with the pound strapped down
That's only because it's mad real in Bucktown
It gets mad deep in the streets
When you gotta watch your back
For beasts, enemies, even your peeps
(I step to my business stand strong on my own two
Do what I have to do to get through
If you for real then you know the deal)
I do or die (and I never ran never will)

When I come around the block
I give mad love to the heads that I know
While the heads that I don't know watch
As I step to my business they witness me
Constantly building with my family
Jealously makes them enemies
So when them nah step correct me and my Tek'll put an end to the
Individuals who choose to use life for granted
What you gwan do when it's demanded
Will your boys leave you stranded in the midst
Of a battle where you get that ass shattered at your own risk
I hope y'all niggas get it right this time
Cause in this life of mine I'm going out for crime
And I believe, you got to take what you want to achieve
Some do have tricks up them sleeves
(But we) crack down on the wack found back 'round Bucktown
Get down if you're with the now
Cause what's happening there's a whole lot of flapping
But watch what'll happen when we bring Gunn Clappaz in
Boot Camp organize in the streets
In the industry on the rise with my peeps
But don't sleep cause you only manage to gain
A mental block on your brain or a Glock to your frame
Basic training, Boot Camp don't let shit slide
So we be ready for what be on the brick side
I walk around town with the pound strapped down
That's only because it's mad real in Bucktown
It gets mad deep in the streets
When you gotta watch your back
For beasts, enemies, even your peeps
(I step to my business stand strong on my own two
Do what I have to do to get through
If you for real then you know the deal)
I do or die (and I never ran never will)
Straight like that Beatminerz for your chrome
Yeah, better recognize
