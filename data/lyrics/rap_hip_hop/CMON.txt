If the Uber gets banned
How my Enfield tings gon' cope?
Cah they don't know a thing about trams
But in a heartbeat still wan' stroke
I rev the Range Rove' bare gas
And now my Croydon ting wan' loaf
We hit the dance then leave all smash
We soon blow then we champagne toast
Come on come on

Uni girls left me for Tion
And now they wanna know what we on
Ching ching, make em all pree pree on
Can't call me 'H' call me 'Leon'
Hey, looks ain't my USP
But I got a hundred racks on my USB
My white bruddahs doing up UFC
Stepped in with the gang lookin' USG

I don't even talk
Every gal wan' wuk off for me
In the dance and they bruk out for me
Push their back out for me
No  now they cat out for me
Straight racks we don't step out for free
(Come on come on)
We don't play no games with them
All of them wan' play pretend
We don't play no games with them
All of them wan' play pretend
They love me
I know they won't say they do
You know their man feel a way
You tell by the way they move

Couple gal left me for Hardz
Cause they saw him and Ace in the charts
They be givin' good brain to the stars
Back stage at the shows and dance

Sometimes I'm flexy
Hilfiger and a denim shirt got me sexy
Navy drop, red hate got me pepsi
Now tings from my spot can't get me
You get me?

Those days we were chillin' on the corner
Now the Range Rove' round the corner
Broke days when we couldn't stack a one up
Now we star hard we not suffer
We tellin' 'em to
Boat with me that's if you fuck with me
Broke women your money ain't talk to me
Those days we were chillin' on the corner
Now the Range Rove' round the corner
I rev the Range Rove' bare gas
And now my Croydon ting wan' loaf
We hit the dance then leave all smash
We soon blow then we champagne toast
And if the Uber gets banned
How my Enfield tings gon' cope?
Cah they don't know a thing about trams

Come on

We don't play no games with them
All of them wan' play pretend
We don't play no games with them
All of them wan' play pretend

You know their man feel a way
You tell by the way they move
They love me
I know they won't say they do
You know their man feel a way
You tell by the way they move
