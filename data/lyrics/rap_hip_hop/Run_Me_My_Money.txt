Let me tell you a little something 'bout me
I'm a boss bitch straight up out the 313
The only thing on my mind is getting rich
I go hard on a nigga &amp; a bitch like
Run me my money
Nigga run me my money
Bitch run me my money
I go hard on a nigga and a bitch like
Run me my money
Nigga run me my money
Bitch run me my money

Yeah, Kash Doll in this bitch nigga
Fuck a hating ass bitch and a bitch nigga
Plus I made 30 racks last week
Niggas mad cause my wrist on fleek
Man I don't give a fuck, yeah I'm all about my paper
Can catch me OT out in Cali in my scrapper
But back in the D I'm ice wetting on these hoes
It's mink on my back every time I do shows
Cause man now a days hoes hating so hard
But live in a small ass crib, with a ham ass nigga
&amp; some bad ass kids, with a shitty ass car
Drive that bitch everyday to your shitty ass job (Haha)
Yeah, Boss up bitch
I'm getting money I don't care about the cost, bitch
Jada Pinkett in the booth, Set It Off, bitch
I'm getting money I'll never take a loss bitch
And while I'm at fuck a nigga too
Can give a fuck what a nigga say, a nigga do
Talking big bout his car and his crib
But it's a damn shame he don't do for his kids
But at the same time, online straight flexing and shit
Taking pictures of his money fake texting and shit
Have you ever heard of me?
Well my name Is Kash Doll
Nice to meet you, by the way, I'm next in this bitch!
