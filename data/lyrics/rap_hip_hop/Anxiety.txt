At some point we gotta talk, I'd rather save it for later
I feel like I need another, I'm afraid I won't wake up
Anxiety killing me, now I'm not afraid to wake up
Yeah I know we gotta talk, I'd rather save it for later
At some point we gotta talk, I'd rather save it for later
I feel like I need another, I'm afraid I won't wake up
Anxiety killing me, now I'm not afraid to wake up
Yeah I know we gotta talk, I'd rather save it for later

Need you here with me right now because I'm feeling down, yeah
All up in my head, baby, I hate feeling so down, yeah
Thought this shit was fake but now I know what you're about, yeah aye
I don't even want to talk right now, yeah
I'm all alone when I feel this shit, girl, imma call up your phone
Late at night, I want to talk so I don't feel alone
Losing track of time, I don't know, I don't know
When I roll around I think

I want to go back in time
Back when I felt fine
I just need one more try
Baby, you're on my mind

At some point we gotta talk, I'd rather save it for later
I feel like I need another, I'm afraid I won't wake up
Anxiety killing me, now I'm not afraid to wake up
Yeah I know we gotta talk, I'd rather save it for later
At some point we gotta talk, I'd rather save it for later
I feel like I need another, I'm afraid I won't wake up
Anxiety killing me, now I'm not afraid to wake up
Yeah I know we gotta talk, I'd rather save it for later

Got this pressure in my chest, let me call you up, really need to vent right now
Fine when I get faded but starts trippin' when I'm coming down
Sick of feeling sick from all this shit, so baby hit me up
Trapped inside my mind and I'm alright 'till it starts heading south
Something, take this pain away, Somebody
I could feel ok 'till the morning
I don't know myself no more it haunts me
When it's getting late and I’m all alone
Oh I ain’t asking much, I just need some peace of mind
I been feeling lost the way out I can’t find
And it got me heavy, breathing, praying for sleep, yeah
Falling off the deep end

I want to go back in time
Back when I felt fine
I just need one more try
Baby, you're on my mind

At some point we gotta talk I’d rather save it for later
I feel like I need another I'm afraid I won't wake up
Anxiety killing me now I'm not afraid to wake up
