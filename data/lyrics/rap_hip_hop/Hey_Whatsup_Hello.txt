Wanna talk for a minute?
Wanna talk for a minute?
Hey what's up hello
Hey what's up hello I wanna talk for a minute
I'm gettin dirty money been a boss for a minute
Pulled up in a limo with the windows tinted
No iced out pendant I'm fresh I don't pretend it
Then they let me in cut the line (VIP)
Snapchat stories gotta post that on my timeline
Gotta hit the green room just to get my mind right
Got it on my rider so I gotta have my Klondikes
Ooh, wore this so you'd think I look cool
All about my rhymes never liked haiku
Never liked these dudes act too cool
Now I got it poppin they all know me at my school
Now I gotta rock it
Spit venom in these denim
Tell her pucker up like she suckin on a lemon
Baby I'm the teacher and today I'm the lesson
Just forget your stress and
Come here when I beckon
Hey what's up hello I wanna talk for a minute
I'm gettin dirty money been a boss for a minute
I ain't gotta rent it no cost when I'm in it
Voss for my women
Top, I ain't spinnin
Oooh ain't sayin I got it like that
I am only sayin that they doubted white rap
If I lost the money I would get it right back
Man she got a booty I would hit it like slap
Oohh gotta say what's up to you
On a scale of A to Z you a W
And this is A to B so see your way out
These bitches love games so don't get played out
Hey what's up hello I wanna talk for a minute
I'm gettin dirty money been a boss for a minute
All up in the slot like floss I'm the dentist
My bitch is independent, I'm living in the present
Oh-my-god, 3 mollys!
She lick me, like lollies
Eat my greens, like broccoli
Jump up on the uh like an ollie
Oooh gotta eat my veggie become spiderman
Magic with the wrist I guess I got the sleight of hand
I watch out for my health I gotta have my vitamins
I gotta get this wealth, money talk I understand
Please
Speak my language (Money talk)
I been getting dirty money tryna pull up in the Range rich
When I'm tryna eat I don't need a banquet
Need a bad bitch that can make a sandwich
Hey what's up hello I wanna talk
Hey what's up hello I wanna talk
Hey whats up hello
Hey whats up hello
