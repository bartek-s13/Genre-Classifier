<<<<<<< HEAD
FEEL LIKE SOME NEW LOVE IN YOUR MEDULLA
WE GOT NEW GAMES TO PLAY WE NEVER KNEW OF
I DON'T NEED NO OTHER GIRL THEY DON'T GET THE TIME OF DAY
NEVER TAKING TIME AWAY FROM YOU MAKE YOU RUN AWAY
I REALLY WASN'T THINKIN MOMMA
I NEVER WANNA BRING YOU DRAMA
NOW YOU'RE LOOKING AT ME DIFFERENT
I KNOW I SOUND CRAZY RIGHT NOW
I DON'T WANNA LOOSE YOU GIRL
IM SO SERIOUS GO DELERIOUS
THIS SHIT COULD RUIN THE WORLD
I COULD BE FRONTIN LIKE ENOUGH IS ENOUGH
BUT YOU LOVE ME AND FUCK ME SO GOOD
WE JUST STUNTIN WE SHOULD
ME IN MY ZONE YOU IN NEXT TO NOTHING
SEX WITHOUT JUDGEMENT
AND IF WE LIKE IT WE DO IT
CONNECTION SO STRONG WE GET THROUGH IT
I'M JEALOUS AS HELL I KNOW YOU ARE TOO
I THINK WE COULD USE IT AND FREAK IT
AND SHOW YOU THE THINGS YOU'D FORGET YOU'D BE LOOSING
TAKE OUR TIME ADDRESS IT LOVE
IT'S SENSITIVE FINESSE IT GOOD (I SAY)
TELL ME THINGS YOU USUALLY WOULDN'T (DOIN WHAT WE DO)
DO THINGS ONLY BEST FRIENDS COULD (YOU'RE MY)
FEEL LIKE SOME NEW LOVE THAT'S HOW WE DO US
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO PLAY IF THAT'S WHAT YOU DO LOVE
YOU DON'T GET NO OTHER GIRL
SHE DON'T GET NO TIME OF DAY
NEVER TAKING TIME AWAY FROM ME
BOY YOU MUST BE CRAZY
YOU REALLY WASN'T THINKIN WAS YOU
BUT I WON'T HOLD THAT AGAINST YOU
I KNOW YOU MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT
I'M GLAD YOU DIDN'T ACT UPON IT
YOU DON'T WANNA LOOSE ME BOY I'M SO SERIOUS
I'M REALLY SERIOUS THIS SHIT COULD RUIN THE WORLD
I COULD BE FRONTIN LIKE ENOUGH IS ENOUGH
BUT YOU LOVE ME AND FUCK ME SO GOOD
WE JUST STUNTIN WE SHOULD
ME IN MY ZONE YOU IN NEXT TO NOTHING
SEX WITHOUT JUDGEMENT
AND IF WE LIKE IT WE DO IT
CONNECTION SO STRONG WE GET THROUGH IT
I'M JEALOUS AS HELL I KNOW YOU ARE TOO
I THINK WE COULD USE IT AND FREAK IT
AND FUCK LET'S DO IT MOMMA LET'S GET TO IT
TAKE OUR TIME ADDRESS IT LOVE
