<<<<<<< HEAD
Woke up feelin' good so it's thanks I give
I never been shot, an never did a bid
So I reckon it’s the right day, after Friday
So I call up my homes (yeah man, what chu' say?)
I told me we bout to have a barbecue
So pick up some ice and bring the chronic through
The homegirls down the street went to the swap meet
To get some more chicks they’ll be back at three
So we break out the bones and get to slappin’ em down
We got doo wah diddy pumping surround sound
It’s a lovely day and I feel like Bill Withers
Food stacked on the plate, mad lunch and dinner
The neighborhoods chilled as the sun goes down
Niggas getting tipsy and begin to clown
But we all just laughin’, eatin’, coolin’
Givin’ high fives talking ‘bout the old schoolin’
Sending BGs to the store for blunts
I dedicate this song to the first of the month
We might wake up and try to do it again
Yo that's how it goes down, that's the city  I'm in. So-
You bring the beef and I'll bring the brew
Oh shit anotha barbecue
You bring the links and I'll bring the brew
Oh shit anotha barbecue
You bring the wings and I'll bring the brew
Oh shit anotha barbecue
You bring the ladies and I'll bring the brew
Oh shit anotha barbecue
At my crib I got three barbecues
One I keep upstairs for daily use
But downstairs pumping out eighty thousand BTUs
Don’t get it confused I bring the beef to you
(ay ay homie don’t touch my grill) Got it under control
Flip meat like I flip beats cooked with soul
Only use the best ingredients available
That’s my word, they're cooking turds over Kingsford
Charcoal but ain't goin' out like that
Tortillas and corn and we can all get fat
And if you want another plate, get you some more
Hey, the dog’ll eat whatever meat falls on the floor
Empty handed new jacks back to the store, hit the shelf
And don’t bring back beer your gonna drink yourself
Now putting Laser in the cooler, making the switch
Then I see you drinking my Coopers, son of a bitch
That’s the ol' one-two but homie it’s all good
It’s an L.A. thang and that’s understood
It’s the same ol’ barbecue, but man it’s all good
It’s just an L.A. thang and that’s understood so-
You bring the beef and I'll bring the brew
Oh shit anotha barbecue
You bring the links and I'll bring the brew
Oh shit anotha barbecue
You bring the wings and I'll bring the brew
Oh shit anotha barbeque
You bring the ladies and I'll bring the brew
Oh shit anotha barbecue
Oh shit anotha barbecue
Oh shit anotha barbecue
Hey why you always having so many barbecues man?
I mean it’s good an all but oh shit
I’m sure you gonna have another one tomorrow, right, next week, week after that?
What, you gonna make a song about it or something?
Barbecue barbecue b-b-b-barbecue
B-b-barbecue bar-de-de-bar-de-de-barbecue (Yeah)
Yeah a b-b-barbecue
Awww shit anotha barbecue
