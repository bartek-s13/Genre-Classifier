In my head, she said it's all in my head (My head)
But it's not, think I'd rather be dead (Be dead)
Can't forgive or forget what you did (You did)
She said I drove her away with my emotions (I drove her away)
Can't take the pain anymore, I'm feeling hopeless (Can't take the pain)
In my head, she said it's all in my head (My head)
But it's not, think I'd rather be dead (Be dead)
Can't forgive or forget what you did (You did)

I don't even know why I try
You did me wrong
And I can't forget that
Tell me what you want
I know it's a lie (Lie)
You broke my heart
And you cannot fix that
You can't erase what you've done to me
But certainly, all you do is burden me
It's hurting deep
Our past is like a blur to me
It's hard to see, but look what you have done to me

What you want?
What you want from me?
What you want?
What you want from me?
What you want?
What you want from me?
