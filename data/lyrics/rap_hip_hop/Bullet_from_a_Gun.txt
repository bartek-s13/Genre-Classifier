Big Smoke, SK LEVEL, greaze
Listen

Like a bullet from a gun, it burns
When you realise she was never your girl
It was just your turn
You gotta face your demons
Don't matter how much money you earn
Your niggas said 4L
But the shit got real and you weren't concerned
The same old story, the world spins 'round and 'round, fam
Lessons have to get learned

Truth has to be told
I don't bend, I don't fold
I lost count how many we sold
I went Silver, I went Gold
Then I went Platinum, so what's next?
Supermodels tryna sex
Sendin' nudes on a text
Can't believe I used to be vexed
See, it's too easy
To write a sad song about how my dad raised me
'Cause I'm lookin' in the mirror and my dad made me
A real top boy, I just can't play the victim
Been livin' my life as a kingpin
I'm calm with the heat in the kitchen
I was a young boy, mum told me what my name really means
And the power just kicked in
I found my way home
Then I saw my granddad's name on a gravestone
The same as mine, already dead
Nothin' to fear, I been here from time
Chief SK sippin' on palm wine
Every day, I laugh at these niggas online
Another one, here today, gone tomorrow
Dick ridin; for some likes and a follow
Put in the work, that's all you need to bust
Shoutout Lancey, Headie, and J Hus
Shout 67, oh you see them with us
We was on tour, bare weed on the bus
Feds outside, the bus gotta push to the next city, gotta rush
Big plans gettin' discussed, so freedom is a must
Fuck the police, tell 'em, "Eat my dust"
'Cause still it ain't safe, not even in a world full of cops
I got bored of askin', "When is this hurt gonna stop?"
We don't want to conversate or confer with the opps
It is what it is
Recently, I've been learnin' a lot
All I know is there's no better feeling
Than gettin' home and seein' my little girl in a cot, so
This year we're done talkin'
Forget the bagga chat, it's just action
Man are trollin' to get a reaction
Every day, it's another distraction
Gotta fight temptation, can't get lost in the sauce
Have I got a heart? Yeah, of course
But I had to put my feelings on pause
'Cause like a bullet from a gun, it burns
When you realise she was never your girl
It was just your turn
You got to face your demons
Don't matter how much money you earn
Your niggas said 4L
But the shit got real and you weren't concerned
The same old story, the world spins 'round and 'round, fam
Lessons have to get learned
