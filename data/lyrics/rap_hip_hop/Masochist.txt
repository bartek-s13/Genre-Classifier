(Intro Speech)
The term, “masochist,” has evolved to describe persons exhibiting the characteristics of a social disorder evidenced by a pervasive pattern of self-defeating behavior, as well as attraction to and engagement in prolonged exposure to pain, suffering, humiliation, and total domination…
(Verse 1)
No Sean, I ain't talking about the, “blessings,” impressively I press it like a predatory presence
Like a predatory lender wheeling a prime up on the credit, a capital contender dealing a dime out to the peasants
Four scores and seven years ago? I fucking read it, my family still went broke and the banks just got it better
The ninety-nine percent’s a joke I’d rather be vendetta while I front you all and call the hoax and you just put a tent up
Married to the data of our economic strata and I’m giving you the grammar that’s befitting to the canon
A vocabulary casualty that casually I carry like a capillary carries blood its very necessary, yeah its very necessary
What the fuck, Well I’m an emissary representing sensory perception cause I’m sensing your perception is affected by affection to the misery you married
(Chorus)
I think we love our pain, call a protest the past and we still see race
I’m gonna cast my stone while we build class slaves, it’s a real cold case
Of masochists, a bunch of masochists, run around in masks but the fact is this...
Yeah the fact remains… I think we love our pain
(Verse 2)
I’m both a cause and a product of the problem, not a product of the bottom but I promise that I’ll profit if I’ve gotta
Not a fucking prophet when I’m talking to my God, I’m just a conduit at odds with the flock that I’m a part of
If prophecy is property than property, I’ve got it.  My prophecy is poverty? Then Comicon, I’m on it…
Fuck, I guess what I mean is that I’m going kamikaze with my Suicide Squad that I’m bringing right beside me, oh God, oh gee
If I was fucking poor I wouldn’t reach for more, I would live brief, besieged, and inbreed war
If I was fucking middle, play the world’s smallest fiddle, try to play the game while I only get a little
If I was fucking rich I’d fear the most shit, oppress the mids and lows, take no risk
(Chorus Repeats)
(Verse 3)
Yeah we love our pain, saying that we’re different but we’re really the same
Both need a place to stay, a plate to eat, someone to lay, somewhere to sleep
That’s why you fucking see me working fifty hour weeks, fifty hours a week
Just so I can fucking pay for power and heat, just so I can pay for what’s of value to me
Couple hours in a studio, making music beautiful, never fold before the goal
Cause that’s freedom to me, yes that’s freedom to me
Reaching for heights that your likes couldn’t reach that I’ll fight just to keep
Fuck, I’m not a dumb white either, pitching all lives matter while I’m sniffing on the ether
History is written man I wish that we would read it, yeah right motherfucker seeing is believing…
(Chorus Repeats)
(Outro)
We beg for change, yeah we beg for change
When the time comes we refuse to pay…
Its abuse we say….I think we love our pain
