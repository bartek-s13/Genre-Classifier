If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you
Metro

I count the cash through the week (Week)
On a Tesla, I can't go to sleep (Can't go to sleep)
I covered her body with C's (C's)
I'm copping this drip overseas (Copping this drip overseas)
I like when she get on her knees (Yeah)
I'm rocking these VLONE jeans (VLONE jeans)
I need me a fat ass to squeeze (Squeeze)
I promise I look like a king (Yeah)
I told you we all 'bout the cream
My bag is a hundred or more (Hundred or more)
I got this cash off of shows
Left the Jag and I hopped in the Rolls

Ain't rockin' no SI2 (2)
My diamonds VVS
Ain't driving no CRV (Yeah)
My coupe is a GT-S
All the hard times gave me strength (Strength)
So I can carry this money to the bank
Nobody helped me, there's no one to thank
Now they watching the picture I paint
My plug always make sure I'm straight
Not every superhero got a cape
Smoking on Backwoods bad for me
But I don't wan't smoke on a vape (Yeah)
I ain't healthy, but my pockets they in shape (Yeah)
Fucking all these hoes, I'm touring state to state (State to state)
Laying by the pool, your girlfriend feeding me grapes (Feedin' me grapes)
Gotta keep it on me, I got a lot at stake
I was born with all this drip, I came out a faucet (Drip)
When they put my bro in a chain gang, I almost lost it (Almost lost it)
So much jealousy and envy, gotta be cautious (Gotta be cautious)
I made some M's when I surrounded myself with bosses (Bosses)
Had too many flaws, I got my Rolex studded with flawless (Flawless)
Had too much drip, I had to invest into a closet (Closet)
When I poured that 12 inside of a 2, I felt nauseous (Nauseous)
If I pop another Tesla pill, I'ma be car sick (Car sick)

I pulled out the ladder, forgot my roof, thought I lost it (Thought I lost it)
Back then know hate been coming my way, think I dodged it (Think I dodged it)
She call her friend, we fucking in the room, told her fall in (Fall in)
I moved to the pad with a thirty foot drape, nigga we balling (Balling)
Put heat-'em-up floors inside of my room (Room)
Off-White on the side of my shoes (Shoes)
VVS's in all of my jewels (VVS's)
More blessings right after you lose (More blessings)
Ain't stressing, my family cool (Cool)
Different watches, depend on the mood (Mood)
Lotta shopping with Fendi and Gucc' (Gucc')
They be watching my grind like the news (Watching my grind like the news)
I'ma chop out the pen with the crew (Crew)
No mechanic, but I keep a tool (Ah)
Gunna got hoes by the twos (Got hoes by the twos)
Up the stick and don't nobody move (No)
She be eating my dick like it's food (Food)
She a freak and she still go to school (Yeah)
I put that bitch in a groove (Groove)
Me and NAV stack that cash to the roof
I was born with all this drip, I came out a faucet (Drip)
When they put my bro in a chain gang, I almost lost it (Almost lost it)
So much jealousy and envy, gotta be cautious (Gotta be cautious)
I made some M's when I surrounded myself with bosses (Bosses)
Had too many flaws, I got my Rolex studded with flawless (Flawless)
Had too much drip, I had to invest into a closet (Closet)
When I poured that 12 inside of a 2, I felt nauseous (Nauseous)
If I pop another Tesla pill, I'ma be car sick (Car sick)

I spend a mortgage on my clothes, now I'm balling (I'm balling)
Girl, I'm tryna fuck right now, no time for stalling (Stalling)
I just got a walk-in closet to put the mall in (Mall in)
My whip so close to the floor, you gotta fall in (It's foreign)
I stopped wearing Levi's, now it's Balmains (Balmain)
Every time you see me, I'm with the same gang (Same gang)
I'm tryna get a hundred mill', fuck tryna maintain (Maintain)
Pour me up another six, I'm killing all pain (Killing all pain)
