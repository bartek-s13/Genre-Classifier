<<<<<<< HEAD
Last night, Henny, I’m bent
No text back, you left me on read
You don’t pay no mind to what I said
I’m better off in my own head, yeah
I’m chillin' with my set
I want it all not less (than)
Couple shots 'til I drop dead
I've  been up still with no rest, yeah (aye)
She got everything, yeah right (aye)
Drop that shit before you ride
Eyes low, baby she wanna be up in the ride with me
Drive slow, hmm, yeah

She got it all alone tonight
I wrote this song, hope you answering me
I want you all
I’ll give you all of me, yeah
Damn shawty, Ride slow
Poppin', she all on me
Drop it slow, girl you fine
Girl you fine, all on me
Damn shawty, ride it slow
Poppin', she all on me
Drive slow, girl you fine
Girl you fine, all on me
Let me take pictures with the back showing
Oh, I won’t say shit, yeah
Have fun talking basic, relation
She moves like the matrix, yeah
Sorry if I’m off the same shit
Back to basics yeah, Lil shawty
I’m tryna find the patients with you
I don’t wanna change shit 'bout you

I don’t talk, don’t let it out, aye
I’m gonna go to the bar now, yeah
I’m just tryna let it out, yeah
I don’t wanna talk now, yeah
I don’t talk, don’t let it out, aye
I’m gonna go to the bar now, yeah
I’m just tryna let it out, yeah
