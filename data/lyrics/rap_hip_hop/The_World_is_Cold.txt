[Chorus}
Truth be told, truth be told
I don't know on my soul who riding with me
(Oh i don't know!)
The world is cold , grab a coat, tug and go,on my toes as I fight with the breeze..
(Oh!)
The world is cold
Deep down in the trenches
You know the world is cold
When you hating in your spirit
Boy yo' Homeboy quick to fold
Switch up in minute
Aye the world is out control but we just living in it ..

Watch your right then your left when you on this road...
Riding In the wild you'll collide with your foes ...
Niggas dying in the wild, can't survive in the fold
And they Going out sad , going out broke..
(All i See)
Is violence why when I ride
Fireworks light the city up 4th of July
Fall in dirt ain't no healing them
Think they'll take the signs , get out or die!
Get out or die!
Is you riding or nah?
Make up your mind
Is you riding or nah , what you mean you can't decide ?
Is you riding or na ?
Stop wasting time , stop wasting mine !

[Chorus}
Truth be told, truth be told
I don't know on my soul who riding with me
(Oh i don't know!)
The world is cold , grab a coat, tug and go,on my toes as I fight with the breeze..
(Oh!)
The world is cold
Deep down in the trenches
You know the world is cold
When you hating in your spirit
Boy yo' Homeboy quick to fold
Switch up in minute
Aye the world is out control but we just living in it ..

Hard to accept, to accept when you don't have chains
All that hate in ya heart pumpin' all through yo veins
Nigga Link up a mission, Snatch a chain for some fame..
You can have that chain , and every other thang
R.I.P X man that nigga was the best..
Aye im riding with the Gotti,cause I cannot end up next..
Hey! no one fucks with jxhhny and I think that is best
Aye these people out here cunning and I already said ..

Truth be told, truth be told
I don't know on my soul who riding with me
The world is cold , grab a coat, tug and go,on my toes as I fight with the breeze..
The world is cold
Deep down in the trenches
And You know the world is cold
I see hating in your spirit
Boy yo' Homies quick to fold
Switch up in minute

[Chorus}
Truth be told, truth be told

You know the world is cold
