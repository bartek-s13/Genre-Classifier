(VERSE 1)
I need everybody to circle the table
(AYO-OH)
To all my niggas with more numbers than cable
(AYO-OH)
To all my bitches who don't care for a label
(AYO-OH)
Can everyone pick up a drink from the table
(AYO-AH)
Up, up and we ready for war
(AYO-AH)
And if there's a problem we pressing the call
(AYO-AH)
I guess every story is a lesson for all
(AYO-AH)
I guess every sing is a blessing for all
Reaching again, you niggas is reaching again
Fuck is you leeching again?
Blood on the stool, crips and bloods in a school
Fuck is you teaching to them
I see no one, I see no- I see no one
But niggas is creeping again
I crush the world with my hands
Wait, hold up
(CHORUS)
SHUT THE FUCK UP WHEN I'M MAKING A TOAST
(AYO-OH)
If niggas can't hang than we hand them a rope
(AYO-OH)
SHUT THE FUCK UP WHEN I'M MAKING A TOAST
(AYO)
No man left behind, no checks are signed, I stand beside my niggas
My bitches

No man left behind, I stand beside my niggas
I love my bitches
But I need my money
No man left behind I stand beside it all
