Hook:
I'm getting lil' money I'm feeling so nervous
The police behind me it's making me nervous
These bitches can't trust em' they make me so nervous
They plotting and lurking they making me nervous
They making me nervous just bought a new Glock cuz I tweak when I'm nervous
I'm down the way with some thots and they making me nervous
I feel like a star when I'm counting my money I start getting nervous
My jewelry on me I don't hang out in public I start feeling nervous
Verse:
I got some thots in New York and New Jersey
Yeah bitch I'm Lil Kei &amp; I know that you heard of me
You thinkin' bout robbing me you gone' need surgery
Them bullets gone heat his ass just like a 3rd degree
When I'm out of town it be lit and that's word to me
Don't answer my phone unless it's an emergency
9/10 if i fuck her she slurping me
I'm texting yo bitch &amp; you thinkin' she curving me
I'm getting lil money I'm feeling so nervous
I'm ballin' in Philly like Julius Irving
And I'm in New York with them 50's like Curtis
The way I be flexing I do it on purpose
I'm drippin' in Louis &amp; Gucci I'm surfing
She thought I was Herbo cuz how I be swerving
When i walk up in Lennox I swear I start splurging
