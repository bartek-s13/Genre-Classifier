Hah, nigga, I'm from Harlem
It's Porter

I'm from Harlem, so the H just stands for the straight hustlers
It's a jungle, all gorillas, them killers and gun busters
I be ridin' 'round frontin' like Porter on Wilie Burgers
Y'all been fuckin' with them niggas nobody ain't never heard of
TJ Porter, Harlem's finest, I'm bringin' the ol' back
Any drug up in Harlem, my niggas just sold that
And I make this town lit, my nigga, that's cold facts
In the city, anywhere, everybody know that
Spin the block now, when we pullin' up, the top down
Yeah, it's hot now, well, I'm hiding in my sock now
Workin' all year, now they sayin' I'ma pop now
Harlem on lock, I feel like I'm on top now, what?
Jumpin' out the whip with the mink, and I'm straight frontin'
If you talk that talk then my niggas are straight dumpin'
If I make that call then my niggas is all coming
Coming through your block, y'all niggas is off runnin'
Let's talk about Harlem, 55th
Pee-Wee Kirk put up 50 and took a trip
Hot 6th, 42nd to 45th
And Big L, 40 wolves in this shit
Don't forget about Damon, Biggs, and the best out
All them other niggas hatin', I bet they felt left out
3 6, that's the land they cookin' up in the pan
And they cool, what the hell? Cases jumpin' on the van
We a force with it, now we all at the Kingdom
Shots fired, ringin' off, now we all headed home
12 had bang bang, shit was posted up, he had to comb
Cam had the pink Range, Dipset was in the zone
Now let's take it to the east side, nigga, let's talk the facts
Man, they cookouts in they cave, man, they put them on the map
Now it's my block, where you'd see Bob Lemon
Everybody, Kenny Hutch ballin' out with yo hammock
Middle East niggas, off-shore, just call and let me at 'em
With the boys, 3 A.M., then I will be back again
Now it's Piff Unit, know you remember the smiley faces
19 summer games, y'all know that them shits was crazy
Now we on Johnson with it, RIP Lee and John Doe
Tire wire on a bike, yeah, you know how it go
Now we walkin' past the border, headed down to 1st side
RIP Woozy Woo, he was screamin' "Ride out"
Now it's time to take it over, I'm pullin' up in the Maybach
Young boss niggas, they're askin' me where the change at
Pull it out my pocket, I bet them niggas won't take that
Bands on me, young nigga, big dog, take that
