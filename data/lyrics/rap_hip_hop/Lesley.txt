Father forgive me, for you know that I'm always sinning
I take no interest partying with liquor, fucking up my system
Father forgive me, for you know that I'm always sinning
I take no interest partying with liquor, fucking up my system

Now it's been 2 years since I hurt you
I remember Instagram, used to search you up
When I didn't give a fuck, I was still on all your pics
Now I made a couple bucks
And I think I made a difference, you miss me like all of a sudden
I used to love you but now I'm just runnin'
From thoughts in my head cause I think that you bluffin'
You only want me cause I'm gettin' money
I only want you cause back in the day, you had played with my feelings, put knots in my stomach
I only think you that dated me just cause you hated me, you always treated me funny
You said you love me too fast, I knew it
I fell in love with the past and blew it
Realized I need the cash, I knew it
I never thought you would last, so threw it

Father forgive me, For I know I’m sinnin’
I'm off of this Henny, the room keep on spinnin’
I tryna impress her, so I keep on spendin’
She makin’ me jealous so I think she winnin’
Fallin’ awake, god, I’m hatin’ this feelin’
You are my drug, make my eyes hit the ceilin’
It’s finna take a long time for this healin’
She broke my heart and my soul she was stealin’
It’s been so long since somebody cared
‘Bout somethin’ that's other than money instead
You care ‘bout your followers, baby, I’m here
I'd follow you, honestly everywhere
But you want to play with me head
The only time you feelin’ me is in bed
I swear that you treated me worse than the dead
You act like I didn’t exist, but I did
But you still get mad, everytime I left you on read
Baby, I told you I was gon’ get bread
And now that I’m here, you wan’ be friends
Honestly, I should be apologizin’
I was a dog when I think about it
There’s always two sides to the shit, regardless
So when I look back, I’m the one that’s heartless
Shit, we should start speakin’ again
I know that you listenin’ in
Nah chill, I can’t see you again
Cause I do not want to be friends
Matter fact I don’t know what I want
Gotta make up my way to the top
And my heart will be broke till it stop
And my heart will be broke till it stop

Father forgive me, for you know that I'm always sinning
I take no interest partying with liquor, fucking up my system
Father forgive me, for you know that I'm always sinning
I take no interest partying with liquor, fucking up my system
Father forgive me, for you know that I'm always sinning
I take no interest partying with liquor, fucking up my system
