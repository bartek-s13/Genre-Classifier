I love bad bitches, that's my fucking problem
And yea I like to fuck, I gotta fucking problem
If finding somebody really is your problem
Bring your girls to the crib, maybe we could solve it

Marry to the game, I just ain't have a wedding
I hear alot of things, but you won't see me telling
They swear I go bananas, till I give them watermelon
I see you sneezing girl, well let me come and give you blessings woah
You already know, you already know
We get high, we get super high, never going low
With the squad and we going hard when we on the road
Ima live till I have the greatest story ever told yea
I swear I love being immature
I do what I fucking want, now would you like a signature
Life is not a bitch, its just simply how you deal with her
Money getting longer, you could check out the perimeter
But I do not care about money or fame
I just do me and I stay in my lane
Everybody wanna be the controller
Until they find out that they only the game
Funny how people who swear that they love me and care for me Always got something to say
But I do not care when they say I got problems ima do me at the end of the day

I love bad bitches, that's my fucking problem
And yea I like to fuck, I gotta fucking problem
If finding somebody really is your problem
Bring your girls to the crib, maybe we could solve it

Expect the unexpected, even when your ready
So many cameras moving, I tell them keep it steady
I run around these hoes but see I'll never let them sweat me
I'm on my sonic shit, I tell them they could come in get me, yea
Yea I'm gone, yea I'm gone, yea I'm gone
I be tryna do some right but I'm always doing wrong
And my ex she be trippen why can't we just get along
So much snakes in my grass could somebody cut the lawn yea
That's why I'm switching up my atmosphere
If you ain't with the good vibes then we go kick you outta here
People dap me up cause the finally see the vision clear
But if I lose it all i know there leave and they would disappear
That why I do not care about money or fame
I just do me and I stay in my lane
Everybody wanna be the controller
Until they find out that they only the game
Funny how people who swear that they love and care for me always Got something to say
But I do not care when they say I got problems ima do me at the end of the day sing

I love bad bitches, that's my fucking problem
And yea I like to fuck, I gotta fucking problem
If finding somebody really is your problem
Bring your girls to the crib, maybe we could solve it
