I ain't gonna take it no more
I ain't gonna take it no more
I ain't gonna stand idly by while the bridal reply
Of a marriage of styles is "yeah, but what's their demographic?"
I ain't gonna take it no more
I ain't gonna take it no more
I ain't gonna stand idly by with a tut and a sigh
While inside we all cry out for something new
I ain't gonna take it no more
I ain't gonna take it no more
Soulless music, artless lyrics
Goalless movements, heartless gimmicks
Controlled and clueless, careers lasting a minute
If this is the big life, well I ain't looking to live it
We ain't pushing boundaries, we're blowing them up
We ain't trying to expand the scene, we want the scene to erupt
So make some room on the floor and somebody bolt the doors
Cause tonight we ain't seeking applause
Tonight, well, gee...
We just wanna have some good new fashioned fun now, y'all!
The beat that my heart skipped sounded like this
Every now and then I cower and I need to find empowerment
Empowerment is paramount to how I can begin to mount
A plan that I can implement to make a dent on ignorance
Instead of drunk belligerence and the dissidence of miscreants
Especially in this instance with the never ending persistence
To use the words in each sentence as if they were blunt instruments
To beat a hole in the defence of this beauty and her innocence
Which serves to just build resistance in spite of all my good intents

The beat that my heart skipped
This is the beat that my heart skipped
This is the beat that my heart skipped

This is the beat that my heart skipped when we first met
Now that I've heard it, it leaves me with a kind of regret
No disrespect, but we left a lot of people upset
And what we had wasn't really what we'd come to expect
The beat that my heart skipped when we first met
Now that I've heard it, it leaves me with a kind of regret
No disrespect, but we left a lot of people upset
And what we had wasn't really what we'd come to expect
Well good God damn and other such phrases
I haven't heard a beat like this in ages
To miss such a beat would have been outrageous
But when your heart skips a beat, it's ruthless and aimless

She caught my attention in her fishnets
Then she reeled me in, expecting nothing more than kissed necks and quick sex
But that weren't the case with this platinum princess
She'd attracted my interest and I wanted to impress
Upon her all the positive things
That come from having more than just a one night fling
But that's something easier in theory than in practice
Since pick up lines are tactics to get prey to the mattress
And this actress is practiced in shunning such theatrics
When put upon daily by tactless geriatrics
So my genuine advances are met with po-faced scepticism
Throwing compliments but she just straight elects to miss them
Her lips were put on this earth for dispersing wisdom
God forbid I suggest she lets me kiss them
But I really want to know what she thinks of me
Because I'm loving every idiosyncrasy
But I ain't one to jump through hoops to make a first impression
Been there, done that, learnt the worst of lessons
We want to be loved for who we appear to be instead of who we are
So our real selves take a backseat behind the pomp and the façade
And that's as true of the rude boys, downing pints and acting hard
As of the kids shunning convention with clinical disregard
This is the beat that my heart skipped
And it went..
This is the beat that my heart skipped when we first met
Now that I've heard it, it leaves me with a kind of regret
