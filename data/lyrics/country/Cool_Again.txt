Been workin' all week
Finally got the night off
Spent the cash that we don't have
And we both drank a little too much
We were feelin' that tequila by the time that we got home
I said somethin' dumb, you said somethin' smart
Oh hell yeah, it was on

You slammed the door, I slammed a beer
You called your friends, I dissapeared
That's it I quit, my bags are packed
But one little kiss and I'm back

We're in, we're out
We're here and then we're gone
Sometimes we fight but to get it right
We gotta do it all wrong
We're in, we're out, we're out, we're in
We're high and then we're not
Then we're cool again

Next mornin' wake up
Too hungover to be mad
Can't remember now what it was all about
All we can do is laugh
I push your buttons, you pull my chain
I go crazy, you go insane
We break up, make up all night long
We turn it off just to turn it back on

We're in, we're out
We're here and then we're gone
Sometimes we fight but to get it right
We gotta do it all wrong
We're in, we're out, we're out, we're in
We're high and then we're not
Then we're cool again
We're in, we're out
We're here and then we're gone
Sometimes we fight but to get it right
We gotta do it all wrong
We're in, we're out, we're out, we're in
We're high and then we're not
Then we're cool again
We're in, we're out, we're out, we're in
We're high and then we're not
Then we're cool again
Then we're cool again
Yeah, baby we're cool again
