I go out walking after midnight
Out in the moonlight just like we used to do
I'm always walking after midnight, searching for you
I walk for miles along the highway
Well, that's just my way of saying, I love you
I'm always walking after midnight, searching for you

I stopped to see a weeping willow
Crying on his pillow
Maybe he's crying for me
And as the skies turn gloomy
Night winds whisper to me
I'm lonesome as I can be

I go out walking after midnight
Out in the starlight
Just hoping you may be somewhere walking
After midnight searching for me

I stopped to see a weeping willow
Crying on his pillow
Maybe he's crying for me
And as the skies turn gloomy
Night winds whisper to me
I'm lonesome as I can be

I'm out walking after midnight, out in the starlight
Just hoping maybe you're somewhere
Walking after midnight, searching for me
