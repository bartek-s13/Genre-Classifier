I know a place
Down a little bitty back road
Tucked way back
Lit by the moon-glow
Homegrown wine in a tree ol' stash
Kudzu cabin could you dig on that
Girl don't you worry about the rumor mill running
I got the wheel, you can be shotgunning
They can print about us in the morning news
Two lovers missing after a late night cruise
Don't say a word, just hop right in
Take your little white VW for a spin
Turn some heads, cause a commotion
Everybody howlin' out "Where they going?"
Lets get this whole town talking about us
And live out the story they're gonna make up
If you're looking for a little take your breathe away
I know, I know, I know
A place
I can serrate ya on the front porch swing
We can sit back and let the crickets sing
Ya, there won't be anybody else for 80 miles around
We can do our skinny-dipping before the sun goes down
Don't say a word, just hop right in
Take your little white VW for a spin
Turn some heads, cause a commotion
Everybody howlin' out "Where they going?"
Lets get this whole town talking about us
And live out the story they're gonna make up
If you're looking for a little take your breathe away
I know, I know, I know
A place
Way back in the hills
Girl we can't go wrong
Just a little you and me
And a whole lot of gone
They just disappear
A couple runaways
Let em' say what they gonna say
I know, I know, I know
A place
Don't say a word, just hop right in
Take your little white VW for a spin
Turn some heads, cause a commotion
Everybody howlin' out "Where they going?"
Lets get this whole town talking about us
And live out the story they're gonna make up
If you're looking for a little take your breathe away
Ya later on you really wanna hide away
I know, I know, I know
A place
I know a place
Way back in the hills
Girl we can't go wrong
I know a place
