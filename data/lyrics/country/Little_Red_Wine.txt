You've been working that dead-end job
From nine until five
Struggling from week to week
To get the bills paid on time
Sometimes, it's a little too hard
Just to drink it off at night
The beer just won't cut it
And liquor's a little much
You need something just right

How about a little red wine
And moonshine and you and me
Killing time and daylight
And can't you see how it's turning
This one night into everything
That you've ever dreamed of
And shining our headlights
Into the pond and waiting on
The sunshine as we unwind
And sing along every word
Of every line of your favorite song
While we're sipping on
A little red wine
A little red wine
Bossman went a little too far
Now you're going insane
Think you might have to burn it all down
At the sound of his name
Think that I can help you out
See what I can do
'Cause I've got a dirt road
Radio playing, and a bottle for two

Of a little red wine
And moonshine and you and me
Killing time and daylight
And can't you see how it's turning
This one night into everything
That you've ever dreamed of
And shining our headlights
Into the pond and waiting on
The sunshine as we unwind
And sing along every word
Of every line of your favorite song
While we're sipping on
A little red wine
A little red wine
I can tell by the sound of your voice
Saying, "Baby, I'm home"
Just the tone and the slamming of the door
That you need to be alone

With a little red wine
And moonshine and you and me
Killing time and daylight
And can't you see how it's turning
This one night into everything
That you've ever dreamed of
And shining our headlights
Into the pond and waiting on
The sunshine as we unwind
And sing along every word
Of every line of your favorite song
While we're sipping on
A little red wine
A little red wine
