Must've been living under a rock
Must've not left the house for a couple of years
All the telephones, TVs, radios off
Put a blindfold on, cotton in my ears
Cause you got this instantly recognizable quality about you babe
Yeah I gotta say

Girl you look famous
Like South Beach or Vegas
All up in the paper, in the supermarket aisle
That dress on you I swear
I know you from somewhere
Gotta know what your name is
Cause God you look famous when you smile
Ooh when you smile

Some show, some song, billboard or commercial
Do you do the weather, do you read the news?
Girl you got my head spinning around in circles
And by the way I'm looking at you
And everybody else is too I'm thinking

Girl you look famous
Like South Beach or Vegas
All up in the paper, in the supermarket aisle
That dress on you I swear
I know you from somewhere
Gotta know what your name is
Cause God you look famous when you smile
Famous when you smile

You got your elbows on the bar
Shinin' in the blue neon
Yeah something I just can't place or put my finger on
Cause you got this instantly recognizable quality about you babe
Yeah you might not be but

Ooh girl you look famous
Like South Beach or Vegas
All up in the paper, in the supermarket aisle
That dress you got on got me looking for some paparazzi
Gotta know what your name is
Girl you look famous when you smile
Famous when you smile
Girl you look famous
You look so famous when you smile
