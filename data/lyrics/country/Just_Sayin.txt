Hey girl, looks like you need one more
Yeah I bet you've heard that one before
Small talk cliché is what all the other guys say
I don't wanna get ahead of myself, are you in or out baby I can't tell
Did I see those blue eyes giving me the green light?

Tell me, tell me girl am I reading this right?
I know, I know it sounds like a pick up line
Standing over here all by ourselves, and you ain't looking at one else

I ain't sayin' we should leave right now
But girl from the second you walked in your eyes have been doing all the talking
I ain't sayin' we should ditch this crowd, but baby that moonlight's fading
You're here, I'm here, yeah yeah I'm just sayin'
Oh whoah, I'm just sayin' I'm just sayin'

You can leave me hanging in suspense, or we can spend all night sitting on the fence
We'll leave your friends with my friends, You know what I'm getting at
Girl I hate to state the obvious but something's going down between the two of us
The sparks keep flying and we ain't even tryin'

Tell me tell me girl am I reading this right?
I know, I know it sounds like a pick up line, how's it gonna end?
Baby I don't know but here we are dancing slow

I ain't sayin' we should leave right now
But girl from the second you walked in your eyes have been doing all the talking
I ain't sayin' we should ditch this crowd, but baby that moonlight's fading
You're here, I'm here, yeah yeah I'm just sayin'
Oh whoah, I'm just sayin' I'm just sayin'

Tell me, tell me girl am I reading this right?
I know, I know it sounds like a pick up line
Standing over here all by ourselves, and you ain't looking at one else
Tell me tell me girl am I reading this right?
I know, I know it sounds like a pick up line, how's it gonna end?
Baby I don't know but here we are dancing slow
I'm just sayin'

I ain't sayin' we should leave right now
But girl from the second you walked in your eyes have been doing all the talking
I ain't sayin' we should ditch this crowd, but baby that moonlight's fading
You're here, I'm here, yeah, I'm just sayin'
Oh whoah, I'm just sayin'
You're here, I'm here, yeah, I'm just sayin'
Oh whoah, yeah girl I'm just sayin'
You're here, I'm here, yeah yeah I'm just sayin'
