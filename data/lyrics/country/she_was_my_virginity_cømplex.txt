3am throw the drinks down
When I really need rest
Fucked up but I'm okay ay
Never seen her undressed yuh
No remorse when I rotate
Rotate, rotate never ok
Girl body like a solvent ay
For the pain for the, pain yuh

Baby fuck me 'cause I'm all alone
Girl I tried you on your fucking phone
One more time before I go to bed
Oh just fuck me fore I go to bed
Girl I miss you and your fucking head
Now I'm wrapped up in my fuckin' head
Girl you asked if I make love to you
Oh I do I do I do I do

Try try try to function
See me swaying back and forth
Reaching for your soft skin
Just to find another girl's breast in my grip
In the dark and my other hand pressed against her heart beatin' ey
You know I miss you when I'm sittin' down here
With this girl slumped all up in my chest
Tears streaming down her cheeks
Fearin' that I didn't love her leaving creases on her heart
Darker than the stains pressed deep into my sheets, damn
Then she started poppin' pills
And i was in my feels so I let her
Scribbled fake love notes all up in those letters
Signed with my initials and a “hope you feel better”
Lookin like a cigarette burnin' through her lungs
Tongue kissin' on her mouth south travel down her stomach
I'm in love I'm in love I'm in love it's what I told her
Chin deep in pussy guilt heavy on my shoulders ey damn

Coughin', she coughin'
That pussy poppin'
Girl you keep on talkin'
Oh just let me hop in
Always fuckin' off it
Put me in a coffin
Baby girl don't stop it now
Keep that pussy poppin'
Often often
Girl this shit is toxic
But I love the way she move
I love the way she move
Way she move
Way she move
Way she move
Fuck what you put me through
