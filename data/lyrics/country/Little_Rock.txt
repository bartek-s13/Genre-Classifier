Well, I know I disappeared a time or two
And along the way I lost me and you
I needed a new town for my new start
Selling VCR's in Arkansas at a Wal-Mart
I haven't had a drink in nineteen days
My eyes are clear and bright without that haze
I like the preacher from the Church of Christ
Sorry that I cried when I talked to you last night
I think I'm on a roll here in Little Rock
I'm solid as a stone, baby, wait and see
I've got just one small problem here in Little Rock
Without you, baby I'm not me
I don't know why I held it all inside
You must've thought I never even tried
You know your daddy told me when I left
That Jesus would forgive, but a daddy don't forget
I think I'm on a roll here in Little Rock
I'm solid as a stone, baby, wait and see
I've got just one small problem here in Little Rock
Without you, baby I'm not me
Lying here upon this motel bed
My thoughts of you explode inside my head
Like a castle built upon the sand
I let love crumble in my hand
I think I'm on a roll here in Little Rock
I'm solid as a stone, baby, wait and see
I've got just one small problem here in Little Rock
Without you, baby I'm not me
Without you, baby I'm not me...
I think I'm on a roll here in Little Rock
