Are you out tonight?
Somewhere loud tonight?
Listening to a bar band
Play sad songs that you can’t stand?
Are you taking shots?
And trying to chase away those thoughts
Doing what lonely people do?
Well, I am too

I am too many drinks in not to want to call you up
I got too many memories, but not enough
Are you sitting somewhere tonight
Trying not to think about us?
I am too far to walk, too drunk to dare to drive
Am I way too gone for another try?
Are you blaming me for everything I did and I didn’t do?
I am too, ooh
I am too

Are you hiding out
In a brand-new crowd?
Does it make you think of us
Like everything else does?

I am too many drinks in not to want to call you up
I got too many memories, but not enough
Are you sitting somewhere tonight
Trying not to think about us?
I am too far to walk, too drunk to dare to drive
Am I way too gone for another try?
Are you blaming me for everything I did and I didn’t do?
I am too, ooh
I am too

Are you saying that you’re moving on, but you ain’t hardly moved?
Are you wondering how you’re ever gonna love somebody new?

I am too many drinks in not to want to call you up
I got too many memories, but not enough
Are you sitting somewhere tonight
Trying not to think about us?
I am too far to walk, too drunk to dare to drive
Am I way too gone for another try?
Are you blaming me for everything we did and we didn’t do?
I am too, yeah
(I am too many drinks in not to want to call you up)
I am too
(I got too many memories, but not enough)
I am too
(Too far to walk, too drunk to dare to drive)
I am too
