He had a Southern drawl like a red-bone hound
Every song he sang was my favorite sound
He'd be the last one off if the ship went down
Kinda man it feels good to be around
Kinda man it feels good to be around
Had hair as white as a cotton field
And he could spin you a story like a wagon wheel
Never went nowhere without a rod and reel
Lord I miss that man and I always will
I miss that man and I always will
He'd see through a lie like an old screen door
He taught me how to hunt and how to love the Lord
He carried a bible and a .44
And they just don't make 'em like that no more
Said, "take what you've got and do the best you can
Best thing you'll ever own is a piece of land"
Y'all he knew his like the back of his hand
He was something else, my old man
He was something else, my old man
He'd see through a lie like an old screen door
He taught me how to hunt and how to love the Lord
He carried a bible and a .44
And they just don't make 'em like that no more
Saw him strum this thing every chance he could
And he left it to me like he said he would
If you ask me why it sounds so good
It's 'cause I'm holdin' more than strings and wood
I'm holdin' more than strings and wood
He'd see through a lie like an old screen door
He taught me how to hunt and how to love the Lord
He carried a bible and a .44
And they just don't make 'em like that no more
No they just don't make 'em like that no more
