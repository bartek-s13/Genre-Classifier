An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red eyed cows he saw
A-plowin' through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw
Yippee-yi-ya, yippee-yi-yo
Ghost herd in the sky
Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear shot through him as he looked up in the sky
For he saw the riders comin' hard and he heard their mournful cry
Yippee-yi-ya, yippee-yi-yo
Ghost riders in the sky
Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
They're riding hard to catch that herd, but they ain't caught 'em yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
On horses snortin' fire, as they ride on hear their cry
Yippee-yi-ya, yippee-yi-yo
Ghost riders in the sky
The cowpokes loped on past him and he heard one call his name
If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range
Then cowboy, change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-trying to catch the devil's herd across these endless skies
Yippee-yi-ya, yippee-yi-yo
Ghost riders in the sky
