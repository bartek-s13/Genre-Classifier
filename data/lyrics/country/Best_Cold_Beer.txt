Last night, slow night, slow crowd
So I thought well one more
No more then I'll head on home by myself
That band kicked in, oh man
I saw you dancing, Friday night dress and a Sunday smile
No way I was leaving then

That was the best cold beer I never drank
Best damn half buzz double take
When you pulled me out on the dance floor
That song ended, rolled into one more
That was the best five bucks I ever blew
When last call caught me kissing you
I tipped the bartender while he poured it down the sink
That was the best cold beer I never drank
Never drank, never drank
The best cold beer I never drank
Never drank, never drank

Long gone, neon, slow song
You pull me close
My hands, your hips
Your lips were like an invitation
To a party, girl I'm sorry if it seems like I've been chuggin' Bacardi
Just blue eyed drunk, a little red lip stoned
You're the only high I was on
That was the best cold beer I never drank
Best damn half buzz double take
When you pulled me out on the dance floor
That song ended, rolled into one more
That was the best five bucks I ever blew
When last call caught me kissing you
I tipped the bartender while he poured it down the sink
That was the best cold beer I never drank
Never drank, never drank
The best cold beer I never drank
Never drank, never drank


That long neck I wasted I didn't even taste it
But every time I'd trade it for one more goodnight kiss
That was the best cold beer I never drank
Best damn half buzz double take
When you pulled me out on the dance floor
That song ended, rolled into one more

The best five bucks I ever blew
When last call caught me kissing you
I tipped the bartender while he poured it down the sink
That was the best cold beer I never drank
Never drank, never drank
The best cold beer I never drank
Never drank, never drank
The best cold beer I never drank
Never drank, never drank
