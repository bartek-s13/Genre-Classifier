I don't need another sip of bourbon
Another drop of ninety proof
To get me feelin' like I'm feelin' baby all I need is you
Giving me that come on stare
Gets me there
All it's gonna take is your weight
Pulling on the neck of my shirt
Doing that walk that might as well talk
I love just to watch ya flirt your way on up those stairs
It gets me there
It's gonna be you kissing on me
Wrapping me up
Running you fingers through my hair, yeah
It's gonna be you getting so close
That our shadows are dancing like smoke
Up in the air, yeah
We don't have to go nowhere
For you to get me there
Ain't no place we can't get to
Barefoot in this backroad ice
I taste California on your lips from the wine we just poured out
Pretty girl I swear
It gets me there
It's gonna be you kissing on me
Wrapping me up
Running you fingers through my hair, yeah
It's gonna be you getting so close
That our shadows are dancing like smoke
Up in the air, yeah
We don't have to go nowhere
For you to get me there
We can be, we can be anywhere
Couple lights burn like on our face
Don't know what it is but girl I swear
It gets me there
It's gonna be you kissing on me
Wrapping me up
Running you fingers through my hair, yeah
It's gonna be you getting so close
That our shadows are dancing like smoke
Up in the air, yeah
We don't have to go nowhere
For you to get me there
We can be, we can be anywhere
Couple lights burn like on our face
Don't know what it is but girl I swear
