Me and my fam go ham, go hard in the paint
We laugh we party we drink
Thats my kin, my friends, i’ll love em till the end ‘cause life passes by in a blink (Yeah)

Front porch chillin, back yard grilling
Loaded blunt smokin, round and round rollin
Listening to the radio with nowhere to go wishin’ we would never grow old

Time flies when you’re having fun
Growing up, but we’re still young
Our blood runs thicker than mud
Let em ride the wave, just cause
We turn up until the sun goes down
We’ve grown up but we still run this town
Never die, feel forever young
‘Cause my fam knows I got love
And it runs in our blood (blood)
Runs in our blood (blood)
Runs in our blood (blood)
Runs in our blood (blood)

Yesterday we was kids playin ball, got punched in the jaw then we beat em down till they called the law
Yesterday we was teens chasing girls in them jeans, what a team bad as hell we was really goin off
(Yeah)

Nothin like family, part of your anatomy
Hold you down like gravity and got your back happily
Roots runnin through our soul, family tree it grows, sitting back man we really gettin old

Time flies when you’re having fun
Growing up, but we’re still young
Our blood runs thicker than mud
Let em ride the wave, just cause
We turn up until the sun goes down
We’ve grown up but we still run this town
Never die, feel forever young
‘Cause my fam knows I got love
And it runs in our blood (blood)
Runs in our blood (blood)
Runs in our blood (blood)
It runs in our blood (It runs in our blood)

Gettin’ through the fuss in and fighting ‘cause when it stops
Can’t let go of family ‘cause family’s all we got
Them days I ain’t have money, I knew that I had enough
I know who got my back when things get rough

Time flies when you’re having fun
Growing up, but we’re still young
Our blood runs thicker than mud
Let em ride the wave, just cause
We turn up until the sun goes down
We’ve grown up but we still run this town
Never die, feel forever young (so young)
‘Cause my fam knows I got love
And it runs in our blood (blood)
Runs in our blood (It runs in our blood)
Runs in our blood (blood)
It runs in our blood (It runs In our blood)
