There's a girl down in Texas
Holds hope in her eyes
Smile so soft and warming it stays with you for miles
She's a lifetime of happy years, she's a million memories
There's a girl down in Texas and she's waitin' on me

So give her the River Walk instead of Broadway
And Sixth Street over L.A
And a salted margarita over a martini
Give me her in a poncho by a fire at night on the Frio
Safe in my arms is right where she wants to be
There's a girl down in Texas waitin' on me

Oh she's a Sunday morning stroll
At the park by the lake
The answer to my prayers when I started to lose faith
When I'm on the lonely road in the chasing my dreams
There's a girl down in Texas and she's waitin' on me

So give her the River Walk instead of Broadway
And Sixth Street over L.A
And a salted margarita over a martini
Give me her in a poncho by a fire at night on the Frio
Safe in my arms is right where she wants to be
There's a girl down in Texas waitin' on me

Takes an angel of a woman to do everything she needs
To be herself and not relent and still find time for me

So give her the River Walk instead of Broadway
And Sixth Street over L.A
And a salted margarita over a martini
Give me her in a poncho by a fire at night on the Frio
Safe in my arms is right where she wants to be
There's a girl down in Texas waitin' on me

Oh there's a girl down in Texas
And lovin' me
