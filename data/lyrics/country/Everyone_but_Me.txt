We plow a similar field
Of all the bones of remembered hearts
And all the crackpot dreams
And all the backroom art

We run a similar course
On a track laid with broken glass
So tie your shoes real tight
It goes by real fast

Mother and Father
Now that you're gone
It's not nearly long enough
Still it seems too long

I gave up my name for you
Gave up my edge, it made me bleed
And I pleased everyone
I mean everyone but me

There behind the closing door
I'm not enough and then too much
Our strange and beautiful lives
Fade and turn to dust

Mother and Father
Now that you're gone
It's not nearly long enough
Still it seems too long
It just wasn't long enough
Still it seems too long
