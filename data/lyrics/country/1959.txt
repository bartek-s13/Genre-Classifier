Cigarettes were a quarter then
Bobby-socks and jeans were in
Elvis sang the songs that we loved so
But the most important thing to us
Was keepin' gas in my old truck
So I could take us to the drive-in show
I never will forget the day
That you and I went all the way
I was the first for you - and you for me
I've still got the truck that we loved in
It takes me back there now and then
Back to '59 my memory
And
Baby I'm yours
I'll love you always
I'm gonna stand by you until the end of time
Remember all of the good things
That we shared together
Signed - love Betty - 1959
Graduation finally came
Uncle Sam called me away
You married someone else while I was gone
I kept your letters all these years
And I can't help but shed a tear
When I read the words you wrote me years ago
Baby I'm yours
I'll love you always
I'm gonna stand by you until the end of time
Remember all of the good things
That we shared together
Signed - love Betty - 1959
