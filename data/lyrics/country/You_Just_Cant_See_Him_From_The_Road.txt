Well, you don't see him much on the big screen anymore
The kids don't ride along with Roy or Gene
And that ain't really him with all those feathers in his hat
And some Frenchman's name embroidered on his jeans

But he's still out there ridin' fences
Still makes his livin' with his rope
As long as there's a sunset, he'll keep ridin' for the brand
You just can't see him from the road

Well, he never learned to two step - hell, he barely learned to walk
But he's worn a lot of leather off the tree
He's had one or two good horses that he counts among his friends
He never drew a breath that wasn't free

But he's still out there ridin' fences
Still makes his livin' with his rope
As long as there's a sunset, he'll keep ridin' for the brand
You just can't see him from the road

Well, he's tall in the saddle and short on the cash
The last to quit, the first to buy the beer
Well, he's a knight in leather armor still livin' by the code
That's made him what he's been a hundred years
But he's still out there ridin' fences
Still makes his livin' with his rope
As long as there's a sunset, he'll keep ridin' for the brand
You just can't see him from the road

As long as there's a sunset, he'll keep ridin' for the brand
You just can't see him from the road
