She said she always wanted to see the ocean
Guess she never had a reason to go
Leave it up to me to finally give her one
Oh but what it was, what it was, I still don't know

It's over my head, over my head
727 Whisperjet with the pedal down westbound
Over my head, over my head
Putting it together here on the ground
Didn't see it coming 'til she took off
Since she went to running, she's been running all
Over my head, over my head
Over my head

I wonder if she's up there thinking 'bout me
Wishing she could turn that thing around
By the time she hits that Cali runway, I'll be done for
'Cause everything she needs is out there
But everything I need right now

It's over my head, over my head
727 Whisperjet with the pedal down westbound
Over my head, over my head
Putting it together here on the ground
Didn't see it coming 'til she took off
Since she went to running, she's been running all
Over my head, over my head
Over my head


I guess what it is, is what it was
Yeah, 'cause all that's left is me, just looking up

Over my head, over my head
727 Whisperjet with the pedal down westbound
Over my head, over my head
Putting it together here on the ground
Didn't see it coming 'til she took off
Since she went to running, she's been running all
Over my head, over my head
Over my head

Over my head, over my head
Over my head
