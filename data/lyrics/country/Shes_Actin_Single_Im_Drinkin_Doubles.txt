I've seen men look at her before
And they think I don't see
I'd like to think it makes me proud
But I'm only fooling me
I know she'll be looking back
The minute I'm not there
While she pours herself on some stranger
I pour myself a drink somewhere
She's acting single, I'm drinking doubles
I hide my pain, I drown my troubles
My heart is breaking like the tiny bubbles
She's acting single, I'm drinking doubles
I know what she plans to do
But I don't know where or when
If I ask who that stranger was
She'll just say an old friend
I'm not weak, I tell myself
I stay because I'm strong
The truth is, I'm not man enough
To stop her from doing me wrong
She's acting single, I'm drinking doubles
I hide my pain, I drown my troubles
My heart is breaking like the tiny bubbles
She's acting single, I'm drinking doubles
She's acting single, I'm drinking doubles
I hide my pain
