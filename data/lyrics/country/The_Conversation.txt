Hank let's talk about your daddy tell me how your mama loved that man
Well just break out a bottle hoss I'll tell you about the driftin' cowboy band
We won't talk about the habits just the music and the manthat's all
Now Hank if you just got to tell me did your daddy really write all them songs, did he?
That don't deserve no answer hoss let's light up and just move along
Do you think he wrote 'em about your mama or about the man who done her wrong?
You know that

Well back then they called him crazy now a days they call him a saint
Now the ones that called him crazy are still ridin' on his name

Well if he was here right now Bocephus
Would he think that we were right do you think he might?
Don't you know he would Watasha be right by our side
If we left for a show in Provo he'd be the first one on the bus and ready to ride
I just wanna go hoss
Wherever he is I hope he's happy and I hope he's doin' well, yes I do
He is 'cause he's got one arm around my mama now
How he sure did love Miss Audrey and raisin' hell
I won't ask you no more questions to the stories only Hank could tell

Well back then they called him crazy now a days they call him a saint
Most folks don't know that they fired him from the Opry
And that caused him the greatest pain
I loved to tell you about lovesick and how Miss Audrey loved that man
You know I've always loved to listen
To the stories about that driftin' cowboy band, yes man
You know when we get right down to it still the most wanted outlaws in the land
Yeah, woo
