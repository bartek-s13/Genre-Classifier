I got a ring from home
I was miles away
I could tell by her tone
It just wasn't my day
She said she was leaving
All cold as hell
She was giving me reasons
And I was telling myself

To keep her on the line
Say any damn thing at all
To keep her on the line
Keep looking for a way to stall
'Cause if you let her go, she's really gone this time
So keep her on the line

We've been here before
We know what works
So this ain't fair
She knows I ain't good with the words
If I could just get there
'Fore she leaves the drive
I'll hold her close
And she'll change her mind

Just gotta keep her on the line
Say any damn thing at all
To keep her on the line
Keep looking for a way to stall
'Cause if you let her go, she's really gone this time
So keep her on the line

Yeah keep her on the line
Say any damn thing at all
To keep her on the line
Keep looking for a way to stall
'Cause if you let her go, she's really gone this time
So keep her on the line

I got a ring from home
I was miles away
I could tell by her tone
It just wasn't my day
