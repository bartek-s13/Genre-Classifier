We've been lying to ourselves
Acting like we're something else
How'd we get in this masquerade?
There's a secret in your eyes
It's the same one that's in mine
Aren't you tired of being this way?
Call it what you want, call it what you want
Call it what you want, but it won't change a thing
Call it what you want, call it what you want
Call it what you want, but at the end of the day

We're a kiss at 2 AM that tastes like wine
We're a ride home in the dark with our fingers intertwined
You and me keep on tryna pretend
But you and me, yeah, we gotta admit
We're an extra set of clothes on the bedroom floor
Where I see you all the time, but still wanna see you more
You and me keep on tryna pretend
But you and me, mmm, we're not friends
No, we're not friends, mmm (No)

Friends are something that we were
Before me sleeping in your shirt
But, baby, we're past that now
Friends don't do the things we do
Friends don't use the words we use, yeah
Friends could just hang out
But we're a kiss at 2 AM that tastes like wine
We're a ride home in the dark with our fingers intertwined
You and me keep on tryna pretend
But you and me, yeah, we gotta admit
We're an extra set of clothes on the bedroom floor
Where I see you all the time, but still wanna see you more
You and me keep on tryna pretend
But you and me, woah, we're not friends
We're not friends, no

We're a kiss at 2 AM that tastes like wine
A ride home in the dark with our fingers intertwined
You and me keep on tryna pretend
But you and me, yeah, we got to admit
We're an extra set of clothes on the bedroom floor
Where I see you all the time, but still wanna see you more
You and me keep on tryna pretend
But you and me, woah, we're not friends
No, we're not friends
