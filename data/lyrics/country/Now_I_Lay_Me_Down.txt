(Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep)
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray tonight that I won't weep
For the girl who went away
And left me here to hurt this way
If I die before I wake
At least my heart won't ache
Now I lay me down to sleep
Bless the girl that I still love
May she find true happiness
And make me strong enough
To overcome this loneliness
The sandman's waiting patiently
But there's too many memories
I know tonight that I won't sleep
So I lay me down to weep
Now I lay me down to weep
