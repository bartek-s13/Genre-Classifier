There's plenty 'bout me that I don't like
Most mistakes I've made, I made them twice
Sometimes I don't live out the words I say
And I just can't stay out my own way
But my good intentions overflow
Way down deep inside my bones
Though my head's been known to give me hell
This heart of mine is just something else, yeah

But the best part of me, part of me is you
Is you, is you
Yeah, the best part of me, part of me is you
Is you

I got my old man's baby blues
And his daddy's taste for whiskey too
My brother's love for rock 'n' roll
And my momma's southern gospel soul

But the best part of me, part of me
Is you, is you
Yeah, the best part of me, part of me
Is you

Something takes over me
Every moment you hold my hand
Hearts beat in time
As the start all align and I understand

That the best part of me, the best part of me, oh
Yeah the best part of me, part of me
Is you, oh
The best part of me, part of me
Is you
Oh, is you, ooh
