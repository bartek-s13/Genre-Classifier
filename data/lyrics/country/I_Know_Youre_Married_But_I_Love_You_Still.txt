I know you're married, but I love you still

The day I met you, my heart spoke to me
It said to love you through eternity
Not knowing that you were another's pride
I vowed I'd always be close by your side

I love you darlin' and I always will
I know you're married but I love you still

You broke a heart, dear, that would die for you
I'd give the world if I could be with you
The game is over, now I know I've lost
My broken heart will have to pay the cost

I love you darlin' and I always will
I know you're married but I love you still

You know I love you and I always will
I know you're married but I love you still
You know I love you and I always will
I know you're married but I love you still
