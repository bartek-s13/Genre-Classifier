See the sun coming up from the front seat of a Greyhound bus
Felt the rain on the faces I was standing at the gates of Graceland
Searching for something, searching for someone
Lost on the highway a little dazed and confused
But the haze of the road dust comes into focus
Every time I look at you

You're a little white church on a corner in Mississippi
The front porch light that feels like home, girl
Look at you shine, lovin' you is like findin'
A diamond in a rhinestone world
You're a red Corvette on a Carolina two lane
Lighter in the air to a damn good song, girl
Can't believe you're mine lovin' you is like findin'
A diamond in a rhinestone world
Oh-oh, you're a diamond in a rhinestone world

Waking up all alone
Means you might have just been chasing ghosts
And all the glitter fades fast
And a gold rush ain't made to last

You're a little white church on a corner in Mississippi
The front porch light that feels like home, girl
Look at you shine, lovin' you is like findin'
A diamond in a rhinestone world
You're a red Corvette on a Carolina two lane
Lighter in the air to a damn good song, girl
Can't believe you're mine lovin' you is like findin'
A diamond in a rhinestone world
Oh-oh, you're a diamond in a rhinestone world
You're a little white church on a corner in Mississippi
The front porch light that feels like home, girl
Look at you shine, lovin' you is like findin'
A diamond in a rhinestone world
You're a red Corvette on a Carolina two lane
Lighter in the air to a damn good song, girl
Can't believe you're mine lovin' you is like findin'
A diamond in a rhinestone world
Oh-oh, you're a diamond in a rhinestone world
You're a diamond in a rhinestone world
