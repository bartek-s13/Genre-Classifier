We've been waiting all week
Been waiting on the weekend
To crawl out of the shadows
With the ones your mama said run from
The ones your daddy kept you from
Now we're all on the loose
And we are here
Everybody raise your glass
(Hey, hey, hey)
Pick it up and throw it back
Grab ahold of your honey
And everybody get a little lovin'
A little touchin'
A little kissin' and a huggin'
Do a little lovin'
Touchin'
A little kissin' and a huggin'
Cause we don't need no sleep tonight
Everybody's bumpin' to the beat just right
We'll worry 'bout tomorrow when tomorrow comes
Tonight we're just worried about having fun
Cause we're the wild ones, yeah
You know that we're the wild ones
We're gonna always do it our way
And we don't care what nobody say
Cause we're the wildcats
We're the fighters
We're the midnight up all nighters
Everybody raise your glass
(Hey, hey, hey)
Pick it up and throw it back
Grab ahold of your honey
And everybody get a little lovin'
A little touchin'
A little kissin' and a huggin'
Do a little lovin'
Touchin'
A little kissin' and a huggin'
Cause we don't need no sleep tonight
Everybody's bumpin' to the beat just right
We'll worry 'bout tomorrow when tomorrow comes
Tonight we're just worried about having fun
Cause we're the wild ones, yeah
We're the wild ones
Everybody get a little lovin'
A little touchin'
A little kissin' and a huggin'
Do a little lovin'
Touchin'
A little kissin' and a huggin'
Cause we don't need no sleep tonight
Everybody's bumpin' to the beat just right
We'll worry 'bout tomorrow when tomorrow comes
Tonight we're just worried about having fun
Cause we're the wild ones
