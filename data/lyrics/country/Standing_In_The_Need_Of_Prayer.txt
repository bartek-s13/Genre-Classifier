It's me, it's me, it's me, oh Lord
Standing in the need of prayer
It's me, it's me, it's me, oh Lord
Standing in the need of prayer
Not my father, not my mother
But it's me, oh Lord
Standing in the need of prayer
Not my sister, not my brother
But it's me, oh Lord
Standing in the need of prayer
Not the people that are shoutin'
But it's me, oh Lord
Standing in the need of prayer
Not the members I've been doubting
But it's me, oh Lord
Standing in the need of prayer
Not the preacher, not the sinner
But it's me, oh Lord
Standing in the need of prayer
Not the deacon, not the teacher
But it's me, oh Lord
Standing in the need of prayer
