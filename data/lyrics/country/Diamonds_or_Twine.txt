"You know when you know," you hear that all your life
Well whoever they are, turns out they were right
Sunshine, the good times, yeah, we got a few behind us
But when the bad times come, I ain't gonna run

It doesn't matter if it's diamonds or twine
I'll be wrapped around your finger
Girl, you got me 'til we run out of time
Rich or poor, rain or shine
The wind's gonna blow wherever it goes
And the road is gonna wind
Doesn't matter if it's diamonds or twine
Forevermore, I'll be yours and you'll be mine

When I look at you now, I see all I ever wanted
You make me wanna hang around
And hold your hand, we're a hundred
You make love feel so real, so simple and honest
It's in every breath and every kiss
Yeah, the thing about you is

Doesn't matter if it's diamonds or twine
I'll be wrapped around your finger
Girl, you got me 'til we run out of time
Rich or poor, rain or shine
The wind's gonna blow wherever it goes
And the road is gonna wind
Doesn't matter if it's diamonds or twine
Forevermore, I'll be yours and you'll be mine

You'll be mine, baby
It don't matter where or whatever happens
Girl, I'll still be there

It doesn't matter if it's diamonds or twine
I'll be wrapped around your finger
Girl, you got me 'til we run out of time
Rich or poor, rain or shine
The wind's gonna blow wherever it goes
And the road is gonna wind
It doesn't matter if it's diamonds or twine (Diamonds or twine)
It doesn't matter if it's diamonds or twine
Forevermore, I'll be yours and you'll be mine

Diamonds or twine
