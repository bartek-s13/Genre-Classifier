Country DJs knows that I'm an outlaw
They'd never come to see me in this dive
Where bikers stare at cowboys who are laughing at the hippies
Who are praying they'll get out of here alive
The loud mouth in the corner's getting to me
Talking about my earrings and my hair
I guess he ain't read the signs that say that I been to prison
Someone ought to warn him before I knock him off his chair
Because my longhair just can't cover up my red neck
I've won every fight I've ever fought
Hey, I don't need some turkey telling me that I ain't country
And saying I ain't worth the damned old ticket that he bought
Because I can sing all them songs about Texas
And I still do all the sad ones that I know
They tell me, I look like Merle Haggard
And sound a lot like David Allen Coe
And the bar maid in the last town that we played in
Knew the words to every song I'd wrote
She said Jimmy Rabbit turned her on to my last album
Just about the time the jukebox broke
Yeah, Johnny Cash helped me get out of prison
Long before Rodriguez stole that goat
I've been the Rhinestone Cowboy for so long I can't remember
And I can do you every song Hank Williams ever wrote
And I can sing all them songs about Texas
And I still do all the sad ones that I know
I can't help it, I look like Merle Haggard
And I sound a lot like David Allen Coe
But the country deejays, all think I'm an outlaw
And they'd never come to see me in this dive
Where bikers stare at cowboys who are laughing at the hippies
Who are praying they'll get out of here alive
The loud mouth in the corner's getting to me
Talking about my earrings and my hair
