This nine pound hammer, it's a little too heavy
For my size, baby, for my size
I'm goin' on the mountain, gonna see my baby
But I ain't comin' back, well, I ain't comin' back
Roll on buddy, don't you roll so slow
Tell me, how can I roll, when the wheels won't go?
Roll on buddy, pull a load of coal
Now, how can I pull, when wheels won't roll?
It's a long way to Harlan, it's a long way to Hazard
Just to get a little brew, just to get a little brew
Well, when I'm long gone you can make my tombstone
Outta number nine coal, outta number nine coal
Hey, roll on buddy, don't you roll so slow
How can I roll, when the wheels won't go?
Roll on buddy, pull your load of coal
Tell me, how can I pull, when wheels won't roll?
