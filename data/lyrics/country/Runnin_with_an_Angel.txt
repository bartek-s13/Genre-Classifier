No one could ever say we lacked in passion
Truth is we were burning like a flame
Looking back, I couldn't tell you when it happened
Has it been 20 years, or 20 days
Should've picked her over whiskey
Layed down my foolish pride
I know it felt different when she kissed me
I guess I've never been a kiss goodbye
Well I've tried other women
They never felt the same
But I think what hurts the most is knowing I'm to blame
And I wish that I could change it
And it wouldn't be this painful
'Cause the truth is that the devil had no business runnin' with an angel
Well your eyes are like a north Alabama sunset
And your smiles like Florida in the Spring
I keep on booking shows, but you ain't come yet
Even though you're in every song I sing
Can't say I don't deserve it
For putting you through hell
People keep asking if it was worth it
I tell them this, it's still to soon to tell
Well I've tried every whiskey
From Jim to Jack to Crown
But losing you is the only thing that burns me going down
And I wish that I could change it
And it wouldn't be this painful
'Cause the truth is that the devil had no business runnin' with an angel
Truth is you're better off alone
And the best thing I can do is let you go
Holding you was heaven, but losing you was hell
I should've known the devil had no business, runnin' with an angel
Runnin' with an angel
Runnin' with an angel
