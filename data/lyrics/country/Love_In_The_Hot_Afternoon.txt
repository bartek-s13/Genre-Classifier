From somewhere outside, I hear the street vendor cry
"Filé gumbo"
From my window, I see him
Going down the street
And he don't know
That she fell right to sleep
In the damp tangled sheets, so soon
After love in, the hot, afternoon

Now the bourbon street lady
Sleeps like a baby
In the shadows (In the shadows)
She was new to me
Full of mystery
But now I know (But now I know)
That she's just a girl
And I'm just a guy
In a room
For love, in the hot, afternoon

We got high in the park
This morning and we sat, without talkin'
Then we came back here
In the heat of the day, tired of walkin'
Where under her breath
She hummed to herself, a tune
Of love, in the hot, afternoon
