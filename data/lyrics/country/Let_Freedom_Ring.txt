Let freedom ring
Let freedom ring
My country this of thee
Sweet land of liberty
Of thee I see
Land where my fathers died
Land of the pilgrim's pride
From every mountain side
Let freedom ring
My native country thee
Land of the noble free
Thy name I love
I love thy rocks and rills
Thy woods and templed hills
My hear with rapture thrills
Like that above
Let freedom ring
Great god our king
From sea to shining sea
Let freedom ring
So let music swell the breeze
And ring from all the trees
Sweet freedom song
Let mortal tongues awake
Let all that breathe partake
Let rocks their silence break
The sound prolong
Let freedom ring
Great god our king
From sea to shining sea
Let freedom ring
Our father's God to thee
Author of liberty
To thee we sing
Long may our land be bright
With freedoms holy light
Protect us by thy might
Great god our king
Let freedom ring
Pray god our king
From sea to shining sea
Let freedom ring
Let freedom ring
Great god our king
From sea to shining sea
Let freedom ring
Oh great god our king
Let freedom ring
