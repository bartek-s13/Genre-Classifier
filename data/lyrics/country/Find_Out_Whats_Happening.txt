Baby you know me well you know I mean what I say
Before I say farewell I'll give you just one more day
So you can find out what's happening find out what's happening before long
If you don't find out what's happening you're gonna find out that I'm gone
Tell me what you're gonna do you better make up your mind
It all depends on you or I'm leaving you behind
You'd better find out what's happening...
Baby you know it's true we've been through thick and thin
But if you don't come through you won't ever see me again
You'd better find out what's happening find out what's happening before long
If you don't find out what's happening you're gonna find your daddy gone
Find out what's happening find out what's happening find out what's happening
