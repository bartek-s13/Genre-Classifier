I ain't watching TV today
Bad news, it can just stay away
If you ain’t got anything good to say
Then shut your mouth
I got my windows down and my blinders on
Radio set to my favorite song
All green lights on the road I'm on
Man, there ain't no doubt

I’m getting them good vibes
I'm living this good life
I'm breathing on God's time
And I ain't gonna waste one breath
I'm soaking it all up
I got me a full cup
And there ain't nothing gonna spill it
Nothing gonna kill it
Waving them worries goodbye
I'm feeling them good vibes

I ain’t tryna hear the negative
I’m just tryna change the narrative
It's simply imperative
That we all have a damn good time

I’m getting them good vibes
I'm living this good life
I'm breathing on God's time
And I ain’t gonna waste one breath
I'm soaking it all up
I got me a full cup
And there ain't nothing gonna spill it
Nothing gonna kill it
Waving them worries goodbye
I'm feeling them good vibes
Oh, I'm feeling them good vibes

I got a good girl
She got a good smile
I kiss her good morning
I kiss her good night
We keep it on the up
That's how we get down
So don't be coming around

Unless you got them good vibes
I'm living this good life
I'm breathing on God's time
And I ain't gonna waste one breath
I'm soaking it all up
I got me a full cup
And there ain't nothing gonna spill it
Nothing gonna kill it
Waving them worries goodbye
I'm feeling them good vibes
I'm breathing on God's time
And I ain't gonna waste one breath
I'm soaking it all up
I got me a full cup
And there ain't nothing gonna spill it
Nothing gonna kill it
Waving them worries goodbye
I'm feeling them good vibes
Oh, I'm feeling them good vibes
Yeah
