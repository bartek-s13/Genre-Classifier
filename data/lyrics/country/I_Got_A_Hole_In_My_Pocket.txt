I got a hole in my pocket and I can't go to the fair
I got a hole in my pocket and I can't go to the fair
I'm blue cause I had a date to meet my baby there
When I don't show up well what'll my baby do
When I don't show up well what'll my baby do
She'll travel through the tunnel of love with someone new
Oooo Oooo what'll I do my money's all gone
Baby baby it's true
I got a hole in my pocket I don't know what to do
I got a hole in my pocket and my money just runs on through
I got a hole in my pocket and my money just runs on through
Can't seem to save a dollar like my baby dollie wants me too
Well I told my baby we could have a little fun tonight
Well I told my baby we could have a little fun tonight
But it won't be so funny when there ain't a bit of money in sight
Oooo Oooo what'll I do my money's all gone
Baby baby it's true
I got a hole in my pocket I don't know what to do
Oooo Oooo what'll I do my money's all gone
Baby baby it's true
I got a hole in my pocket I don't know what to do
I got a hole in my pocket an' I don't know what to do
