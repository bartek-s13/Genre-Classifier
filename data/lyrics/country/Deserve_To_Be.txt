More than a small-town everyday girl I see with her hair pulled back
You're more than a part-time don't-pay job at the diner across them tracks
Wanna pull you out from behind them shades
Break all your rules yeah it's time for a change
Get you out of that one-way, one-light town you deserve to be

First class high on an airplane
Drinks in Italy baby while we sunbathe
Learnin' some Spanish let's go uno, dos, tres, ondelay kinda thing
It's the grinnin' from the top of the Eiffel
Holdin' your hand down a New York sidewalk
Northern lights and stars shootin' down when you're next to me
My world, you deserve to be, yeah, yeah

I know you had dreams of life outside this corn field, high school glory days kinda place
I know you've been savin' money up in your top drawer hoping to make it out someday
Girl if you can see what I see
You know for sure you deserve to be

First class high on an airplane
Drinks in Italy baby while we sunbathe
Learnin' some Spanish let's go uno, dos, tres, ondelay kinda thing
It's the grinnin' from the top of the Eiffel
Holdin' your hand down a New York sidewalk
Northern lights and stars shootin' down when you're next to me
My world, you deserve to be, yeah, yeah

First class high on an airplane
Sangria, white sand, beach sunbathing
Learnin' some Spanish uno, dos, tres, ondelay kinda thing
It's the grinnin' from the top of the Eiffel
Holdin' your hand down a New York side walk
Northern lights and stars shootin' down when you're next to me
My world, you deserve to be

Girl you're more than you think you are yeah
Yeah, yeah
