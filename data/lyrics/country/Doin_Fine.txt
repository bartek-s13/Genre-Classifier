Daddy got sober, Mama got his best friend
I've cut down crying to every other weekend
Thanks for asking how I've been
I've gotten too good at hiding it
With an "I'm okay", "things are great"
But the truth is
Yeah, the truth is

I'm doin' fine enough to know that everyone's a little broken
Fine enough to learn that hearts are best when they're wide open
I still got fear inside of me
I'm not okay, but I'm gonna be alright
For the first time, in a long time, I'm doin' fine
I'm doin' fine

Daddy signed the papers the day I turned 19
And Mama drove north to find a new beginning
I blamed God, I blamed myself
Then I found my knees and prayed like hell
It's funny how a touch of grace gives you healing
Yeah, I'm healing

I'm doin' fine enough to know that everyone's a little broken
Fine enough to learn that hearts are best when they're wide open
I still got fear inside of me
I'm not okay, but I'm gonna be alright
For the first time, in a long time, I'm doin' fine
I'm doin' fine, oh-oh, oh-oh
All these old pains
And I wish they'd go away
But I guess you can't be free without a fight

I'm doin' fine enough to know that everyone's a little broken
Fine enough to learn hearts are best when they're wide open
I still got fear inside of me
I'm not okay, but I'm gonna be alright
Oh, for the first time, in a long, long time, I'm doin' fine
I'm doin' fine
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Daddy got sober, Mama got his best friend
But I'm doin' fine
Yeah, yeah
