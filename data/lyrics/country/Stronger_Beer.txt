We eat Smarties, you eat M&M's
You think all our money looks pretend
Yeah, we got Bryan Adams but, hey, you got Bruce Springsteen
But we can drink in bars when we're just nineteen
You got Brad Pitt we got Keanu Reeves
But we got the best lake fishing you best believe
You make fun of us cause we spell "colour" with a "U"
You think you’re all that, Mister Red, White, and Blue
We say, "Eh?" You say, "Y'all."
Yeah, we both got pro football, 'cept we got bigger balls and a longer field (and one less down)
We say "zed", you say "zee"
Sure we watch all your TV
You got stronger army down there but man up here
We got stronger beer
You got Dunkin’ Donuts we got Timmy’s
We got more land but, bro, you got more cities
You sure love the NFL, MLB and the NBA but to the Great White North hockey is the only game
We say, "Eh?" You say, "Y'all."
Yeah, we both got pro football, 'cept we got bigger balls and a longer field (and one less down)

All kiddin' aside
It takes me six beers to get pissed drunk, but for you it takes nine. Sucker!
