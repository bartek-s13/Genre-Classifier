Know there's a light that glows by the front door
Don't forget the key is under the mat
Watch how the stars shine
Always stay humble and kind
Go to church cause your mama says to
Visit Grandpa every chance that you can
It won't be wasted time
Always stay humble and kind

Hold the door, say please, say thank you
Don't steal, don't cheat, and don't lie
I know you got mountains to climb
But always stay humble and kind
When the dreams that you're dreaming come true
When the work you put in is realized
Let yourself feel the pride
But always stay humble and kind

Don't expect a free ride from no one
Don't hold or a chip, and here's why
Bitterness keeps you from flying
Always stay humble and kind
Know the difference between sleeping with someone
And sleeping with someone you love
I love you ain't no pick-up-line
So, always stay humble and kind
Hold the door, say please, say thank you
Don't steal, don't cheat, and don't lie
I know you got mountains to climb
But always stay humble and kind
When these dreams that you're dreaming come true
When the work you put in is realized
Let yourself feel the pride
But always stay humble and kind

When it's hot eat a root beer popsicle
Shut off the AC and roll the windows down
And let the summer sun shine
Always stay humble and kind
Don't take for granted the love this life gives you
Where you get where you're going turn right back around
And help the next one in line
Always stay humble and kind
