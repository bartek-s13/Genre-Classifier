Sometimes I feel like I'm the new kid in town
That never had a chance to settle down
Are you here to stay? where'd you get those shoes?
Why you walking around with new city blues?

People talking never make a sound
Ma ears only burn when they're not around
Go on believing, what am I to do?
It's only people talking it's not true

Sometimes I feel like an old familiar tune
When's the record gonna change
'Cause it's never gonna change too soon
Why are you still here?
There's no one that you haven't been through
Your welcome is warning your day
Is well past due

People talking never make a sound
My ears only burn when they're not around
Go on believing, what am I to do?
It's only people talking it's not true
And I'd like to say that it don't bother me at all
But sometimes I wish that I felt like I belong

People talking never make a sound
Ma ears only burn when they're not around
Go on believing, what am I to do?
It's only people talking it's not true
