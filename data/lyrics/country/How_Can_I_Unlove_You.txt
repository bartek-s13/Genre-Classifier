How can I unsay the things I said to you?
How can I undo the things that we used to do?
Tell me, how can I unfeel the way I feel for you?
How can I-I-I-I unlove you?
How can I untie the hold that you got on me
When you won't unchain my heart and set me free?
I can't unremember every memory
So how can I-I-I-I unlove you?
I'll never, never uncry
The tears that I cried when you said goodbye
No, I'll never, never unmiss
The thrill that I missed when we used to kiss
How can I unsay the things I said to you?
And how can I undo the things that we used to do?
Tell me how, can I unfeel the way I feel for you?
How can I-I-I-I unlove you?
Whoa, I'll never, never uncry
The tears that I cried when you said goodbye
No, I'll never, never unmiss
The thrill that I missed when we used to kiss, whoa
How can I unsay the things I said to you?
And how can I undo the things that we used to do?
Tell me, how can I unfeel the way I feel for you?
How can I-I-I-I unlove you?
How can I-I-I-I unlove you?
How can I-I-I-I unlove you?
How can I-I-I-I unlove you?
