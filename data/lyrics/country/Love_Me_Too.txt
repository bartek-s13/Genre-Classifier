If I called you perfect
If I called you mine
If I had the sense
I'd use my sight
Drive through the desert
Just to see you at night
We'd talk for hours 'til we'd sleep side by side
Side by side
Close your eyes
Count to three
Dream of the way it should be
And I'll hold my breath
'Til the mornin'
To watch you walk away
If I put it out there
Laid it all on the line
Would you tell me you love me too, and that you'll stay mine?
Mine all mine
Close your eyes
Count to three
And dream of the way it should be
No holdin' my breath
'Til the mornin'
To watch you walk away
I'm not watchin' you walk away
If I called you
Would you tell me
You love me too
If I called you
Would you tell me
You love me too
(I love you too)
