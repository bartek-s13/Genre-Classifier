She Drove up to the restaurant
Where they used to dine
He was sittin at the table
With someone new this time
She walked up right beside him
Her face did not turn red
She looked at him so calmly, and this is what she said:
Good as i was to you, is this the thanks i get?
Are all the years we shared, so easy to forget?
Does this mean that you've won?
Are you finally having fun?
Is she your dream come true?
Oh, she sure looks good, but she won't ever be
Good as i was to you
The room got awful quiet, Everybody stared
Finally the waiter said, "should i bring another chair?"
She said "no i was just leavin' "
But as she walked out the door
She said "honey, you can have him, I dont want him anymore."
Good as i was to you, is this the thanks i get?
Are all the years we shared, So easy to forget?
Is the way its done, lookin out for number one?
Did you think it through?
Oh, she sure looks good, but she won't never be GOOD as i was to you
Does this mean that you've won?
Are you finally havin' fun?
Is she your dream come true?
Oh she sure looks good, but she won't ever be good as i was to you
Good as I was to you
