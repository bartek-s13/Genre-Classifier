Man this world sure has changed
But is it for the better?
Ain't no rules, no prayer in school
Values are just what ever
Somethin' new every week
Protests turn to riots in the streets
Ain't even sure of what they believe
But it must be true if it's on TV

When we gonna wake up?
Enough's enough
Can't you see where we went wrong?
They tried keepin' us divided
'Cause united we are strong
People takin' a knee, makin' everyone see
We're takin' for granted this freedom we're handed
And the writin's on the wall
We better stand before we fall
Wake up

Blessed is a nation who's God is the Lord
But we think we know better
The path we're on fans the devils flames
We can see it in the weather
No respect for privacy
Got people doin' whatever they hell they please
And now we need more security
If you believe everything you ready
When we gonna wake up?
Enough's enough
Can't you see where we went wrong?
They tried keepin' us divided
'Cause united we are strong
People takin' a knee, makin' everyone see
We're takin' for granted this freedom we're handed
And the writin's on the wall
We better stand before we fall
Wake up

How'd we let it get this far?
Are you ready for the worst?
Some are changin' who they are
Others start a war with words
How'd we let it get this far?
Are you ready for the worst?
Some are changin' who they are
Others start a war with words

Yeah, wake up
Enough's enough
Can't you see where we went wrong?
They tried keepin' us divided
'Cause united we are strong
People takin' a knee, makin' everyone see
We're takin' for granted this freedom we're handed
And the writin's on the wall
We better stand before we fall
Wake up
We better stand before we fall
Yeah, wake up
