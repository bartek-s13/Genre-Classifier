I've never seen the inside of a bar room
Or listened to a jukebox all night long
But I see these are the things that bring you pleasure
So I'm gonna make some changes in our home
I've heard it said if you can't beat'em join'em
So if that's the way you've wanted me to be
I'll change if it takes that to make you happy
From now on you're gonna see a different me
Because your good girl's gonna go bad
I'm gonna be the swingin'est swinger you've ever had
If you like'em painted up powdered up then you ought to be glad
Cause your good girl's gonna go bad
I'll even learn to like the taste of whiskey
In fact you'll hardly regonize your wife
I buy some brand new clothes and dress up fancy
For my journey to the wilder side of life
Because your good girl's gonna go bad
I'm gonna be the swingin'est swinger you've ever had
If you like'em painted up powdered up then you ought to be glad
Because your good girl'd gonna go bad
Oh yeah your good girls gonna go bad
