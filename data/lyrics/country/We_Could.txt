If any one could find the joy
That true love brings a girl and boy
We could, we could, you and I
If any one could ever say
That their true love was here to stay
We could, we could, you and I
When you're in my arms I know
You're happy to be there
And just just as long as I'm with you
I'm happy any where
If any one could pray each night
To thank the Lord cause all is right
We could, we could, you and I
