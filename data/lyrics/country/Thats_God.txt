Have you ever stepped outside, felt the sun on your face?
Seen the waters of the ocean,reach so far they start to fade?
Have you ever seen a mountain top reach up and kiss the sky?
That's God
Have you ever seen the wonder in the eyes of a child?
Or felt the way the room lights up with that tiny little smile?
Witnessed their amazement at the simplest of things?
That's God
If you take the time to look around, you'll see it everywhere
It's right here all around us, even when we're not aware
It doesn't have to be a miracle
It might just be the little things
And even those who say they don't believe
They may not know it but everyday they see...
That's God
Have you ever heard a song and reached inside your soul?
It says what you can't say - let's you know you're not alone
You find the inspiration to keep on holdin' on
That's God
If you take the time to look around
You'll see it everywhere
It's right here all around us
Even when we're not aware
It doesn't have to be a miracle
It might just be the little things
And even those who say they don't believe
They may not know it but everyday they see...
That's God
Oh, when people make a difference just being who they are
Or when someone wants to lend a helping hand
Maybe it's somebody who just takes the time to listen to let you know that they understand
Have you ever known a love that opens up your heart
Selfless and encouraging to help you reach the stars
Patient and forgiving and accepts you as you are?
That's God
