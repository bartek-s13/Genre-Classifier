I was born in '94
Daddy drove a beat up Ford
Mama made it run on love and music
The backseat’s where I started singing
All the songs that got me dreaming
I'd scream "turn it up," and then I'd lose it

I was raised on radio waves
Where the ladies dominated
Sometimes I close my eyes and just replay it

I just wanna feel like ladies in the 90’s
Turn the dial and find me some Strawberry Wine
So I can sing all night long, acting like I'm Britney
Come on baby, hit me just one more time, hey
Man, I feel like a woman
I can feel you breathe when you say my name
Hey, I don't want no scrubs
Need a cowboy to take me away
I wanna feel like ladies in the 90's
Ladies in the 90's, hey hey hey

Diva in the living room
Mama's heels on after school
Learning all my moves on MTV
They weren't afraid to make a statement
That's what I call entertainment
All those women paved the way for me

Yeah, southern twang
Teased up bangs
I was matching all their lipstick
Close my eyes all the time
I wish I could relive it, yeah yeah

I just wanna feel like ladies in the 90’s
Turn the dial and find me some Strawberry Wine
So I can sing all night long, acting like I’m Britney
Come on baby, hit me just one more time
Hey, man I feel like a woman
I can feel you breathe when you say my name
Hey, I don't want no scrubs
Need a cowboy to take me away
I wanna feel like ladies in the 90’s (Let's go, girls)
Ladies in the 90's, hey hey hey

Wearing leopard leotards
Singing about broken hearts
Moving on in leather pants so shiny
Females were unstoppable
Can't say that’s impossible
My heart will always be stuck in the 90's, yeah

I just wanna feel like ladies in the 90s
Turn the dial and find me some Strawberry Wine
So I can sing all night long, acting like I'm Britney
Come on baby, hit me just one more time, hey
Here's your one chance, Fancy
Genie in a bottle, then Vogue
I'll tell you what I want, what I really really want
You oughta know
I wanna feel like ladies in the 90's
Ladies in the 90's, hey hey hey

I wanna feel like ladies in the 90's
Ladies in the 90's, hey hey hey
