I'm not gonna be a joke
I know about your side piece, bro
I’m not gonna fight anymore, yeah
Glad I never had your baby
This'll be a cleaner cut
You can keep the labradors

'Cause you wasted my time
Been two nights, the last night
I’m gonna waste a damn good rhyme on you

Have a, have a, have a good life
Have a, have a, have a good life
You had a, had a, had a good life
(You gave it up for hoes)
Have a, have a, have a good life
You're never gonna have it good twice
Have a, have a, have a good life
(That's how the good life goes)

Sick I ever touched your body
Sick you ever tasted mine
I should burn the sheets on my bed
I don't want an explanation
I don't wanna still be friends
I just wanna break your neck

'Cause you wasted my time
Been two nights, the last night
I'm gonna waste a damn good line on you

Have a, have a, have a good life
Have a, have a, have a good life
You had a, had a, had a good life
(You gave it up for hoes)
Have a, have a, have a good life
You're never gonna have it good twice
Have a, have a, have a good life
(That’s how the good life goes)

You was living in a dream, dude, in zone
I watched you walking with your keys and your Benzo
Credit card for your bros at the chateau
I got the checks while you checked out on me slow
You didn’t care that all I wanted was a safe zone
Couldn't treat me like a queen or a friend, oh
Couldn’t keep your eyes on me in the end, oh
Cut you off, let you crawl to the next hoe

'Cause you wasted my time
But tonight's the last night
I'm gonna waste a damn good life on you

Have a, have a, have a good life
Have a good life
You had a good life
(You gave it up for hoes)
Have a, have a, have a good life
You’re never gonna have it good twice
Have a, have a, have a good life
(That's how the good life goes)
So have a, have a, have a good life
Have a, have a, have a good life
You had a, had a, had a good life
(You gave it up for hoes)
Have a, have a, have a good life
You're never gonna have it this good twice
Have a, have a, have a good life
(That's how the good life goes)
