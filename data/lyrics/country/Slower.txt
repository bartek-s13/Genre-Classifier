There's never enough time in the day
And those hands on the clock don't take a break
Seems like I don't need love these days
And that freeway, speedway, high speed chase
Makes it hard to hit the brakes
But she knows how to make my heart race

Just a little slower
Take my time when I get to hold her
Heaven feels a little closer
With her head right on my shoulder
Next to her when the fire burns
And my world turns just a little slower

The more I know, the more I like
She gets finer like a bottle of wine
Feels so good, it gets better with time
Oh, the highest highs ain't never end
Don't know how she does it but
It's magic when she makes the sun set

Just a little slower
Take my time when I get to hold her
Heaven feels a little closer
With her head right on my shoulder
Next to her when the fire burns
And my world turns just a little slower
I know one day I'll look back on my life
And look into her eyes, watch it all flash by
Wish that we could do it one more time

Just a little slower
Oh, just a little slower
Take my time when I get to hold her
Heaven feels a little closer
With her head right on my shoulder
Oh, next to her when the fire burns
And my world turns just a little slower
Just a little slower
