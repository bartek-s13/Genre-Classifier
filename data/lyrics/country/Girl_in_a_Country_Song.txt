No country music was harmed in the making of this song
This is only a test-t-t

Well, I wish I had some shoes on my two bare feet
And it's getting kinda cold in these painted on cut-off jeans
I hate the way this bikini top chafes
Do I really have to wear it all day? (Yeah, baby)

I hear you over there on your tailgate whistlin' 
Sayin', "Hey, girl" (Hey, girl)
But you know I ain't listenin'
'Cause I got a name
And to you, it ain't "Pretty little thing"
"Hottie" or "Baby"
It's driving me red-red-red-red-red-red-redneck crazy

Being the girl in a country song
How in the world did it go so wrong?
Like all I'm good for is lookin' good for
You and your friends on the weekend, nothin' more
We used to get a little respect
Now we're lucky if we even get
To climb up in your truck, keep our mouths shut, and ride along
And be the girl in a country song

Well, shakin' my moneymaker ain't never made me a dime
And there ain't no sugar for you in this shaker of mine
Tell me one more time "You gotta get you some of that"
Sure, I'll slide on over, but you're gonna get slapped (Ha)
These days, it ain't easy bein' that

Girl in a country song
How in the world did it go so wrong?
Like all I'm good for is lookin' good for
You and your friends on the weekend, nothin' more
We used to get a little respect
Now we're lucky if we even get
To climb up in your truck, keep our mouths shut, and ride along
And be the girl in a country song

(Yep, yep, yeah, baby)
Aw, naw, Conway and George Strait
Never did it this way
Back in the old days
Aw, y'all, we ain't a cliché
That ain't no way to treat a lady

Like a girl in a country song
How in the world did it go so wrong?
Like all we're good for
Is looking good for you and your friends on the weekend
Nothin' more (Woo)
We used to get a little respect
Now we're lucky if we even get
To climb up in your truck, keep our mouth shut, and ride along
Down some old dirt road we don't even wanna be on
And be the girl in a country song (Yeah, baby)

I ain't your tan-legged Juliet!
Can I put on some real clothes now?
Aw, naw (Haha)
