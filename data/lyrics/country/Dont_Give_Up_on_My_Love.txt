You said underneath your breath
That you didn't really know
Didn't really know if this is worth it
And I said as I crawled out of your bed
That if I could, I promise that I would take it all back

Your love is a fire
And I need the burn, need the burn
I know I'm a liar
And I don't deserve, don't deserve you

Please, don't give up, don't give up on my love
Please, don't give up, don't give up on my love
Don't give up, don't give up on my love
Don't give up, don't give up

You said that you didn't give a damn
'Bout the money or the fame
If it's gonna change us, you wanna run away
And I said that I would understand
'Cause I know it's just a dream
And if you wanna leave, baby, I would leave today

The high and the lows
And all the in between, in between
I want you to know
That you're my everything, everything

Please, don't give up, don't give up on my love
Please, don't give up, don't give up on my love
Don't give up, don't give up on my love
Don't give up, don't give up on my love

Hey, yeah
Ooh
Please, don't give up, don't give up on my love
Please, don't give up on my love

Please, don't give up, don't give up on my love
Please, don't give up, don't give up on my love
Please, don't give up, don't give up on my love
Don't give up, don't give up
Please, don't give up, don't give up on my love
Please, don't give up, don't give up on my love
