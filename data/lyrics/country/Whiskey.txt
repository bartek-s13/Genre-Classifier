Everybody down in Houston calls him "Texas"
Everybody way up North calls him "Cornbread"
You shoulda heard the way that his momma called him "baby"
Daddy called him "boy", his friends call him "crazy"

Shoulda just called it like I saw it
Shoulda just called for help and ran like hell that day
The burn and the sting, and the high, and the heat
And the left-me-wanting-more feeling when he kissed me
I shoulda just called him "whiskey"

Warm my body to the core just like a blanket
His face was so sweet then he took my breath away
Hit me so hard like a rock through a window
I knew I was in trouble from the moment I met you, boy

Shoulda just called it like I saw it
Shoulda just called for help and ran like hell that day
The burn and the sting, and the high, and the heat
And the left-me-wanting-more feeling when he kissed me
I shoulda just called him "whiskey"
Now the numb has set in
He's gone like the wind
And I can barely feel the pain

Shoulda just called it like I saw it
Shoulda just called for help and ran like hell that day
The burn and the sting, and the high, and the heat
And the left-me-wanting-more feeling when he kissed me
I shoulda just called him "whiskey"
I shoulda just called him "whiskey"
I shoulda just called him "whiskey"
