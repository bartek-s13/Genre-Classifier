Just a small town Cinderella
Daddy wants you back home by midnight
Every time we're together
Yeah that's my dilemma
I need more time with you
I wanna watch the sun
Rise through the pines with you

Night like this, wouldn't wanna' miss
Moonlight shining on a long slow kiss
You could be the one, I could get lucky with
If the boot fits

Woah, diamonds in the sky lighting up those eyes
Like woah, you're the kind of fine that I can't deny
It gets me high, cross my heart hope to die
Pick a star make a wish
Yeah girl, you can be my all night
Dancing in the headlights
Fairytale good as it gets
If the boot fits

Yeah, baby, we can run away
My carriage is a 4x4 400-horse Chevrolet
You're like a princess
In a blue cotton dress
I can be your prince
If the boot fits
Woah, diamonds in the sky lighting up those eyes
Like woah, you're the kind of fine that I can't deny
It gets me high, cross my heart hope to die
Pick a star make a wish
Yeah girl, you can be my all night
Dancing in the headlights
Fairytale good as it gets
If the boot fits

Woah
Let me show a country boy treats a lady
Woah
Go ahead kick 'em off cos the boot fits lady

Woah, diamonds in the sky lighting up those eyes
Like woah, you're the kind of fine that I can't deny
It gets me high, cross my heart hope to die
Pick a star make a wish
Yeah girl, you can be my all night
Dancing in the headlights
Fairytale good as it gets
If the boot fits
Woah, if the boot fits
Yeah, if the boot fits
