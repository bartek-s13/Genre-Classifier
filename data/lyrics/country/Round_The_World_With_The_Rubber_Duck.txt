Breaker, one-nine, this here's the Duck again. You got a copy on me Pig Pen, c'mon? Ah, negatory, Pig Pen, there ain't no way out 'cept for that one Atlantic Ocean. Now listen, drop them hogs off in Omaha and get over here in a short, 'cause it definitely looks like we got us a problem
Bears to the left; bears to the right
We didn't have no place to go
They had us backed up clean to the shore
And them cab-over Petes don't float
I says, "Pig Pen, I got me a good idea
Them Friends a' Jesus gonna save us!
"So praise the Lord and Mister Ford
And follow that micra-bus, ten-four


Yo ho ho, and a thousand trucks
Gonna take a bath with a Rubber Duck
Yo ho ho, and a lots a' luck
'Round the world with the Rubber Ducky!
Yeah, we drove on the water like diesel whales
Sank about a hunnert-and-ten of 'em
I says, "Pig Pen, they just didn't have no faith
"They definitely gone ten-seven."
By the time we got into that Piccadilly Town
'Bout half of 'em was lost at sea
I says, "Break one-nine for a ten-thirty-three"
What we got was the cotton-pickin' BBC
I say, Fabersham. Looks likes the Americans have got themselves another bloody Convoy

Yo ho ho, and a thousand trucks
Gonna take a bath with a Rubber Duck
Yo ho ho, and a lots a' luck
'Round the world with the Rubber Ducky!

Good heavens! Look at them all! Half of them are sinking in the Thames! Hello! Some of our truck chaps are assisting them. Good show, actually. Oh, well, ten-four and all that rubbish
Well, we crossed that Channel like snakes on glass
And stormed the beach about dawn
I says, "Grab your shifters and punch 13
"We all goin' truckin' on the Autobahn
"Now, Pig Pen, this here's the ultimate slab
"'Cause there goes a Mercedes truck."
He says, "Break one-three for the Strudel Machine
"Ya just blew the doors off'n the Duck. How 'bout it?"

Oh, zehn-vier, Rubber Duck. Ve are receiving you vall-to-vall, but the schpeed limit on za Autobahn is triple-nickels. You travel too schlow, Rubber Duck. We gonna see you around. We gone. Wiedersehen

Well, we stopped for a coffee in West Berlin
Dumb, dumb, dumb. This is
The British had hundred-mile tea
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
I says, "Pig Pen, from here on it's wall-to-wall bears."
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Says, "Bash the Wall; we gonna see."
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Well, them big red bears must'a been in the bush
Dumb, dumb, dumb. This is
'Cause we didn't see a one all day
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
So we raked up the leaves and we shook out the tree
Dumb, dumb, dumb. This is
'Til they finally had something to say
Dumb, dumb, dumb
You got it..
Comrade Duck: you have been given until daybreak in Murmansk to get your cotton-pickin' trucks out of the U. S. S. of R. You will copy!

Well, we shot them rigs through salt-mine city
Dumb, dumb
With a hammer and a sickle on down
Dumb, dumb
Then we hit the fan through the Sea of Japan
Dumb, dumb
Tooled into Transistor Town
Dumb, dumb
I says, "Pig Pen, this here must be the place
Dumb, dumb
"'Cause everybody's eatin' with sticks."
Dumb, dumb
He says, "Ten-Four, this here is CB land
Dumb, dumb
"'Cause my channel knob just went crick."
Dumb, dumb

Ah so, Lubba Duck. You have a nice day today, betta day tomollow. We catch you on frip-frop. This one Kamikaze Ozzie; we gone. Sayonara

Yo ho ho, and a thousand trucks
Gonna take a bath with a Lubba Duck
Yo ho ho, and a rots a' ruck
'Round the world with a Lubba Ducky!
Ah, ten-four, Pig Pen, what's your twenty? Australia? Mercy sakes, ain't nothin' down there but Tasmanian devils and them Q-alla bears. What's that? No double-nickel limit? We gonna be there in a short, Pig Pen. This here's the Rubber Duck, ten-ten and doin' it to it like Pruitt used'ta do it to it. We gone. 'Bye-'bye
