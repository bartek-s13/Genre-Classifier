Verse 1
You look so good, In that dress
I don’t think that you can ever look your best
Every time I see you, you lookin better than the last
Every time I see you girl I’m just so taken back
Then the words in the dictionary
To describe your vibes and how you got me feelin lately
I try to find the right lines but they just come up missin
Every time your by my side I just want your kisses
Hook
Your body is my destination
I want you bad but I’m hesitatin
I’m sorry girl to leave you waitin
To tell you how I feel but I don’t know how to say it
Chorus
Please save me, cuz I’m just so lost
Girl, please save me, cuz I’m too far gone
I’m so speechless
It’s no secret
Like a star in the sky I can’t reach it
Girl please save me, save me cuz I’m just so lost
Verse 2
Can’t find the words my heart gets weak
I lose my breath, it’s hard to speak
Every time I see you, I wanna tell you how I feel
I would rather show you so that you can know it’s real
Your beauty is so captivatin
Every time I run into you my heart gets to racing
And I try to catch myself cuz were not even dating
And the time to win your heart and love is slowly fading
Hook 2
I run out words when you’re walking
Let our bodies do the talking
I’m trippin tumbling and falling
Feelin all out but I wanna be in
Chorus
Girl please save me cuz I’m just so lost
Girl please save me cuz I’m too far gone
I’m so speechless
It’s no secret
Like a star in the sky I can’t reach it
Girl please save me, save me cuz I’m just so lost
Girl please save me cuz I’m just so lost (hey)
Girl please save me cuz I’m too far gone
Im so speechless (so speechless)
Its no secret
Like a star in the sky I can’t reach it
Girl please save me, save me cuz I’m just so lost
