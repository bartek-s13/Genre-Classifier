You know I never like going to a sequel
Somehow the second one never is equal to the first one
Same, lame heard 'em all before lines
Put it on repeat-peat one more time
I know a bad rerun when I see one
Like you coming around saying

Hey girl what do you say
Wanna do a do over?
I swear I've changed
You only want a toy for you to enjoy
But you ain't nothin but basic boy
No way, No how
Let me make it crystal right now
I got a brand new know myself attitude
And I don't need another, 'nother you part 2
Don't need another, 'nother you part 2

Maybe I can refresh your memory
Play it in your mind blow it up like a big screen
How it all went down
Kiss, kiss but the lips aren't mine
Cover girl stains on your alibi
Ain't doing what I did before
Boy, step away from my front door
Sayin
Hey girl what do you say
Wanna do a do over?
I swear I've changed
You only want a toy for you to enjoy
But you ain't nothin but basic boy
No way, No how
Let me make it crystal right now
I got a brand new know myself attitude
And I don't need another, 'nother you part 2
Don't need another, 'nother you part 2

Another you part 2?
No I'll never do that
Like a one hit wonder, all done
Run, tell that
Quit beg beg beggin me please
Like a fool get up, up off of your knees
You're a broke down truck
I'm a new Range Rover
Cruisin in the sunshine
Boy you know you gotta be drunk
You better get sober
Ain't no overtime baby
This is over
Lemme hear you say "yeah yeah"

Give it up boy
Quit coming around saying

Hey girl what do you say
Wanna do a do over?
I swear I've changed
You only want a toy for you to enjoy
But you ain't nothin but basic boy
No way, No how
Let me make it crystal right now
I got a brand new know myself attitude
And I don't need another, 'nother you part 2
Don't need another, 'nother you part 2
Lemme hear you say "yeah yeah"
