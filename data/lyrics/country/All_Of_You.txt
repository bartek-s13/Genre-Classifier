I've been contemplating my life
What I believe in and what I've been taught
And believe in of late
You see it's never worried me up until now
Now that I've found what I'm searching for
So, If you choose always me
I'll make a promise to choose all of you
And, If you will follow me now
I'll be always there to follow you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Feeling sorry all my life for families with hardship
Families with sorrows, families with flaws
Maybe they were sorry for me
For I never found what they had already
Found what they were searching for
So, If you choose always me
I'll make a promise to choose all of you
And, If you will follow me now
I'll be always there to follow you
So, If you choose always me
I'll make a promise to choose all of you
And, If you will follow me now
I'll be always there to follow you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
