Alabama High-test
Got me in a big mess
Higher than a wildcat
A-runnin' from the wolfpack
They're gonna put me in the slammer
If they catch me with that Alabama
High-test

65, southbound
Cruisin' with a half pound
Blue lights spinnin' round
Better put the hammer down
Dirt road, Tennessee
Ain't nobody stoppin' me
Short run, state line
Gotta keep makin' time
Alabama High-test

A-huff paint, Cocaine
Playin' chicken with a train
Smack dab, Meth lab
Mellow out, rehab
Percocet, Cigarette
I don't need no more of that
Just gimme some down home
Dixie-fried homegrown
Alabama High-test
Alabama High-test
Alabama High-test
Got me in a big mess
Runnin' from the wolfpack
They're gonna put me in the slammer
If they catch me with that Alabama
High-test

Drug bust, disgust
Plead with the circuit judge
"Son, don't be coy
Send you up the river, boy"
Jumpsuit, chain gang
Shackles on my feet and hand
Standin' on I-65
Wishin' I was rolling by
With Alabama High-test

Alabama High-test
Alabama High-test
Got me in a big mess
Higher than a wildcat
They're gonna put me in the slammer
If they catch me with that Alabama
High-test
