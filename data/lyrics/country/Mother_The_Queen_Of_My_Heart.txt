I had a home out in Texas
Down where the bluebonnets grew
I had the kindest old mother
How happy we were just we two
'Til one day the angels called her
That debt we all have to pay
She called me close to her bedside
These last few words to say

Son don't start drinking and gambling
Promise you'll always go straight
Ten years have passed since that parting
That promise I've broke I must say
I started gambling for pastime
At last I was just like them all
I bet my clothes and my money
Not dreaming that I'd ever fall

One night I bet all my money
Nothing was left to be seen
And all that I needed to break them
Was one card and that was a queen
The cards were dealt all round the table
Each man took a card on the draw
I drew the one that would beat them
I turned it and here's what I saw
I saw my mother's picture
And somehow she seemed to say
Son you have broken your promise
So I tossed the cards away
My winnings I gave to a newsboy
I knew I was wrong from the start
And I'll never forget that promise
To my Mother the queen of my heart
Ah-dee-dee-yo-del-lay-ee
Dee-oh-dee-oh-del-lay-ee-dee-oh-del-lay-ee
