I'm gonna steal me a silver stallion
With not a mark upon his silky hide
Teach him he can trust me like a brother
One day we'll saddle up and ride

And we're gonna ride, we're gonna ride
Ride like the one eyed jack of diamonds
With the devil close behind
We're gonna ride

I'm gonna find me a reckless woman
Razor blades and dice in her eyes
Just a touch of sadness in her fingers
Thunder and lightening in her thighs

And we're gonna ride, we're gonna ride
Ride like the one eyed jack of diamonds
With the devil close behind
We're gonna ride

I'm gonna chase the sky forever
With the woman and the stallion and the wind
And the sun is gonna burn into a cinder
Before we ever pass this way again
And we're gonna ride, we're gonna ride
Ride like the one eyed jack of diamonds
With the devil close behind
We're gonna ride
