Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I wanna open my eyes
When the sun breaks through
And see you there, beside me
I wanna reach out at night
And pull you close
I wanna know your arms around me
I wanna dream your dreams
Wanna make em all come true
Dance every dance that you want to
Every breath I breathe will be for you
Well I wanna change your name
I wanna call you mine
I wanna make you smile
At least a million times
I'll give you all my love
Every night and day
If you say I can
I wanna change your name
I wanna find a little church
Where the wild flowers grow
You can hear the wedding bells for miles
Yeah, I wanna see the door swing open
And everybody turn
To see your daddy walk you down the aisle
Yeah, I wanna dream your dreams
Wanna make em all come true
Dance every dance that you want to
Every breath I breathe will be for you
Whoa, I wanna change your name
I wanna call you mine
I wanna make you smile
At least a million times
I'll give you all my love
Every night and day
If you say I can
I wanna change your name
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I'll give you all my love
Every night and day
If you say I can
I wanna change your name
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Yeah
Girl, I wanna see your daddy walk you down the aisle
Wanna wake up to your pretty smile
Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah
I wanna change your name
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
