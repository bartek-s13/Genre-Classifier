I felt my heart stop, Right there in that parking lot
The only call at 2 am, I still don't know what you said
It was so hard to listen
But i know what you meant the whole time
You were saying anything to get closure
Yeah everything but it’s over
Oh how could it be over when it never was
You were never in love
Just in love with the thought of me
Not in love like you ought to be
Just enough to get all you need
I had nothing to give
When you asked for it all back
But you already knew that
Cause there was never an us
And you were never in love
Kept me in the dark
Only looking after your heart
Thought you wanted a new start, I didn't know
That you would go and say it's real just to fake it
Oh it never was what you made it
I guess having all of me wasn’t enough
You were never in love
Just in love with the thought of me
Not in love like you ought to be
Just enough to get all you need
I had nothing to give
When you asked for it all back
But you already knew that
Cause there was never an us
And they say when you know you know
But they never say what to do when he don't
You were never in love
Just in love with the thought of me
Not in love like you ought to be
Just enough to get all you need
I had nothing to give
When you asked for it all back
But you already knew that
Cause there was never an us
And you were never in love
Mmm
