As I travel through this pilgrim land
There is a friend, who walks with me
Leads me safely through the sinking sand
It is the Christ of Calvary
This would be my prayer dear Lord each day
To help me do the best I can
For I need the light to guide me day and night
Blessed Jesus hold my hand

Jesus, hold my hand, I need, thee every hour
Through, this pilgrim land, protect me by Thy power
Hear my feeble plea, O Lord, look down on me
*When I kneel in prayer I hope to meet you there
*Blessed Jesus hold my hand
Instrumental – Follow pattern of last two lines in Chorus*
Let me travel in the light divine
That I may see, the blessed way
Keep me that I may be wholly Thine
And sing redemption's song some day
I will be a soldier brave and true
And ever firmly take a stand
As I onward go and daily meet the foe
Blessed Jesus hold my hand
Repeat Chorus
When I kneel in prayer I hope to meet you there
Blessed Jesus hold my hand
