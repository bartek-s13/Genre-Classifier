An early riser, always on timer
A back breaker, giver not a taker
Made sure nothin' was missin'
So we could have everything you didn’t
A patient teacher, strong steady leader
Firm hand shaker, never met a stranger
Tough as steel, heart of gold
It took a while, but now I know
All the little life lessons
But you never expected

A thank you, a pat on the back
You did what you did, no questions asked
I could never say enough through the downs and the ups
You carried the weight so we’d have a good life
Raised us with love so we could fly
Anyone else would call you Superman
But I just call you dad

A spirit lifter, problem fixer
Words of reason, there when you need em’
Calm you down, set you straight
Yeah, I appreciate
All the little life lessons
But you never expected

A thank you, a pat on the back
You did what you did, no questions asked
I could never say enough through the downs and the ups
You carried the weight so we’d have a good life
Raised us with love so we could fly
Anyone else would call you Superman
But I just call you dad

I just call you when I’m lost, when I’m empty
When I need a little help
Whenever I get good news
You’re the first one I wanna tell

So I wanna thank you, give you a pat on the back
For doin' what you did, no questions asked
I could never say enough through the downs and the ups
You carried the weight so we’d have a good life
Raised us with love so we could fly
Anyone else would call you Superman
And I am the man that I am
Because I call you dad
