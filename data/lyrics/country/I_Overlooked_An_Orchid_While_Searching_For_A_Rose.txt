The orchid is a flower that blooms so tenderly
To thrill the fairest lady of the land
If placed beside a blushing rose the rose cannot compare
But how was such as I to understand
I overlooked an orchid while searching for a rose
The orchid that I overlooked was you
The rose that I was searching for has proved to be untrue
The orchid now I find my dear was you
The rose has lost its color but the orchid is the same
And I'm alone to face these lonely years
I didn't see the orchid I was looking for a rose
And now I pay the price with bitter tears
Cause I overlooked an orchid...
