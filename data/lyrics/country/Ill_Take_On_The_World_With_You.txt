Billy Badass on the school playground
Calling me names and pushin' me around
And his jaw got jacked
I still love you for that
Momma 'bout cried and Daddy so red
When he found them cigarettes under your bed
But I said they were mine
Because you had a date that night

Brother let me hold your trouble when it gets too heavy
Let me fly when you're high
Let me sink like a stone when you're low
Brother let me say a little prayer for you
Take a sucker punch for you
I'll do anything for you
Hey you ain't alone
Yeah I'll take on the world with you
[Verse}
We got the same temper with the same short fuse
Same last name, same battle tattoo
That I talked you into
Man I swear they're still cool
We both tried to act tough when you loaded your truck
To chase that dream
That broke the band up
I said some things
That you know I didn't mean
Brother let me hold your trouble when it gets too heavy
Let me fly when you're high
Let me sink like a stone when you're low
Brother let me say a little prayer for you
Take a sucker punch for you
I'll do anything for you
Hey you ain't alone
Yeah I'll take on the world with you

We ain't got to 
Yeah we got enough proof
From the heavenly highs
And the hell we've been through

Brother let me hold your trouble when it gets too heavy
Let me fly when you're high
Let me sink like a stone when you're low
Brother let me say a little prayer for you
Take a sucker punch for you
I'll do anything for you
Hey you ain't alone
Yeah l'll take on the world with you
I'll take on the world with you
Yeah I'll take on the world with you
