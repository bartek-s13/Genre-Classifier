The seasons come, the seasons go
We get a little sunshine, rain or snow
Just the way that it was planned to be
But there's no seasons in my heart
While you play the leading part
'Cause the flowers will bloom eternally
Your leaving will bring autumn sorrow
And my tears, like withered leaves will fall
But spring could bring some glad tomorrow
And darling, we could be happy after all
As it's all is in nature's plan
No season gets the upper hand
Oh, how I try to keep this fact in mind
The trees are bare, the cold wind blows
And by experience I know
That winter comes but spring is close behind
Your leaving will bring autumn sorrow
And my tears like withered leaves will fall
But spring could bring some glad tomorrow
And darling, we could be happy after all
