Take time out for Jesus He took time for you!
Take a little time in the mornin
And You'll feel better all day
Take a little time for Jesus
To get down on your knees and prey
He took the time to die on the cross
So all the soles couldn't be lost
If you find your self slippin and the pain to do
Take time out for Jesus He took time for you
Sometimes you may be in a hurry
You have so many things to do
So don't forget about jesus
Remember he didn't forget you
He took the time to die on the cross
So all the soles couldn't be lost
If you find your self slippin and the pain to do
Take time out for Jesus He took time for you
Take time out for Jesus He took time for you!
