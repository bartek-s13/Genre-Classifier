I got a half a six pack of Old Milwaukee
And a half a bag of weed
I can't do it like I did when I was a kid
This is all I'm going to need
Because I know you always worry about me drinking my dinner
But I don't do that anymore
I got me a sweet girl at home
She's keeping food on the table
Every night she keeps me warm
So I've got me this piece of paper
And I got my favorite pen
I know it's been a little while
And talking's not my style
So I just had to write my friend

Hey I'm doing alright mamma
I'm ok, I know your late night talks with Jesus
Have helped me on my way
I know it wasn't always easy
Raising my father's son
And your son will be alright
If the shows keep coming
This old guitar and me are still strumming
I know you always knew I always took it way too far
But I'm doing alright now mamma
I'm doing alright now mamma
I'm doing alright now mamma
I'm doing ok
You remember the time I was stuck in L.A.?
And I didn't have a job
And I didn't have a way to pay the bills that I racked up
Yeah, you kept me from losing my truck
Yeah, I'm a little better off now
Than I was then
But it's sure nice to see you calling me when
I'm out there on the road
Yeah, you calling to say "have a good show"
