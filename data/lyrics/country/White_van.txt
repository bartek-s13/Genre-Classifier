When Y'all are clockin' out
We're loadin' in
So come on down bring all your friends
Gonna play you a song
Strong as liquor
Get it stuck in your head
Just like a bumper sticker on a
White van
Me and the boys in a bar band
Pickin' and a kickin'
In the promised land
Just tryin' to make a bunch of new fans
Y'all see that big ol' bus
No that ain't us
But this ol' chevy, she's a catchin' up
With a lotta hard work and a little luck
Someday we'll ride in style
‘Till then we'll be rackin' up miles
Rollin' in a white van
Man it's good to be here tonight
Up on stage, underneath these lights
Dance floor full of girls kickin' up dust
Parkin' lot chock full of pickup trucks
And a white van
Me and the boys in a bar band
Pickin' and a kickin'
In the promised land
Just tryin' to make a bunch of new fans
Y'all see that big ol' bus
No that ain't us
But this ol' chevy, she's a catchin' up
With a lotta hard work and a little luck
Someday we'll ride in style
‘Till then we'll be rackin' up miles
Rollin' in a white van
Man it's good to be here tonight
Up on stage, underneath these lights
Dance floor full of girls kickin' up dust
Parkin' lot chock full of pickup trucks
Yeah, we got the hammer down
We're big time round
Rockin' every country fair
In every little town
And when the night ends
We'll be back on the road again
Rollin' in a white van
Me and the boys in a bar band
Pickin' and a kickin'
In the promised land
Just tryin' to make a bunch of new fans
Y'all see that big ol' bus
No that ain't us
But this ol' chevy, she's a catchin' up
With a lotta hard work and a little luck
Someday we'll ride in style
‘Till then we'll be rackin' up miles
Rollin' in a white van
Yeah, we got the hammer down
In a white van
