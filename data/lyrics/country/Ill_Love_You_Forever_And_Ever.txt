Forever and ever I'll love you
I swear by the stars up above you
There never will be any other
I'll love you forever and ever
The sun may stop shining in heaven
The salty old sea may run dry
The Man in the Moon may stop smiling
Oh, but I'll always be by your side
Forever and ever I'll love you
I swear by the stars up above you
There never will be any other
I'll love you forever and ever
No other arms ever will hold me
No other lips ever will kiss me
No other heart ever will miss me
I'll love you forever and ever
Forever and ever I'll love you
I swear by the stars up above you
There never will be any other
I'll love you forever and ever
I'll love you forever and ever
