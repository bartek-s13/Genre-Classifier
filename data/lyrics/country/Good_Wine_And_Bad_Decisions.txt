It don't matter what dress I put on
We both know it won't stay on for long
And these heels all they're good for
Is walking through your door and laying on your bedroom floor
Good wine and bad decisions
A little lovin' never hurt no one
Good wine and bad decisions
I'll be gone when the morning comes
Ain't hurt nobody, got no one at home
Sometimes a girl just don't like to be alone
Two old flames burning bright, oh it sure feels right
If only for one night
Good wine and bad decisions
A little lovin' never hurt no one
Good wine and bad decisions
I'll be gone when the morning comes
Good wine and bad decisions
A little lovin' never hurt no one
Good wine and bad decisions
I'll be gone when the morning comes
Yeah, I'll be gone when the morning comes
