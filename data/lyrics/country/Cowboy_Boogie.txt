When he swings in the saddle, he's a real gone cat
With his Spanish spurs and his buckaroo hat
Camps in an old line shack way back in the sticks
He loves to tie 'em down and burn their hide
And there ain't no rough string he can't ride
But cuttin' a rug is how he gets his kicks

He does the cowboy boogie
The cowboy way
The cowboy boogie
Come ah ty yah yippy yippy yah yippy yippy yay

So it's adios to his old payoose
And down the road to turn it loose
At an old dance hall he cuts that gal out straight
Spins her sideways through the herd
He's bucking like he's being spurred
Twisting and a rocking like a bronc
Coming outta the gate

He does the cowboy boogie
The cowboy way
The cowboy boogie
Come ah ty yah yippy yippy yah yippy yippy yay

Well he swings in the saddle, he's a real gone cat
With his Spanish spurs and his buckaroo hat
A true ? walking fool, he ain't no dude
The Fred Astaire of hill and range
Two parts cool and one part strange
He's the best out west at any altitude

He does the cowboy boogie
The cowboy way
The cowboy boogie
Come ah ty yah yippy yippy yah yippy yippy yay

He does the cowboy boogie
The cowboy way
The cowboy boogie
Come ah ty yah yippy yippy yah yah yippy
Come ah ty yah yippy yippy yah yah yippy
Come ah ty yah yippy yippy yah yah yippy yippy yay
