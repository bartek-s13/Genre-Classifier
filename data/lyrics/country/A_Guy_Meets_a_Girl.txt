A guy meets a girl
About three whiskeys in on a packed out Friday night
Wasn't looking for love, wasn't looking for nothing
But she had something that he liked
A guy meets a girl
Who kinda likes the way he talks that southern drawl
Those y'all's got her all caught up
In a crazy conversation about Californication, yeah
'Cause the cover band was playing it

And that's how it starts, a couple beers in a bar
Turns into, "Can I get your number?"
Next thing you know you love her
And then
You're sitting right where you never knew you wanted to be
You never saw it coming, now you never want her to leave
Ain't it crazy, that just might maybe
Change the whole world when a guy meets a girl

For a second date, he couldn't hardly wait three days to call
Cleans out his truck, walks up to her doorstep
Thinks "Aw, hell yeah," drops his jaw
They ride around in that small town
She's thinking white gowns
He's thinking about a little house outside them city limits
And them living in it

Yeah, that's how it starts, a couple beers in a bar
Turns into, "Can I get your number?"
Next thing you know you love her
And then
You're sitting right where you never knew you wanted to be
You never saw it coming, now you never want her to leave
Ain't it crazy, that just might maybe
Change the whole world when a guy meets a girl

On down the road a couple years or so
You know how the story goes
Hospital room 209
She's got her mama's eyes and for the very first time
A guy meets a girl
A guy meets a girl

Yeah, that's how it starts, a couple beers in a bar
Turns into, "Can I get your number?"
Next thing you know you love her
And then
You're sitting right where you never knew you wanted to be
You never saw it coming, now you never want her to leave
Ain't it crazy, that just might maybe
Change the whole world when a guy meets a girl, yeah
A guy meets a girl
