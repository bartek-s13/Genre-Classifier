You got a lock on your heart, it's chained in the dark
Somehow you lost the key
You said you tried everything to get love back again
But baby you ain't tried me
Bet I could break on through
If you want me to
Tell me what it takes to put a smile on your face
And leave your lonely days behind
I can take it from there, get you floatin' on air
Girl, if you just give me a sign
That you want me to
Do you want me to?
My heart's skippin' like a stone on the water
Tell me what do I gotta do
To make you want me too
The way I feel, couldn't fall any farther
Help me, what do I gotta do
To make you want me
To make you want me
To make you want me too
Out of all the million things that I might dream for
I can only think of one
And it's me and you sailin' under the blue
Underneath the golden sun
All I want is you
Do you want me too?
My heart's skippin' like a stone on the water
Tell me what do I gotta do
To make you want me too
The way I feel, couldn't fall any farther
Help me, what do I gotta do
To make you want me
To make you want me
To make you want me too
My heart's skippin' like a stone on the water
Tell me what do I gotta do
To make you want me too
The way I feel, couldn't fall any farther
Help me, what do I gotta do
To make you want me
To make you want me
To make you want me too
