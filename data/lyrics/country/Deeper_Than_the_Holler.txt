Well I've heard those city singers singin' 'bout how they can love,
Deeper than the oceans, higher than the stars above.
Well, I come from the country, and I know I ain't seen it all
But I heard that ocean's salty, and the stars, they sometimes fall.
And that would not do justice to the way I feel for you
So I had to sing this song about all the things I knew
My love is deeper than the holler.
Stronger than the river
Higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill
My love is purer than the snowflakes,
That fall in late December
And honest as a Robin on a springtime window sill
And longer than the song of a whippoorwill.
From the back roads to the Broadway shows with a million miles between
There's a least a million love songs that people love to sing
And every one is different, and every one's the same
And this is just another way of sayin' the same thing
My love is deeper than the holler
Stronger than the river
Higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill
My love is purer than the snowflakes
That fall in late December
And honest as a Robin on a spring-time window sill
And longer than the song of a whippoorwill
My love is deeper than the holler
Stronger than the river
Higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill
My love is purer than the snowflakes
That fall in late December
And honest as a Robin on a spring-time window sill
And longer than the song of a whippoorwill
A Whippoorwill
