This bed is lonely now without you
The moonlight just reminds me
Of what we used to do
But I'm good when the sun comes 'round
And I'm good when I'm out of this house

But when I lay down
The room gets spinning 'round and 'round
'Cause I'm thinking 'bout when you were here
Lips kissing my neck
Laying your head down on my chest
Ooh, I'll always remember
The way that your heart beat with mine
Now the left side of the bed
The empty that you left
The memorie's driving me wild
When I lay down, it's driving me wild
When I lay down

It's hard not to let it show sometimes
So I let on like I let you go
Just to save my pride
And I'm good when my phone's face down
And I'm good when I don't see you out
But when I lay down
The room gets spinning 'round and 'round
'Cause I'm thinking 'bout when you were here
Lips kissing my neck
Laying your head down on my chest
Ooh, I'll always remember
The way that your heart beat with mine
Now the left side of the bed
The empty that you left
The memorie's driving me wild
When I lay down
When I lay down (down)

It's your pretty face in that picture frame
Your tank top on that lampshade, on that night stand
And your perfume on my pillowcase
Those fingernails down my spine
Staying up 'til that sunrise came through the blinds

When I lay down
The room gets spinning 'round and 'round
'Cause I'm thinking 'bout when you were here
Lips kissing my neck
Laying your head down on my chest
Ooh, I'll always remember
The way that your heart beat with mine
Now the left side of the bed
The empty that you left
The memorie's driving me wild
When I lay down, it's driving me wild
When I lay down
