Remember when you loved me
Remember when I left
Remember when it hurt like nothing else
Wanna try that again
Remember when we fought together
It was us against the world
Remember how close we came
Wanna try that again, again

We can never go back
We can only go on and on
We can never go back
We can only go on and on and on
Go on and on and on

Remember when it all fell silent
Remember when you raised your voice
Remember what forgiveness feels like
Oooh you wanna try that again
You wanna try that again

We can never go back
We can only go on and on
We can never go back
We can only go on and on and on
We can never go back
We can only go on and on and on
Go on and on and on and on

Remember how it started
We can never go back
We can only go on and on
We can never go back
We can only go on and on
Oh, we can never go back
We can only go on and on
Go on and on and on
Go on and on and on
Go on and on and on

On and on and on and on
We could on and on and on
On and on and on
