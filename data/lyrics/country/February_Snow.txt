Your eyes glowed like candles in the night
As you wiped the freezin' tears from your eyes
I said you still love me, you said I don't know
Left me standing in the February snow
We were the couple others strive to be
Now you're just you and I'm just me
I meant every single word I said
Just not the ones that got us in the end

'Cause I really wish that you'd come back
I just can't do this on my own
'Cause every time I close my eyes
I'm underneath that street light in the cold
As you fade into that February snow

Every night I sleep I dream of you
Guess sometimes some dreams don't come true
I gave up on counting sheep I just stare at the door 'til I fall asleep
And I pray that one day you might come through

'Cause I really wish that you'd come back
I just can't do this on my own
'Cause every time I close my eyes
I'm underneath that street light in the cold
As you fade into that February snow
'Cause I really wish that you'd come back
I just can't do this on my own
'Cause every time I close my eyes
I'm underneath that street light in the cold
As you fade into that February snow
