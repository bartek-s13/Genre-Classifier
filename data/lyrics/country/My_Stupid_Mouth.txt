I think you know the one
She's the one walking round
She's the Center, of attention
You've seen it all before
All she wants is a hype just to throw it away
Everything she says with a smile
Has the boys thinking this could be something
Something special
Then she let's you down she don't care
Cause she knows she can do it again and again
If you knew what I knew
I would steal you away cause we belong together

She's got you wrapped around her finger going crazy
She's got you thinking that she's everything
For every girl like that who gets what she wants
There's a boy like you hanging on forever
Ohhh whoo whooo I can see it right now
She's nothing but a friday night when I could be a lifetime

You call me just to say she's the one
Like a dream and you don't wanna wake up, it's perfect
I've heard it all before
Like a scene on the big screen stuck on repeat
If you could see what I see
If you could then you would know that we belong together
She's got you wrapped around her finger going crazy
She's got you thinking that she's everything
For every girl like that who gets what she wants
There's a boy like you hanging on forever
And any second now you'll take a look and realize
That all you're left with is a goodbye
When it falls apart and everything's a mess
You gonna want my heart to put you back together
Ohhh whoo whooo I can see it right now
She's nothing but a friday night when I could be a lifetime

She's got you wrapped around her finger going crazy
She's got you thinking that she's everything
For every girl like that who gets what she wants
There's a boy like you hanging on forever
And any second now you'll take a look and realize
That all you're left with is a goodbye
When it falls apart and everything's a mess
You gonna want my heart to put you back together
Ohhh whoo whooo I can see it right now
She's nothing but a friday night when I could be a lifetime
I could be a lifetime
I could be a lifetime
Oh she's nothing but a friday night
When I could be a lifetime
