Something goin' on I can feel it in the air
Seein’ dimes in bikinis laying everywhere
Fillin up cups, livin it up, drinking too much
Passin out in a beach chair

Hello summer, can I get your number?
Cuz you're hot as hell, so I might as well, try to make you mine
I’ll be missin' your sunburn, and all the fireworks
And it won't be long and you’ll be gone
I’ll be dialing your number
Hello summer

Glad your girls got you to stay
Cuz I was hopin’ you would walk my way
Took me all day, just to get your name, and there’s something I been tryin' to say

Hello Summer, can I get your number?
Cuz you're hot as hell, so I might as well, try to make you mine
I’ll be missin' your sunburn, and all the fireworks
And it won't be long and you’ll be gone
I’ll be dialing your number
Hello summer

Before I let this moment slip away
It’s a good thing I got the chance to say
Hello Summer
