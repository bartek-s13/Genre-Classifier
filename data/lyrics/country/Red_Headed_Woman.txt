The way she looks at me makes my head spin around*
I'm not quite sure yet just exactly what I've found
The face of an angel and darkness that can make you cry
The wind blows all around us but time just passes by
She's a red headed woman with a cigarette and evil in her eyes
She's a red headed woman with a cigarette that's her clever disguise
Well the whiskey goes down a little smoother than it ever has before
She took one last drag from a cigarette and our clothes hit the floor
Well I bet she imagined another as she spoke with a wicked tongue
All the demons from inside of me something I could not overcome
She's a red headed woman with a cigarette desire in her eyes
She's a red headed woman with a cigarette that's her clever disguise
Well I walked away knowing that I've become something I could not ignore
And she just watched me as I turn around walk right out the devil's door
Pack of cigarettes on the night stand just one more left to smoke
Her red hair stood out in the darkness and the silence took over her soul
She's a red headed woman with a cigarette desire in her eyes
She's a red headed woman with a cigarette thats her clever disguise
She's a red headed woman with a cigarette and evil in her eyes
She's a red headed woman with a cigarette that's her pretty eyed disguise
Awww yeahh ayyy
Well she's a red headed woman with a cigarette
A red headed woman with a cigarette she's a red headed woman...
