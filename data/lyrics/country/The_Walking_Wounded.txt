We're in the church house kneeling down
We're in the subways, underground
We're in the bars and on the street
We drive a truck, we walk a beat
We're in the mills and factories
We make the steel, we cut the trees
A thousand yards stare as a glass
But we will see you when you pass


We lost our homes, we lost our dreams
All our goals have turned to schemes
We hurt each other and ourselves
So after long traumatic spells

We are the walking, we are the walking
We are the walking wounded

We cried out from the deepest pit
But rise back up each time we're hit
We fell from power and from grace
Resurrection's in our face
We're just like little girls and boys
We play with grown up toys
We never thought of sink or swim
My brother hurts me so I hurt him

We are the walking, we are the walking
We are the walking wounded


Like a circle, round and round
We go up so we come down
We don't explain or apologise
We pull the veil across our eyes
We see through your fake refrain
We won't let you see our pain
You may not know us but you'll see
There are more than you'd believe

We are the walking, we are the walking
We are the walking, we are the walking
We are the walking (a thousand hours of glass)
We are the walking (see our past)
We are the walking wounded
