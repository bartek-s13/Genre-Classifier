Yeah, just kids
1987, two door Civic, with a stick shift
Parked next to a rusted out old Chevy
With a lift kit, high school parking lot
Full of hand-me-downs, and daddy's money
If it rolls it rocks, cause its all yours
And ain't it something
Kids with cars, back when who you are
Was all about having a ride on a Friday night
And how many friends you can pack inside
It's just kids with cars, yeah
We're just kids with cars
Showing off those brand new custom plates
On that drop top, Cavalier
With the seats back all the way
She's so hot
Just enough money for gas
And bottle of Coke
Found on the dash
Making out, limo tint
Cruise the strip
Do it again
Just
Kids with cars, back when who you are
Was all about having a ride on a Friday night
Your first real kiss in the dashboard light
Just kids with cars, yeah
We're just kids with cars
That wood panel wagon that you got for free
Didn't have no heat, didn't have AC
But it's got cruise control, and two back seats
And a 12-inch sub that'll rattle your teeth
And that old Ford Bronco dent in the door
Jack belt mud tires, hole in the floor
With the brand new Mustang
Pedal down running
Burning rubber at the stop light
Jet black stunning
Kids with cars, back when who you are
Was all about having a ride on a Friday night
And how many friends you can pack inside
It's just kids with cars, yeah
Yeah, we're just kids with cars
Yeah, just kids
