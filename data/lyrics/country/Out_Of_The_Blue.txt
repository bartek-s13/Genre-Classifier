Man, I needed this
Check another one off the bucket list trip
Shake off the time clock crazy
Take it slow, layin' low
Blow a little smoke
Hazy, gettin' all steel drum lazy

Sand on the bottom of my beer can
Yeah, the only plan, was to have no plan at all
That all changed when she came into view
She got that needle skippin' out of the groove

Out of the blue
Like the blue jeans she slipped out of under the palm trees
I got a blue bottle of blue chair rum
Kickin' back catchin' a beach front buzz
While I'm watchin' her splashin' in the bright blue water
Like a burning blue flame couldn't get any hotter
Oh, what her blue eyes are makin' me wanna do
Tonight under that blue moon
And the best things come out of the blue

Yeah I could get used to this
No way in hell that I would ever miss, the land locked life for a minute
I mean just look at her, no doubt at all it would all be worth the cost of a one way ticket

Sand on the bottom of my beer can
Yeah, the only plan, was to have no plan at all
That all changed when she came into view
She got that needle skippin' out of the groove

Out of the blue
Like the blue jeans she slipped out of under the palm trees
I got a blue bottle of blue chair rum
Kickin' back catchin' a beach front buzz
While I'm watchin' her splashin' in the bright blue water
Like a burning blue flame couldn't get any hotter
Oh, what her blue eyes are makin' me wanna do
Tonight under that blue moon
And the best things come out of the blue

Out of the blue
Like the blue jeans she slipped out of under the palm trees
I got a blue bottle of blue chair rum
Kickin' back catchin' a beach front buzz
While I'm watchin' her splashin' in the bright blue water
Like a burning blue flame couldn't get any hotter
Oh, what her blue eyes are makin' me wanna do
Tonight under that blue moon
And the best things come out of the blue

Man the best things
Yeah, the best things come out of the blue
Yeah they do
