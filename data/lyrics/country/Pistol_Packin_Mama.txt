Drinking beer in a cabaret and was I having fun
Until one night she caught me right and now I'm on the run

Lay that pistol down, babe - lay that pistol down
Pistol Packin' Mama, lay that pistol down

She kicked out my windshield -  she hit me over the head
She cussed and cried and said I'd lied and wished that I was dead


Drinking beer in a cabaret and dancin' with a blond
Until one night she shot out the light - Bang! that blond was gone


I'll see you ev'ry night, babe - I'll woo you ev'ry day
I'll be your regular daddy - if you'll put that gun away




Now there was old Al Dexter - he always had his fun
But with some lead, she shot him dead - his honkin' days are done
