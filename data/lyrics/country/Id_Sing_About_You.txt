If I was a Beatle I'd sing about yesterday
If I was James Taylor I'd sing about fire and rain
If I was Elvis I'd sing about my shoes
But since I'm just me, I'd sing about you

If I was Hank Williams it'd be about heartache and pain
If I was Tom Petty I'd sing about Mary Jane
If I was Ole Willie I'd sing about eyes that are blue
But since I'm just me, I'd sing about you

'Cause you are the perfect melody
You are every note I'd sing
Every word I'd write
Even when I'm out of tune
All I can be is me
And sing about you

If I was Jimmy Buffett I'd sing about swimmin'
If I was a Stone it'd be about honky tonk women
If I was Ole Blue Eyes I'd sing fly me to the moon
But since I'm just me, I'd sing about you
'Cause you are the perfect melody
And you are every note I'd sing
Every word I'd write
Even when I'm out of tune
All I can be is me
And sing about you

Layla, Amanda, Maggie May, and June
The only thing missin' is

You are the perfect melody
And you are every note I'd sing
Every word I'd write
Even when I'm out of tune
All I can be is me
And I'd sing about you

All I care to be is me
Singin' 'bout you
You know I'd sing about you
