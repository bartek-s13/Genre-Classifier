If I had to guess, I'd say she ain't home
And any tears she had for me are all long gone
No doubt her closet floor is under a pile of clothes
By now, she's tried on everything she owns

She ain't moved on yet
Man she's starting to
I'm just saying if I know her like I think I do

I bet those tight blue jeans are on a new bench seat
I bet that red lipstick is painted on her lips
I wouldn't be surprised if she's somewhere tonight
In those high heeled shoes dancing with new boots

I'm sure some cover band is wearing out her song
I bet that drink in her hand ain't gonna last that long
Whoever she's there with is spinning her around
She's probably a hot mess, making a mess of me right now

I bet those tight blue jeans are on a new bench seat
I bet that red lipstick is painted on her lips
I wouldn't be surprised if she's somewhere tonight
In those high heeled shoes dancing with new boots

Yeah I don't know what she's doing now
But if I had to bet, id throw my money down
On those high heeled shoes dancing with someone new

I bet those tight blue jeans are on a new bench seat
I bet that red lipstick is painted on her lips
I wouldn't be surprised if she's somewhere tonight
In those high heeled shoes dancing with new boots
Dancing with new boots
Dancing with some new boots
