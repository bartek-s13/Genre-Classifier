I walked out tonight on the woman I love
We got in a fight and I said I've had enough
I slammed the door and I headed
For a place I used to go
For a taste of freedom with some
Friends I used to know
They had the jukebox rockin
The music turned up loud
I thought I'd fit right back with my old
Party crowd
Now I can't remember what
I came to find
I've been here all night with
Just one question on my mind
Are you having fun yet
Right now it's hard to tell
My head don't feel that good
This heartache hurts like hell
I think I might'a made a big mistake
If this is good as the good times get
I'm down to my last dime
It's closing time
Are we having fun yet
I'll be she's watching tv now
In my favorite chair
While I ride this barstool
Wishing I was there
In my wildest dreams
This ain't how it's supposed to end
Sitting here and missing her and
Asking my old friends
Are you having fun yet
Right now it's hard to tell
My head don't feel that good
This heartache hurts like hell
I think I might'a made a big mistake
If this is good as the good times get
I'm down to my last dime
It's closing time
Are we having fun yet
