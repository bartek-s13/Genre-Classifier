We all wanna live out in the country
Way back off an ol’ gravel road
Pick a little spot where they can’t find us
No address no zip code
I see oak trees growing in an ol’ fence row
Barbed wire nailed to a cedar fence post
Gotta little bobber dancin’ in a creek
And you sittin’ right there next to me
Long tan legs sun shinin’ on ‘em
I know it’s a dream baby I want
Sittin’ there sippin’ on homemade wine
Girl I can’t get it outta my mind
We all wanna live out in the country
Way back off an ol’ gravel road
Pick a little spot where they can’t find us
No address no zip code
We all wanna live out in the country
Way back off an ol’ gravel road
Pick a little spot where they can’t find us
No address no zip code
Gotta make a livin’ anyway you can
You’re just the kinda girl for a simple kinda man
My boss even told me yeah go ahead son
I can understand where you’re comin’ from
We all wanna live out in the country
Way back off an ol’ gravel road
Pick a little spot where they can’t find us
No address no zip code
We all wanna live out in the country
Way back off an ol’ gravel road
Pick a little spot where they can’t find us
No address no zip code
We all wanna live out in the country
Way back off an ol’ gravel road
Pick a little spot where they can’t find us
No address no zip code
Yeah we got no zip code
