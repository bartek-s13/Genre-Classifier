I'm growing tired of the big city lights
Tired of the glamor and tired of the sights
In all my dreams I am roaming once more
Back to my home on that old river shore

I am sad and weary far away from home
Miss the Mississippi and you, dear
Days are dark and dreary and everywhere I roam
Miss the Mississippi and you

Roaming the wide world over
Always alone and blue, so blue
Nothing seems to cheer me under heaven's dome
Miss the Mississippi and you
Oh-del-lay-ee-oh-del-lay-ee
Dee-oh-lay-ee-oh-del-lay-ee
Oh-del-lay-ee-oh-del-lay-ee-oh-del-ee-del-lay-ee

Memories are bringing happy days of your
Miss the Mississippi and you
Mockingbirds are singing 'round the cabin door
Miss the Mississippi and you

Roaming the wide world over
Always alone and blue, so blue
Longing for my homeland, muddy water shore
Miss the Mississippi and you
Oh-del-lay-ee-oh-del-lay-ee
Dee-oh-lay-ee-oh-del-lay-ee
Mississippi and you
