Nobody writes goodbye notes
And takes off to God-only-knows on trains anymore
And to tell you the truth
I don't really see much use in walking the floor

Old songs make it sound so cool
To be a half-drunk heartbroke fool
When that fool is you, it's not

And the only way this heartache
Is like an old Hank Williams song
Is the lonely, the lonesome, and the gone

There's a place down by the mall
But it ain't what you'd call a honky tonk
They got a new jukebox
Filled up with country rock
'Cause that's what folks want

I don't know why no one sings about
Drowning in pitchers and half-priced wings
And trying to wish back everything they lost

Yeah the only way this heartache
Is like an old Hank Williams song
Is the lonely, the lonesome, and the gone

He never sang about watching a Camry pulling out
Of a crowded apartment parking lot

But I guess in some ways every heartache
Is like an old Hank Williams song
There's the lonely, the lonesome, and the gone
There's the lonely, the lonesome, and the gone
