Hey, this is God
Could I please have your attention
There's a need for intervention
Man, I'm disappointed in what I'm seeing
Yeah, this is God
You fight each other in my name
Treat life like it's a foolish game
I'd say you've got the wrong idea
Oh, all I'm asking for is love
Well, I've seen you hurt yourselves enough
Oh, I've been waiting on a change in you
Yeah, this is God
I've given everything to you
But look at what you do
To the world that I created
This is God
And what's with this attitude and hate
You grow more ignorant with age
You had it made, now look at all you've wasted
Oh, all I'm asking for is love
I've seen you hurt yourselves enough
Oh, I've been waiting on a change in you, yeah
I know your every thought
Your heart and soul and every move
There are so many consequences
To the things you do
All I'm asking for is love
Haven't you hurt yourselves enough
Oh, I've been waiting on a change in you
A change in you, oh
This is God
