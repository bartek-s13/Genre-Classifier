She said, "I guess there ain't no right way
For you to say goodbye again
You been looking at the highway
Where your heart has always been
I could cuss you from here to Tuscon
But there ain't nothing left to say, boy"
She said, "I thought that I could change you
Naw, but you were born a playboy"

So get on the stage and play boys
Let's kick out the lights tonight, get high, and make noise
We might drink a little too much whiskey
We might have a little too much fun
She's already gone away boys
If we don't go home, what difference does it make, boys?
This ol' world would be a dull place boys
If it was all work and no play boys

A hundred miles outside of Houston
Third name on the marquee sign
But out here you get used to losing
Your friends, your lovers, and your mind
So get on the stage and play boys
Let's kick out the lights tonight, get high, and make noise
Yeah, let's drink a little too much whiskey
Yeah, let's have a little too much fun
She's already gone away boys
If we don't go home, what difference does it make, boys?
This ol' world would be a dull place boys
If it was all work and no play boys
(Play, boys)

Set 'em up, we'll knock 'em down
Wake up in another town
We don't know no other way
We ain't good at love
We ain't good at much
We just know how to play, hey, hey

I'm just a playboy
You can't blame me for the way that I was made boys
Yeah, I might drink a little too much whiskey
Yeah, I might have a little too much fun
She's already gone away boys
If we don't go home, what difference does it make boys?
This ol' world would be a dull place boys
If it was all work and no play boys
