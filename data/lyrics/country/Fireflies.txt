Rolled a blanket down by the water
It's just you and me tonight
I can't fight us getting sleepy
The whole world is going quiet
Even lights fading away
Gentle breeze is blowing past
Making the grass slowly dance
Wish this night wouldn't go so fast

Watching fireflies in west Texas
Sittin' under the Cypress tree
See the moon rise over the river
No place I'd rather be

Can't stop life from racing by
There's magic in the air tonight
I remember every moment
For the rest of my life

Watching fireflies in west Texas
Sittin' under the Cypress tree
See the moon rise over the river
No place I'd rather be

And I might see a shooting star
But I won't wish on them anymore
And just you saying that you love me
Is all I can ask for

Watching fireflies in west Texas
Sittin' under the Cypress trees
See the moon rise over the river
No place I'd rather be
You and me and the fireflies
Flying under the Cypress trees
See the sun rise over the river
No place I'd rather be
See the sun rise over the river
No place I'd rather be
