Dim lights, thick smoke?
When I noticed you in here tonight girl I just about choked
?I’ve been planning on making you mine but I didn’t want to move too fast
One glance at the dance floor and I could see my chance had passed
Look at you laughin’, leanin’ into him
?With his arms wrapped around you where mine shoulda been
Pretty as a picture and so in love
?If I’d have moved quicker well it could have been us
?Look at you floatin’ ten feet off the ground?
And lookin’ up at him like there’s no one else around
Whoever said good things come to those who wait
?Never lost a girl like you by lovin’ just a little too late
I’d cause a scene, try cuttin’ in
?But I can tell I wouldn’t stand a chance in Hell by the way you just kissed him
So I’ll swallow this whiskey and the words I didn’t get to say
?Got a front row ticket tonight to watch the one that got away
Look at you laughin’, leanin’ into him
?With his arms wrapped around you where mine shoulda been
Pretty as a picture and so in love
?If I’d have moved quicker well it could have been us?
Look at you floatin’ ten feet off the ground
?And lookin’ up at him like there’s no one else around
Whoever said good things come to those who wait?
Never lost a girl like you by lovin’ just a little too late
It’s like a train wreck goin’ up in flames
I can’t seem to turn away
Look at you laughin’, leanin’ into him?
With his arms wrapped around you where mine shoulda been
Pretty as a picture, so in love
?I’m kickin’ myself ‘cause it could have been us
?Look at you floatin’ ten feet off the floor
?Well it’s makin’ me want you like I never did before?
Whoever said good things come to those who wait?
Never lost a girl like you by lovin’ just a little too late
?Just a little too late, little too late, little too late
