Rainy nights, candles burning
I'm tossing, turning, my heart is hurting
Waking up bright and early
I grab my things, I'm gon' be late
So I jumped in my four-by-four
Then I left mud trails on the road
'Cause I gotta get home

I'm in my mood
Tell me, what can I say? You’re a glass of champagne
And I’m just Tennessee whiskey
Mood
Tell me, what am I to do when it's all about you?
But I’m on this Tennessee whiskey
Yay, yay, yay-yay
Yay-yay-yay-yay
Yay-yay-yay
Girl, I'm on this Tennessee whiskey

I can't remember the last time
We had a one-on-one under the moonlight
My heart can't take no more of the little bitty lies
Deep down I had to swallow my pride
So I jumped back in my four-by-four
Then I left burnt rubber on the road, yeah
I'm in my mood
Tell me, what can I say? You're a glass of champagne
And I'm just Tennessee whiskey
Mood
Tell me, what can I do? It was all about you
But I'm on this Tennessee whiskey
Mood
Tell me how can I change? You're a glass champagne
But I'm just Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey, Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey
Yay, yay, yay-yay
Yay-yay-yay-yay
Yay-yay-yay
Tennessee whiskey
