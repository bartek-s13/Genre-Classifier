I can't stop loving you so I've made up my mind
To live in memories of old lonesome times
I can't stop wanting you it's useless to say
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterday
Those happy hours that we once knew though long ago still make me blue
They say that time heels the broken heart
But time is stood still since we've been apart
I can't stop loving you...
