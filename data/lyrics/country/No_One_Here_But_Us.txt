Show me you, I'll show you me
And turn me loose, I'll set you free
It's 4 o'clock in the morning
Nothing under the skin we were born in, and that's ok
No one here but us
And girl it's taking a long long time
But you damn sure worth the wait
Butterflies and lives to live
As I feel you by my side
There ain't no one here but us

And the way I want you, always want you
Till the credits roll and the good year show
True love should last forever
Until you pull your anchor here
When it's only you and me
Here for all the world to see
There ain't no one here but us

Promise you, you promise me
(Promise you, you promise me)
And give me your faith and you will see
I will be your shadow, follow you anywhere you go baby
That's ok
Ain't no one here but us

And when they lay us down to rest
And throw those flowers on our chest
There’ll be no one here but us
