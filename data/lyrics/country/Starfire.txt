It's like I'm walking on a high wire, staring straight into the sun
With the universe around me waiting for me to fall down
Your love is like a junkie, juggling a loaded gun
Your words are like a whiskey river rolling off of your tongue

But you won't burn out this starfire
There’s fearless dancing in my flames
Blow me out, I'll just burn brighter
Oh, you can't burn out this starfire
No matter what you say

I won't ever be perfection, ever be your golden child
I'm not spinning on this planet just to merely make you smile
I love my crooked halo, hell, I won't apologize
You can touch it all you want, but no matter how hard you try

You won't burn out this starfire
There’s fearless dancing in my flames
Blow me out, I'll just burn brighter
No, you can't burn out this starfire
No matter what you say
Oh you ain't ever, ever gonna burn me out
You ain't ever, ever gonna burn me out
You ain't ever, ever gonna burn me out
You ain't ever, ever gonna burn me out
Oh you can try, but you ain't ever
You ain't ever, oh nah, nah, nah
You ain't ever, ever gonna burn me out
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh

You won't burn out this starfire
There’s fearless dancing in my flames
Blow me out, I'll just burn brighter
No, you can't burn out this starfire
No matter what you say
Yeah, yeah, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh

You ain't ever, ever gonna burn me out
You ain't ever, ever gonna burn me out
You ain't ever, ever gonna burn me out
You ain't ever, ever gonna burn me out
