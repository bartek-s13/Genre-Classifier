Well how was I to know, that the dust in my soul
Was there for a reason, the reason won't show
It could be rust, it might be gold
It's out of my hands, on with the show
The prize that already bears my name
Just gotta get there first, before it gets claimed
And I'll call on you when I find the time
And I promise I'll wave, wave goodbye
High above the water never think twice
Must have been a long way down
And I'll catch you when the next sunrise comes back around
Yeah I should have told you I was stuck in my ways
Must have passed the white flags by
But I'm high above the water now, look at me fly
I'm looking at the devil, standing in the roses
Staring right at me, where you want to go, son
Take what you need but don't wear yourself down
If you stir up trouble, you know I'll be around
But you better not call when the money's not right
In the free of the fall, no one to kiss goodnight
Take a look around, make yourself at home
Just take a deep breath, it will be just fine

High above the water never think twice
Must have been a long way down
And I'll catch you when the next sunrise comes back around
I guess I should have told you I was stuck in my ways
Must have passed the white flags by
But I'm high above the water now, look at me fly
2x
Yeah, just look at me fly
