Just look at you, girl
Standin' here beside me
Starlight on your hair
Lookin' like a dream I dreamed somewhere
And look at me, girl
You got me actin' just like a lover
In an old time picture show
And how I got the part -- I just don't know
But it's written all across your face
Plain as it can be
You're the one that I was lookin' for
Now you're all that I can see

You mean everything to me
And I'd do anything to have you stay forever
I'm an ordinary man
But I feel like I could do anything in the world
When I look at you, girl

Just look at you, girl
Walkin' here beside me
Misty morning light
I see my own reflection in your eyes
And you smile at me, girl
With eyes that tell a story
That words can never say, tellin' me your love is gonna stay
And we're standin' right together now
In everything we do
And if my world should come apart
I'll still be lovin' you
'Cause you mean everything to me
And I'd do anything to have you stay forever
I'm an ordinary man
But I feel like I could do anything in the world
When I look at you, girl
