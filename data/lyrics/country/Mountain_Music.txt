You see that mountain over there? Yeah?
Well, one of these days I'm going to climb that mountain

Oh, play me some mountain music
Like grandma and grandpa used to play
Then I'll float on down the river
To a Cajun hideaway

Drift away like Tom Sawyer, ride a raft with old Huck Finn
Take a nap like Rip Van Winkle, daze dreaming again

Oh, play me some mountain music
Like grandma and grandpa used to play
Then I'll float on down the river
To a Cajun hideaway

Swim across the river, just to prove that I'm a man
Spend the day being lazy, just being nature's friend
Climb a long tall hickory. Bend it over, skinning cats
Playing baseball with chert rocks, using sawmill slabs for bats

Play some back-home, come-on music
That comes from the heart
Play something with lots of feeling
Because that's where music has to start

Oh, play me some mountain music
Like grandma and grandpa used to play
Then I'll float on down the river
To a Cajun hideaway

Oh play me mountain music
Oh play me mountain music
Oh play me mountain music
Oh play me mountain music
