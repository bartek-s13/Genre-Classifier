(Promise me that you will never be nobody's darlin' but mine)
Come sit by my side little darlin' come lay your cool hand on my brow
And promise me that you will never be nobody's darlin' but mine
Be nobody's darlin' but mine love be honest be faithful be kind
And promise me that you will never be nobody's darlin' but mine
You're as sweet as the flowers of springtime
You're as pure as the dew from the rose
I had rather be somebody's darlin'
Than a poor boy that nobody knows
Be nobody's darlin' but mine love...
