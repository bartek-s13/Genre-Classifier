Lately I've been runnin' into our old friends
Somewhere in the small talk
Someone always asks where you've been
So I tell 'em what you told me
And they can't believe we're through
They ask me what I'm doing now
And in case you're wondering too
I breathe in, I breathe out
Put one foot in front of the other
Take one day at a time
Until you find I'm that someone you can't live without
But until then, I'll breathe in, and breathe out
Now I've got every reason
To find someone new
Cause you swore up and down to me
That I've seen the last of you
But the way that you loved me
Left me hopin' and holdin' on
So until this world stops turnin' round
And my heart believes that you're gone
I'll breathe in and breathe out
Put one foot in front of the other
Take one day at a time
Til you find I'm that someone you can't live without
But until then, I'll breathe in, and breathe out
Yes we were meant to be
Girl there's no doubt
And if it takes the rest of my life
For you to figure it out
I'll breathe in and breathe out
Put one foot in front of the other
Take one day at a time
Until you find I'm that someone you can't live without
But until then, Oh, I'll breathe in, and breathe out
