Stupid Cupid you're a real mean guy
I'd like to cilp your wings, so you can't fly
I'm in love and it's a crying shame
And I know that you're the one to blame
Hey-hey, set me free
Stupid Cupid, stop pickin' on me
I can't do my homework and I can't see straight
I meet him every morning 'bout a half past eight
I'm acting like a lovesick fool
You even got me carrying his books to school
Hey-hey, set me free
Stupid Cupid, stop pickin' on me
You mixed me up but good, right from the very start
Hey, don't play Robin Hood with somebody else's heart
You got me jumpin' like a crazy clown
And I don't feature what you're puttin' down
Since I kissed his lovin' lips of wine
The thing that bothers me is that I like it fine
Hey-hey, set me free
Stupid Cupid, stop pickin' on me
You mixed me up but good, right from the very start
Hey, don't play Robin Hood with somebody else's heart
You got me jumpin' like a crazy clown
And I don't feature what you're puttin' down
Since I kissed his lovin' lips of wine
The thing that bothers me is that I like it fine
Hey-hey, set me free
Stupid Cupid, stop pickin' on me
