Never seem to be alone, and
Can't find a steppin' stone, and
This went better when I played it in my mind
And there's a silence in the air
Don't you know how much I care?
Don't you know that your the reason that I dream?
She said

I've been waitin' on you to kiss me
Waitin' on you to make your move
There's a window open to steal my heart
And I'm waitin' on you to kiss me

It's all these little games, and
I hope you feel the same, and
I live my life afraid you'll never know the truth
She said, "don't walk away
I need you to stay
If you want, you can wrap me in your arms."
She said

I've been waitin' on you to kiss me
Waitin' on you to make your move
There's a window open to steal my heart
And I'm waitin' on you to kiss me

Waitin' on you
Waitin' on you
Waitin' on you to kiss me
Waitin' on you
Waitin' on you
Waitin' on you to kiss me

I've been waitin' on you to kiss me
Waitin' on you to make your move
There's a window open to steal my heart
And I'm waitin' on you to kiss me
I've been waitin' on you to kiss me
Waitin' on you to make your move
There's a window open to steal my heart
And I'm waitin' on you to kiss me

Waitin' on you
Waitin' on you
Waitin' on you to kiss me
Waitin' on you
Waitin' on you
Waitin' on you to kiss me
