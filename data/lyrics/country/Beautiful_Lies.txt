Surrounded by pieces of vows that were broken
Leaving me speechless
It's like I don't know him
Everything we built is fallin' down

Tell me I'm making this up
That this ain't for real
Take me back to the night I could feel
Like I was enough when love was just blind
I'm not ready for the truth to see the light
Make it up, make it pretty, I don't mind
Tell me beautiful l lies
Oh yeah

How did this happen?
I thought we were perfect
Never imagined, feeling so worthless
I know I need to face it, but I can't right now

Tell me I'm making this up
That this ain't for real
Take me back to the night I could feel
Like I was enough when love was just blind
I'm not ready for the truth to see the lie
Make it up, make it pretty, I don't mind
Oh yeah
Go on and Tell me those beautiful lies
Tell me I'm making this up
That this ain't for real
Take me back to the night I could feel
Like I was enough when love was just blind
I'm not ready for the truth to see the lie
Make it up, make it pretty, I don't mind
Dream it up, make it real one more time
Make it up, make it pretty, I don't mind
Oh yeah
Please Tell me those beautiful lies

Beautiful lies
Beautiful lies
