You're at the bar you're, takin a sip
Preppin' that top shelf kiss
You're with your girls you're, makin' your rounds
Then the lights start comin' down
The band starts playin', you start swayin'
He asks you to stay and you just wanna get away
It's half past 10 you're a few drinks in
You're cravin' somethin' and it ain't him

When the whiskey gets to you
You get to me, it ain't hard to see
What's goin' on, you pour it on strong
Keepin' it comin' all night long
You push me away then you pull me in closer
Tangled in the dark like Maker's you leave your mark
You try to fight it, try to deny it
But there ain't no lyin' when the proof is on your lips
(Yeah when the proof is on your lips)

Act like its nothin', then you're at my door
Somehow your dress found my floor
Like the last time, swear it's the last round
Next thing you know we're closin' it down
When the whiskey gets to you
You get to me, it ain't hard to see
What's goin' on, you pour it on strong
Keepin' it comin' all night long
You push me away then you pull me in closer
Tangled in the dark like Maker's you leave your mark
You try to fight it, try to deny it
But there ain't no lyin' when the proof is on your lips
(Yeah when the proof is on your lips)

You never call me when you're sober
But just a buzz and you're comin' over

When the whiskey gets to you
You get to me, it ain't hard to see
What's goin' on, you pour it on strong
Keepin' it comin' all night long
You push me away then you pull me in closer
Tangled in the dark like Maker's you leave your mark
You try to fight it, try to deny it
But there ain't no lyin' when the proof is on your lips
(Yeah when the proof is on your lips)
(Yeah when the proof is on your lips)
(Yeah when the proof is on your lips)
