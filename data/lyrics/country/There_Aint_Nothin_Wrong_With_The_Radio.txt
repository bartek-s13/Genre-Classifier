Sometimes she runs, sometimes she don't
More than once, she's left me on the side of the road
The older she gets, the slower we go
But there ain't nothin' wrong with the radio
She needs a carburetor, a set of plug wires
She's riding me around on four bald tires
The wipers don't work and the horn don't blow
But there ain't nothin' wrong with the radio

I got sixteen speakers crossin' my back dash
A little bobbin' dog watchin' everybody pass
Dual antennas whippin' in the wind
Lord, there ain't no country station that I can't tune in
Well, she ain't a Cadillac and she ain't a Rolls
But there ain't nothin' wrong with the radio

I got stopped by a cop late last night
Out of date tags and no taillights
He said, "I oughta run you in but I'm lettin' you go
Because there ain't nothin' wrong with your radio
Got the best looking gal in my hometown
I asked her last time that I took her out
"Honey, tell me what it is that makes you love me so"
She said, "There ain't nothin' wrong with your radio"
I got sixteen speakers crossin' my back dash
A little bobbin' dog watchin' everybody pass
Dual antennas whippin' in the wind
Lord, there ain't no country station that I can't tune in
Well, she ain't a Cadillac and she ain't a Rolls
But there ain't nothin' wrong with the radio

No, she ain't a Cadillac and she ain't a Rolls
But there ain't nothin' wrong with the radio
