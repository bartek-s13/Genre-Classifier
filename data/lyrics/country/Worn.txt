The path between a center and a church
Hands from an honest day’s work
A heart from a world of hurt
Worn
Marks on a wooden floor
Steps to an open door
The fabric we fight for
Worn
So thin you almost see straight through it
So precious even when it’s torn
I find the finer things worth keeping
Are worn
The color of a photograph
Words from an epitaph
The hope that you once had
Worn
The lines on your mother’s face
The Bible that your daddy saved
You carried it to his grave
Worn
So thin you almost see straight through it
So precious even when it’s torn
I find the finer things worth keeping
Are worn
So thin you almost see straight through it
So precious even when it’s torn
I find the finer things worth keeping
Are worn
The house where it all began
Finish of a wedding band
You and I together we stand
Worn
