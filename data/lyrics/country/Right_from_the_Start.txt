The first time that I met you I was sure as sure it could be
Don't ask me how but there was no doubt you were the one for me
Love was intuition is a feeling you just can't fight
So I follow through with my plans for you
And now I know that I was right
Right from the start I had this feeling in my heart
Baby I knew you were right for the part
Right from the start
Don't you remember me saying our love was sure to grow
Well that's just what it did and you've got to admit
Baby I told you so
Right from the start I had this feeling in my heart
Baby I knew you were right for the part
Right from the start
I guess I shouldn't say anything
I've never been right before
But there's a first time for everything
And this time my heart was sure
Oh right from the start I had this feeling in my heart
Baby I knew you were right for the part
Right from the start I had this feeling in my heart
Baby I knew you were right for the part
