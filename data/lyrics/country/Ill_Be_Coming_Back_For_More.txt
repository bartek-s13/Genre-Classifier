I've had girls and I've had women
You weren't the first
You probably won't be the last
But lady, after last night's lovin'
I'll bet my soul, you're the best
You put your lips where they belong
You brought the love for my secret dreams
I've been held but never touched
You touch me now, I'll never be the same
Baby, I'll be coming back for more
Some night you'll find me at your door
You know just what a body's for
Now other loves just leave me bored
Last night you took away my breath
And babe, I still ain't found it yet
So you can know one thing's for sure
I'll be coming back for more
I know people stand between us
Someone loves me, someone loves you
But baby, now I've tasted heaven
There's nothin' else that I can do
Baby, I'll be coming back for more
Some night you'll find me at your door
You know just what a body's for
Now other loves just leave me bored
Last night you took away my breath
And babe, I ain't found it yet
So you can know one thing's for sure
I'll be coming back for more
Baby, I'll be coming back for more
Some night you'll find me at your door
You know just what a body's for
Now other loves just leave me bored
Last night you took away my breath
