Black coffee from a Texaco
A lotto ticket 'cause you never know
Another up-all-night, moving slow
It's 11am but I'm good to go

Black leather buckets, yeah the seats get hot
Window down, wind just coolin' it off
No it ain't the red light making me stop
It's four ones on a dashboard clock

It's 11:11 and I can't help make a wish
I wish you wouldn't have left
No, not the way that you did
Why the hell did I say things that I didn't mean
Why didn't I say you were everything, everything
11:11, I hope it's there on your phone
I hope you're thinking of me
And you hate being alone, like I do
I hope you miss me like I miss you
It's 11:11

It's 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Then it's 2-for-1s with the guys
The sun sets and the white stars start to rise
It's gonna be a good, good night
Then it's 10 o'clock and we all pay
We all go our own separate ways
I turn the key, a little bit dazed
But right there on the microwave

It's 11:11 and I can't help make a wish
I wish you wouldn't have left
No, not the way that you did
Why the hell did I say things that I didn't mean
Why didn't I say you were everything, everything
11:11, I hope it's there on your phone
I hope you're thinking of me
And you hate being alone, like I do
I hope you miss me like I miss you
It's 11:11
It's 11:11
Yeah it's 11:11

It's 11:11 and I can't help make a wish
I wish you wouldn't have left
No, not the way that you did

It's 11:11 and I can't help make a wish
I wish you wouldn't have left, not the way that you did
Why the hell did I say things that I didn't mean
Why didn't I say you were everything, everything
11:11, I hope it's there on your phone
I hope you're thinking of me
And you hate being alone like I do
I hope you miss me like I miss you
It's 11:11

Yeah it's 11:11
Oh it's 11:11
Yeah and I miss you
