The first time we did it I was scared to death
She snuck out in that cotton dress
Jumped on in and we drove to the lake
Put her hand on my knee and said I can't wait
I had everything we needed in the bed of my truck
Turns out my baby loves to...

Fish, she wants to do it all the time
Early in the morning, in the middle of the night
She's hooked and now she can't get enough
Man, that girl sure loves to fish
After that that's all she wanted to do
But that was okay cause I did too
She always wants to go down by the dam
And I love how she looks with that rod in her hand
If they ain't bitin' she don't give up
Turns out my baby loves to...

Fish, she wants to do it all the time
Early in the morning, in the middle of the night
She's hooked and now she can't get enough
Man, that girl sure loves to fish
I love to see her silhouette reflectin' off the water
With her hooks and her sinkers and her pretty pink bobbers
The first time I saw her I knew I was in love
Cause I found a girl who loves to...
Fish, I love to see her lyin'
There on the bank neath the full moon light
Man, I can't even believe my luck
I found a girl who loves to...

Fish, she wants to do it all the time
Early in the morning, in the middle of the night
She's hooked and now she can't get enough
Man, that girl sure loves to fish
Yeah, I know she loves to fish
Psst, you awake, let's go fish
