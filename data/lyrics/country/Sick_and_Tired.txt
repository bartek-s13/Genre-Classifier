Got your bag on your shoulder
Never thought once about thinkin' it over
Feel like you're the only one
Who's ever been in a bad situation
Now you need to take yourself a love vacation
'Cause after all, what's done is done
Sick and tired of being sick and tired
Everything around you's growin' old
The days drag on, the nights last forever
Every day's tougher just to keep it together
Forget everything you've ever known
Except for home
He made a promise he couldn't keep
I bet he's not losing a bit of sleep
Over how you're getting down the line
Now don't you fret, now don't you worry
Don't get in too much of a hurry
'Cause up ahead's that city limit sign
Sick and tired of being sick and tired
Everything around you's growin' old
The days drag on, the nights last forever
Every day's tougher just to keep it together
Forget everything you've ever known
Except for home
Home is where the heart is:
That's what somebody once said. (Yeah.)
I think your heart is where your love is:
All the rest baby, the rest it's all in your head
Well, memories, they're over-rated:
All they do is get you down an' frustrated
And who needs that on their back?
Starting over, cold turkey
Washin' your soul of everything that's dirty
Seal your heart of every crack
You're no longer sick and tired
Everything around you feels brand new
Yeah. the days fly by, the nights could be longer:
Every day you're just a little bit stronger
Now that you've spread your wings and flown
Back to home
Back to home
Back to home. (Home.)
Yeah, back to home
(Back to home.)
