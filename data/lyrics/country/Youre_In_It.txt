There's a front porch swing at your Momma's house
And a little stream up in the mountains
A shotgun seat and a, ocean breeze
There's a ferris wheel just spinnin' 'round
A midnight moonlight shining down
A red sunset in a cotton dress

You're in it
Every single good time
When I press rewind in my mind yeah I find
You're in it
Every thought of what could be
All I see is you and me
In my dreams and everything
I don't know what the future holds
All I know is girl you're in it

There's a small town cafe corner booth
Where I first laid my eyes on you
A melody that I keep singing
There's a baptist church on a county road
With everyone that we both know
There's wedding bells and a long white veil

You're in it
Every single good time
When I press rewind in my mind yeah I find
You're in it
Every thought of what could be
All I see is you and me
In my dreams and everything
I don't know what the future holds
All I know is girl you're in it
Yeah, girl you're in it

Fifty years on down the line
There's a rocking chair right next to mine
And girl you're in it
Yeah

You're in it
Every single good time
When I press rewind in my mind yeah I find
You're in it
Every thought of what could be
All I see is you and me
In my dreams and everything
I don't know what the future holds
All I know is girl you're in it
Yeah, girl you're in it
Oh, girl you're in it
Yeah, you're in it
