If I had just one tear running down your cheek
Maybe I could cope, maybe I'd get some sleep
If I had just one moment at your expense
Maybe all my misery would be well spent, yeah

Could you cry a little?
Lie just a little
Pretend that you're feeling a little more pain
I gave, now I'm wanting
Something in return
So cry just a little for me

If your love could be caged
Honey, I would hold the key
And conceal it underneath
The pile of lies you handed me
And you'd hunt those lies
They'd be all you'd ever find
And that'd be all you'd have to know
For me to be fine, yeah

Can you cry a little?
Die just a little
And baby, I would feel just a little less pain
I gave, now I'm wanting
Something in return
So cry just a little for me
Give it up, baby
I hear you're doing fine
Nothing's gonna save me
I can see it in your eyes
Some kind of heartache
Honey, give it a try
I don't want pity
I just want what is mine, yeah

Could you cry a little?
Lie just a little
Pretend that you're feeling a little more pain
I gave, now I'm wanting
Something in return
So cry just a little for me, yeah

Cry just a little for me
Oh, whoa, could you cry a little for me?
Yeah, yeah
