Far across deep blue water lives an old German's daughter
By the banks of the old River Rhine
Where I loved her and left her but I can't forget her
Cause I miss my pretty Fraulein
Fraulein Fraulein look up toward the heavens each night when the stars start to shine
By the same stars above you I swear that I love you you are my pretty Fraulein
When my memories wander away over yonder to the sweetheart that I left behind
In a moment of glory a face comes before me the face of my pretty Fraulein
Fraulein Fraulein...
