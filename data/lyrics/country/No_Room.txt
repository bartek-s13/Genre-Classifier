On a dark and cold starry night
Mary heavy with child
Whispered to Joseph, "I can't go on anymore"
So he wrapped her up in his arms
Said, "I'll find you some place warm"
But they were turned away at every door

No room, no room
Sorry but we're too full to let you in
No space, no place for the Baby Jesus
No room

Once again Christmas is here
The busiest time of the year
There's a growing list of last minute things to do
There's not many shopping days left
Still got presents to wrap
People to see and parties, we've got to go to

No room, no room
Sorry but life's too full to let you in
No space, no place for the Savior Jesus
No room
No room
No room
