Well, I get dressed in the dark each day
You used to think that was so sweet
By 6AM I'm in the car driving
I keep my change in the car ashtray
I haven't smoked in years and years
But lately I've been craving

I don't know how to pull you back
I don't know how to pull you close
All I know is how to wreck you
Something between us changed
I'm not sure if it's you or me
But lately, all I do seems to wreck you

Every now and then after work
I don't go straight home
I might sit out by the lake and wonder
I can almost see the face of a little blue eyed girl
And the boy who thought he knew everything about her

I don't know how to pull you back
I don't know how to pull you close
All I know is how to wreck you
Something between us changed
I'm not sure if it's you or me
But lately, all I do seems to wreck you

Well, I don't know what the hell you want from me
Is there something or someone I should be?
One of these nights I'll keep on driving

Cause I don't know how to pull you back
I don't know how to pull you close
All I know is how to wreck you
Something between us changed
I'm not sure if it's you or me
But lately, all I do seems to wreck you
