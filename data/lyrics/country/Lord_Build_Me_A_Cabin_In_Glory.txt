Lord, Build Me A Cabin In Glory
Many years I've been looking for a place to call home
But I've failed here to find it, so I must travel on;
I don't care for fine mansions on earth's sinking sand
Lord, build me a cabin in the corner of glory land

Yes, build me just a cabin in the corner of glory land
In the shade of the tree of life that it may ever stand;
Where I can just hear the angels sing, and shake Jesus' hand
Lord, build me a cabin in the corner of gloryland
Blessed Lord, I'm not asking to live in the midst
For I know I'm not worthy of such splendor as this
But I'm asking for mercy while humbly I stand
Lord, build me a cabin in the corner of gloryland

I have many dear loved ones who have gone on this way
On that great final morning, shall I hear them all say
Come and join in our singing and play in our band?
Lord, build me a cabin in the corner of gloryland
