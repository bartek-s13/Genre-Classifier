I bet you have never heard ol' Marshal Dillon say
"Miss Kitty, have you ever thought of running away
Settling down, would you marry me
If I asked you twice and begged you pretty please?"
She'd have said yes in a New York minute
They never tied the knot, his heart wasn't in it
He just stole a kiss as he rode away
He never hung his hat up
At Kitty's place

I should've been a cowboy
I should've learned to rope and ride
Wearing my six-shooter, riding my pony on a cattle drive
Stealing the young girls' hearts
Just like Gene and Roy
Singing those campfire songs
Oh, I should've been a cowboy

I might've had a sidekick with a funny name
Running wild through the hills chasing Jesse James
Ending up on the brink of danger
Riding shotgun for the Texas Rangers
Go west, young man, haven't you been told
California's full of whiskey, women and gold
Sleeping out all night beneath the desert stars
With a dream in my eye, and a prayer in my heart

I should've been a cowboy
I should've learned to rope and ride
Wearing my six-shooter, riding my pony on a cattle drive
Stealing the young girls' hearts
Just like Gene and Roy
Singing those campfire songs
Oh, I should have been a cowboy

I should've been a cowboy
I should've learned to rope and ride
I'd be wearing my six-shooter, riding my pony on a cattle drive
Stealing the young girls' hearts
Just like Gene and Roy
Singing those campfire songs
Oh, I should have been a cowboy

Yeah, I should've been a cowboy
I should have been a cowboy
