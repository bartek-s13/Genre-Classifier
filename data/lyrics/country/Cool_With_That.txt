Baby, what you doin' right now?
How'd you like to take a ride 'round?
Maybe watch the red sun go down
By the railroad tracks

Throw on a t-shirt and blue jeans
Or a little sundress, bare feet
Break out the Captain, iced tea
Or some Honey Jack
If you're cool with that

Say the word, I'm sitting all ready
I'll fire up my step-side Chevy
Got some George Strait blarin' on a mixtape
Ready to roll every road out the right way
The moonlight dances on still water
Midnight dip don't get no hotter
We can, cool off, dry off
Sittin' on the dock, kickin' back
Just me and you
If you're cool with that

Maybe I'll throw in my guitar
Maybe strike a chord in your heart
Under a blanket of stars
Off the beaten path
If you're cool with that

Say the word, I'm sitting all ready
I'll fire up my step-side Chevy
Got some George Strait blarin' on a mixtape
Ready to roll every road out the right way
The moonlight dances on still water
Midnight dip don't get no hotter
We can, cool off, dry off
Sittin' on the dock, kickin' back
Just me and you
If you're cool with that

And if you're cool with crashin' on the ground
Stayin' there 'til the sun comes back around
Let love take over
Get a whole lot closer, closer

Say the word, I'm sitting all ready
I'll fire up my step-side Chevy
Got some George Strait blarin' on a mixtape
Ready to roll every road out the right way
The moonlight dances on still water
Midnight dip don't get no hotter
We can, cool off, dry off
Sittin' on the dock, kickin' back
Just me and you
If you're cool with that

If you're cool with that, baby
Woah, oh
If you're cool with that
