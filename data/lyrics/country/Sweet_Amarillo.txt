Well the world's greatest wonder from what I can tell
Is how a cowgirl like you could ever look my way
I was blinded by glory with a half-written story
And a song spilling out off of every page
Sweet Amarillo
Tears on my pillow
You never will know
How much I cried
Sweet Amarillo
Like the wind in the willow
Damn this old cowboy
For my foolish pride
So I drifted on down from the Iron Ore Range
Across the wide Missouri where the cool waters flow
When I got to Topeka I looked up your name
But they said you rode off with the last rodeo
Sweet Amarillo
Tears on my pillow
You never will know
How much I cried
Sweet Amarillo
Like the wind in the willows
Damn this old cowboy
For my foolish pride
Well the thunder's a-rumbling and the tumbleweed's tumbling
And the rodeo clowns are painting their face
I'm gunning the throttle for Ilano Estacado
On a wild Appaloosa I'm blowing your way
Down in Old Amarillo there's a light in the window
Where a road weary shadow drifts into the arms
Of a long distance lover then they turn back the covers
And dance the Redova 'til the light of the dawn
Sweet Amarillo
Tears on my pillow
You never will know
How much I cried
Sweet Amarillo
Like the wind in the willows
Damn this old cowboy
For my foolish pride
Sweet Amarillo
Sweet Amarillo
