I'll admit, it got to me
Hearing your voice on my machine
It took all I had to just let you talk
And not pick up where we left off

Every night since your goodbye
I hit my knees and close my eyes
And I pray that you'd come back
Too many tears washed out that bridge
You wanna cross, but baby, it's too late for that

Last night would've been a different story
But the morning sun must've done something for me
Cause I bet I'd've gone the other way
If you'd've called yesterday
If you'd've called yesterday

This victory runs bitter sweet
Through the heart and soul of me
But I sip my coffee and watch the sun rise
Makin' its way to a bluer sky

Every night since your goodbye
I hit my knees and close my eyes
And I pray that you'd come back
Too many tears washed out that bridge
You wanna cross, but baby, it's too late for that

Last night would've been a different story
But the morning sun must've done something for me
'Cause I bet I'd've gone the other way
If you'd've called yesterday
If you'd've called yesterday

Last night would've been a different story
But the morning sun must've done something for me
Cause I bet I'd've gone the other way
If you'd've called yesterday
If you'd've called yesterday
If you'd've called yesterday
