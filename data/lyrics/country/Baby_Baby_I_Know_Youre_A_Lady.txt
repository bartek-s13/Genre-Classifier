Baby hear me callin' baby come over here and love me
Hold your lovin' body close to mine
Crazy you're drivin' me crazy maybe you don't mean to
But you never know what's goin' on in a woman's mind
I know you've been hurt before
You don't know what you're lookin' for and you're lonely
If you'll only let me stay I will kiss the tears away and love you forever
Baby I'm on my knees now baby I know that you're a lady
But I wanna watch the sun come up with you
Baby hear me callin' baby come over here and love me
Hold your lovin' body close to mine
I know that you're a lady but I wanna watch the sun come up with you
I know that you're a lady but sometimes a lady needs a little lovin' to
