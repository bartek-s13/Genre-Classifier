I've got a house and 90 acres some cattle in the barn
Two kids with no mama, she left in a saleman's arms
A sign by the mailbox says there's an auction in the
Yard
Born and raised has been damn easy but lately living's
Hard
The children miss their mama but there ain't nothing I
Can do
If she was all I had to worry about well I'd guess I'd
Miss her too
But I've watched my tools and tractor leave in someone
Else's hands
I grit my teeth, I'm let 'em go but I won't give up my
Land
This house and 90 acres, the only place I've left to
Stand
My roots are anchored solid, I ain't machinery I'm a
Man
I'll be here in the morning come pouring rain or sun
This house and 90 acres
What's said is good as done
There's jobs up in the city I could probably drive a
Truck
Or I could move 300 miles from home but that would be
Giving up
Well you know that I ain't leaving if it's just my
Pride I save
I might be on the front porch or I might be in a
Hillside grave
This house and 90 acres, the only place I've left to
Stand
My roots are anchored solid, I ain't machinery I'm a
Man
I'll be here in the morning come pouring rain or sun
This house and 90 acres
What's said is good as done
This house and 90 acres
