And just when I think that I'm about as high as any man could ever go
That's when I look at you and right on cue, your body moves
It's like it's putting on a show, yeah
Got to get to me, you pretty little tease
I just keep, I just keep

Falling for you, baby
You just keep killing me one kiss at a time
Ain't nothing now that's gonna save me
Mmm, your sweet love keeps calling
And I just keep falling

Eye to eye, your skin on mine
You slide your fingers through my hair and tell me "take it slow"
And I know what you want
And so I go down on my knees; I'm here to please
I just keep, I just keep

Falling for you, baby
You just keep killing me one kiss at a time
Ain't nothing now that's gonna save me
Ooh, your sweet love keeps calling
And I just keep falling
It's crazy, baby, what you do to me
There's magic in your kind of gravity
And any fool can see why I keep, I just keep

Falling for you, baby
You just keep killing me one kiss at a time
Ain't nothing now that's gonna save me
Ooh, your sweet love keeps calling
And I just, I just

I just keep falling for you, baby
You just keep killing me one kiss at a time
Ain't nothing now that's gonna save me
Ooh, your sweet love keeps calling
I just, I just keep falling
