My sweetheart has gone and I'm so lonely she said that she and I were through
So I started out drinking for past time drivin' nails in my coffin over you
I'm just drivin' nails in my coffin everytime I drink a bottle of booze
I'm just drivin' nails in my coffin Lord I'm drivin' those nails over you
Now ever since the day that we've parted I've been so sad and so blue
I'm always thinking of you love and I just can't quit drinking that old booze
I'm just drivin' nails in my coffin...
Now you've turned me down you don't want me there's nothing now I can lose
I'm just drivin' those nails in my coffin and worryin' my darlin' over you
I'm just drivin' nails in my coffin...
