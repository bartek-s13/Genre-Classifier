Neon lights, draw me like a moth to a flame
Mama raised me right that just leaves me to blame
When I get a little sideways on a honky-tonk tear
I'm old enough to know better but I'm still too young to care
Cowgirls with an attitude boots and tight blue jeans
Take my mind off doing right and doing other things
When the weekend's gone, I won't have a dime to spare
I'm old enough to know better, but I'm still too young to care
Monday morning, I wake up with a hammer in my hand
The boss-man yelling something at me that I don't understand
I don't know how I got to work, but I sure know I'm there
I'm old enough to know better, but I'm still too young to care
When the eagle flies on Friday, well he barely leaves the ground
I've got just enough left to get dressed up and head back to town
Boss says, "Son having all that fun won't get you anywhere"{
I'm old enough to know better, but I'm still too young to care
Monday morning I wake up with a hammer in my hand
The boss-man yelling something at me that I don't understand
I don't know how I got to work, but I sure know I'm there
I'm old enough to know better, but I'm still too young to care
I'm old enough to know better, but I'm still too young to care
