That you never thought you'd hear me say
I was thinking about going away
All these things locked inside
The jealousy and your foolish pride
I should've known
I should've known
You were just taking me for a ride
Along the way, lost control
I'm lucky that I even survived
Would you set the bridge on fire and watch it burn
Hey, life is full of hard lessons learned
You should've known that by now
No, you can't squeeze blood from a stone
Little darling, you reap what you sow
You should've known that by now
Whoah, you should've known
Talk is cheap
Life is short
And time, it just flies
Oh, and dreams captivate
Memories of the days gone by
I can see it in your eyes
You're not ready for the goodbye
But there's one thing you should know
Little darling, before you go
When you set the bridge on fire, you gotta watch it burn
Hey, life is full of hard lessons learned
You should've known that by now
No, you can't squeeze blood from a stone
Little darling, you reap what you sow
You should've known that by now
You should've known
You should've known
When you set the bridge on fire, you gotta watch it burn
Hey, life is full of hard lessons learned
You should've known that by now
No, you can't squeeze blood from a stone
Little darling, you reap what you sow
You should've known that by now
Ohhh, you should've known
Girl, you should've known
We both should've known
