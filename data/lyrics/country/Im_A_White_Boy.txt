Some folks call me a ramblin’ man
I do a lotta thumbin’ and a kickin’ cans
And it wouldn’t do an ounce of good to call my name
Cause daddy’s name wadn’t Willy Woodrow
And I wadn’t born and raised in no ghetto
Just a white boy lookin’ for a place to do my thing
Well I’m out to find me a wealthy woman
And a line of work that don’t take no diploma
I ain’t got much to lose but a lot to gain
Well some might call me a goodtime fella
I ain’t black and I ain’t yella
Just a white boy lookin’ for a place to do my thing
Yeah I don’t want no handout livin’
Don’t want any part of anything they’re givin’
I’m proud and white and I’ve got a song to sing
Well I’ve said a few things and I’ll admit it
If you wanna get ahead you gotta hump and get it
I’m a white boy lookin’ for a place to do my thing
Hump and git it now
Yeah I’m a small town boy been around a little
I like guitars and I like a fiddle
And that’s the kinda soul it takes to fan my flame
Well I’m a blue eyed Billy kinda frail and ruddy
So I’ll have to work to be somebody
I’m a white boy lookin’ for a place to do my thing
I don’t want no handout livin’
And don’t want any part of anything they’re givin’
I’m proud and white and I’ve got a song to sing
Well I’ve said a few things and I’ll admit it
If you wanna get ahead you gotta hump and get it
I’m a white boy lookin’ for a place to do my thing
I’m a white boy lookin’ for a place to do my thing
