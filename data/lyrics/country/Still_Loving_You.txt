We may spill a few tears
Say we lost a few years
That's just the way it goes
Sometimes love fades I suppose, oh-oh

We may slam a few doors
Say I can't do it anymore
That's just the way it goes
Can't fix it this time with a rose, oh-oh
We don't need to fight anymore

So tell me what's left
Tell me what's next
Are we just going to sit here and beat this to death
Just let go, 'cause baby we know
Where this is headed, and we'll just regret it
If we let this get too far gone
We'll forget what we had before things went wrong
So baby please I'm begging you
Let me leave, still loving you

Oh baby
I know someday, you'll find someone else
And when you do, it'll hurt like hell
But I'd rather see you smile
I ain't seen it in a while
So tell me what's left
Tell me what's next
Are we just going to sit here and beat this to death
Just let go, 'cause baby we know
Where this is headed, and we'll just regret it
If we let this get too far gone
We'll forget what we had before things went wrong
So baby please I'm begging you
Let me leave, still loving you

Oh no no, I don't want to fight anymore, no more, no
No I don't want to fight anymore
No we don't need to fight anymore

Cause there's nothing left (nothing left)
There's nothing next (nothing next)
So why should we sit here
And beat this to death
Just let go (let go)
Cause baby we know (baby we know)
Where this is headed and we'll just regret it
If we let this get too far gone
We'll forget what we had before things went wrong
So baby please I'm begging you
After all that we've been through
So let me leave, still loving you
Still loving you
