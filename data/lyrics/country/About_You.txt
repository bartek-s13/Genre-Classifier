This song ain't a summertime song
Meant to make you sing along
That you make your ringtone
No it ain't about the good stuff
It damn sure ain't a raise it up if you got one
It ain't about the best weekend, turn it up to 10
A party with your friends
You know, the feel good kind
You won't hear none of those lines
In this one

It's about breakin' up and wakin' up
And stayin' tough, and Makers Mark
Toppin' off a coffee cup
And pray it does the trick to forget
At least for a little while
It's about words that hurt, the verses burn
The worst mistakes and lessons learned
And gettin' what you deserve
Instead of gettin' back what you had to lose
Yeah boy, this one's about you
Yeah, this one's about you

Boy it might not be your jam or make you wanna dance
But do you remember when you told me to write you a song
Probably not what you meant
Oh, but baby I finally did

It's about breakin' up and wakin' up
And stayin' tough, and Makers Mark
Toppin' off a coffee cup
And pray it does the trick to forget
At least for a little while
It's about words that hurt, the verses burn
The worst mistakes and lessons learned
And gettin' what you deserve
Instead of gettin' back what you had to lose
Yeah boy, this one's about you
Yeah, this one's about you

No this ain't no girl get's the guy back in the last line
Unless you change your mind

It's about breakin' up and wakin' up
And stayin' tough, and Makers Mark
Toppin' off a coffee cup
And pray it does the trick to forget
At least for a little while
It's about words that hurt, the verses burn
The worst mistakes and lessons learned
And gettin' what you deserve
Instead of gettin' back what you had to lose
Yeah boy, this one's about you
Yeah, this one's about you
