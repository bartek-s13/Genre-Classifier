Sirens wail and a flashin' light
Nothing better to do on a Tuesday night
But give me hell
Where you headed, what are you out for?
We don't see much of you 'round here anymore
I guess it's just as well
Well once upon a time you had it all
You let everybody down
You're always seventeen in your hometown
Running from your folks, running from the law
Running from love, running from your fears, running from it all
You keep on running boy
You run yourself in the ground
You're always seventeen in your hometown
Her porch swing still looks the same
She probably won't even remember my name
Just like she didn't back then
Is she married, is she doing fine
Does she know about all the nights I lay awake crying
Just to know her hand?
The door opens and I run away, just like the same 'ole clown
You're always seventeen in your hometown
Running from your folks, running from the law
Running from love, running from your fears, running from it all
You keep on running boy
You run yourself in the ground
You're always seventeen in your hometown
Well nobody is gonna miss me
No tears will fall, no one's gonna weep
When I hit that road
My boots are broken, my brain is sore
From keeping up with their little world
I got a heavy load
Gonna leave 'em on just like before, I'm big city bound
You're always seventeen in your hometown
Running from your folks, running from the law
Running from love, running from your fears, running from it all
You keep on running boy
You run yourself in the ground
You're always seventeen
Yeah, you're always seventeen
You're always seventeen in your hometown
