I was drivin' to town and I passed by a house
The one with pillars on the porch
Had a sign on the door said "for sale"
So what the hell
I walked in, and sat down on some strangers couch
Solid Oak Hardwood floors
Didn't need to see more
'Cause I could hear you in the kitchen
Playin' your guitar
All our friends coming over
Little lights in the yard

And dammit
Didn't we almost have it?
Honestly, I still don't understand it
We used to love to sit and talk and wish
And picture and planin'
Man, now I just...dammit

I think the owners could tell I was lost in myself
So they left me alone, said "make yourself right at home"
I was already makin' dinner
Callin' you down the stairs
Little girl out the window
Hear her laughin' out there
Dammit
Didn't we almost have it?
Honestly, I still don't understand it
We used to love to sit and talk and wish
And picture and planin'
Man now, I just...dammit
Baby, didn't we almost have it?
Honestly, I still don't understand it
We used to love to sit, talk and wish
And picture and plan it
Man, now I just... dammit

Now I'm driving away
Thinking "oh, what a shame"
You can pray, you can hope
But you just never know
I guess that two bedroom picket fence magic
Can't ever be ours now, can it?
(Dammit)

Ooh
Honestly, I still don't understand it
Thinking how could we, coulda had it
We coulda had it
Dammit
