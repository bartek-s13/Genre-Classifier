Scatter gun blast, tens in the air
Half a million in a burlap sack
Y'all have a nice day as we make our way
To the caddie in the ally out back
See when the times get hard
Some good old boys turn to a life a sin
We're like Robin Hood, we're just twice as good
But we can never go home again
Well I grew up singing Amazing Grace
In a little white church in the woods
My momma prayed hard for all her boys
But her praying didn't do a bit of good
The sheriff and a banker man came to push us off of our land
Now we're six feet deep
And my brothers and me we can never go home again
Lord forgive me, I know just what I do
I'll take what I need and then
I leave the rest to my momma and you
And that tin roof cabin might not have been heaven
But it's closer than I've ever been
God bless an outlaw's weary soul
I can never go home again
Sometimes I dream of that old front porch and my momma patching up a quilt
While my brothers and me lay around in the shade of that live oak tree on the hill
Now it's hide-out shacks, better watch your back and cover every track of where you've been
A thousand wrongs will never make it right, I can never go home again
Lord forgive me, I know just what I do
I'll take what I need and then
I leave the rest to my momma and you
And that tin roof cabin might not have been heaven
But it's closer than I've ever been
God bless an outlaw's weary soul
I can never go home again
Scatter gun blast tears a ten inch hole
Through an empty burlap sack
As I say my peace for my brothers and me
My whole world fades to black
Here's three new graves underneath the shade of
That live oak tree on the hill
Overlooking momma's porch with a fresh coat of paint
And a shiny new Coup De Ville
Lord forgive me, I know just what I've done
I've been through hell and found myself on the wrong end of a gun
And that tin roof cabin might not have been heaven but it's closer than I've ever been
God bless an outlaw's weary soul, I thought I'd never make it home
God bless an outlaw's weary soul, I guess I finally made it home again
