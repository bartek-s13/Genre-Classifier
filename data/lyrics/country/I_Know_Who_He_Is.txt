Please, Doc, put away your chart
You can save your heart-to-heart
I've got some memories in a deck of cards
That could use some shufflin' through
Looks like he's still wide awake
Looks like he still won't take
Those pills you put there yesterday
Huh, just stubborn as a mule

I don't wanna hear "He's goin' downhill"
What about "Thank God he's around still"
Lookin' right through me's
Not at all the way I see it
I don't mind at all rememberin' for him
He doesn't have to get why I adore him
He don't have to know me
I know who he is

My dad, my coach, my friend
The voice behind "Boy, where the hell you been?"
The lover of my mama through thick and thin
The best man I've ever known
All-time quarterback when us kids were in a bind
Cheek full of Redman in a duck blind
No offense, Doc, but if you don't mind
I'd like some time alone

I don't wanna hear "He's goin' downhill"
What about "Thank God he's around still"
Lookin' right through me's
Not at all the way I see it
I don't mind at all rememberin' for him
He doesn't have to get why I adore him
He don't have to know me
I know who he is

Full of pride, baby boy on his knee there
Full of life with a beer in a beach chair
Aw, he's a fixture
In my head full of pictures

I don't mind at all rememberin' for him
He doesn't have to get why I adore him
He don't have to know me
I know who he is
Aw, I know who he is
Yeah, I love who he is
Yeah I love, I love, I love who he is
