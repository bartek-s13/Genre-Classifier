When the way seems dark and long
Hold to my hand dear Lord I pray
Give me grace to shout and shine
Ever in the life divine
Lord lead me on from day to day
Oh lead me on from day to day
I want to walk the holy way
Oh friends forsake me all along
I asked the Lord to lead me on
In this world of doubt and gloom
When all flowers start to bloom
Hold to my hand dear Lord I pray
I have put my faith in thee
'Til the homely hour shall be
Lord lead me on from day to day
When old age is feeling on
And my strength is almost gone
Hold to my hand dear I pray
Surely thou will n'er forsake
And in heaven I'll awake
Lord lead me on from day to day
