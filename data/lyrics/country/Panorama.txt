'Bout time we laid back and just let time just float on by
Nothing but the panorama and my baby by my side
Girl, we got a good view‚ doing what we're made to
Yeah‚ listen to the wind blow‚ it goes

Ooh, ooh

Night-singing in the midnight moon
Soundtrack to me and you
Silence and two hearts on fire
Look at the stars tonight
In the sky, in your eyes
You know what your love feels like
It feels like

Laying back on a blanket‚ looking at a blanket way up high
Between the darkness in the distance
And the way the whole thing shines
Makes you feel like you see God
Makes you feel like you're alive for the first time
Like you were my first time

Ooh, ooh

Night-singing in the midnight moon
Soundtrack to me and you
Silence and two hearts on fire
Look at the stars tonight
In the sky, in your eyes
You know what your love feels like

It feels like (Ooh‚ ooh)
It feels like (Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)

The way the world turns, baby
Don't it just seem crazy
That a boy and a girl could fall in love?
Think about how fast it goes
Think about how we don't know anything at all
Except it does

Ooh, ooh

Nights-singing in the midnight moon
Soundtrack to me and you
Silence and two hearts on fire
Look at the stars tonight
In the sky, in your eyes
You know what your love feels like

It feels like (Ooh, ooh)
It feels like (Ooh, ooh)
Don't it feel like (Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)

'Bout time we laid back and just let time just float on by
Nothing but the panorama, listen to the wind blow
