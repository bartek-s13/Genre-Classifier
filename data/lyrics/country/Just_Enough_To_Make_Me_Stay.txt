She never says the little things that make me warmer
Unless she wants things to go her way
Cause time and time again I've tried to leave her
And she does just enough to make me stay
She never says the loving words I need to hear
And it hurts because she knows the words to say
When she hears me cleaning out my drawers and closet
She says just enough to make me stay
Sometimes I wonder how I've stayed this long
Like a fool I keep hanging round for more
When she acts like I'm already gone
Until I start to walk out the door then like before
She never gives me the love she knows I'm needing
And she knows I need it more and more each day
And when she sees I can't take it any longer
She gives me just enough to make me stay
Just enough to make me stay
