I couldn't sleep last night so I went for a drive
Passin' all them old street lights we used to fly by
I took a couple wrong turns and I wound up on your street
Yeah your house is creepin' closer, wonder if I should come over
Should I come over?

If I turn right, would it really be wrong
Would it just be another sad old song
Would it just be a wrong turn, that I can't forget
Or would it be the best damn mistake that I've made yet
Oh would it be wrong?

I picked up a old photograph and I pressed it to my cheek
Yeah my knees are gettin' weak baby I still can't sleep
No I can't sleep

If I turn right, would it really be wrong
Would it just be another sad old song
Would it just be a wrong turn, that I can't forget
Or would it be the best damn mistake that I've made yet
Oh would it be wrong?
Babe your house is on the right
And I can see that you ain't left
Baby missin' you is just hard to do so I must confess

That if I turn right, I don't care if it's wrong
'Cause there won't be just another sad old song
It won't be a wrong turn that I can't forget
It'll be the best damn mistake that I've made yet
Oh baby it ain't wrong
