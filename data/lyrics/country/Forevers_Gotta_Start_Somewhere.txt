8 a.m. on a downtown train
I would have walked up and asked your name
Midnight in a crowded room
I would have had to come talk to you
Anywhere, I don't care
Forever’s gotta start somewhere

Dance floor of a dive bar
You would have walked by and stole my heart
Summer night at the county fair
I would have stopped in my tracks and stared
And I'd have known right then and there
Forever's gotta start somewhere

This could be the first night of the rest of our lives
We started something right here
You’ll call it crazy, but I think we'll make it
Forever's gotta start somewhere
Forever's gotta start somewhere

Girl I know you must think
Another guy tryin' to buy you a drink
Two for one on a Tuesday
How can a good thing start this way
But it could end up anywhere
Forever's gotta start somewhere
This could be the first night of the rest of our lives
We started something right here
You'll call it crazy, but I think we'll make it
Forever’s gotta start somewhere
Forever’s gotta start somewhere

Yeah, it's a long shot
But it’s all that I got
Can't let you walk out of here

This could be the first night of the rest of our lives
We started something right here
You'll call it crazy, but I think we'll make it
Forever’s gotta start somewhere
This could be the first night of the rest of our lives
We started something right here
You'll call it crazy, but I think we'll make it
Forever's gotta start somewhere
Forever's gotta start somewhere
Forever's gotta start somewhere

Yeah, it's a long shot
But it's all that I got
Can't let you walk out of here
