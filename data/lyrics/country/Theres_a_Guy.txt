THERE'S A GUY
THINKS I LOOK GOOD IN HIS OLD BALL CAP
HE DON'T MIND
IF I DON'T GIVE HIM HIS T SHIRTS BACK
MAKES ME LAUGH WHEN HE TOPS MY PUNCH LINE
HOLD ME WHEN I CRY
YEAH THERE'S A GUY

AND HE'S NOTHING
NOTHING LIKE BOYS I'VE KNOWN
HE AIN'T AFRAID TO COME BACK HOME
SHAKE MY DADDYS HAND AND HOLD MINE IN FRONT OF HIS FRIENDS

GOT SOMETHING OF HIS OWN GOING ON
AIN'T ANOTHER HANGER ON
DON'T PLAY GAMES
KNOWS HOW TO FIGHT
AND WHEN TO LET ME WIN

HE MIGHT BUY ME A DRINK OR JUST SAY HI
I MIGHT LIKE HIS SMILE BUT CAN'T SAY WHY

HE JUST MIGHT FALL OUT OF THE SKY
BUT

THERE'S A GUY
LOOKING FOR A GIRL LIKE ME
HE'S COOL IF I DON'T RUSH INTO ANYTHING
