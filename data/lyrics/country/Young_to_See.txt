I won't forget the day I found
My first place on the edge of town
A few milk crates, a beat-up couch and an old T.V
A little rundown, a little bit small
But to me it was the Taj Mahal
It's just one of those things you gotta be young to see
Friday night, what the hell, let's go
And just like that we were on a roll
Three best friends and a radio, that was all we'd need
We put a thousand miles on an old red jeep
Just to watch the sun rise on the beach
It's just one of those things you gotta be young to see
When you're young
There's plenty of time to get older
Once you're old
That's all you'll ever be
Yeah, that's the beauty to livin' life
Wild and free
It's just one of those things you gotta be young to see
I left home around 22
Mama was beggin' me to finish school
But there was nothing they could do, it was up to me
So I packed my bags and an old guitar
Cause if you're ever gonna be a star
It's just one of those things you gotta be young to see
When you're young
There's plenty of time to get older
Once you're old
That's all you'll ever be
Yeah, that's the beauty to livin' life
Wild and free
It's just one of those things you gotta be young to see
So grow your hair, get a new tattoo
Quit your job and go to Bonnaroo
Whatever it is you wanna do
Or think or be
Don't put it off too many years
Cause some of the best stuff disappears
I ain't old enough to know but I believe
Yeah, there's some things you gotta be young to see
