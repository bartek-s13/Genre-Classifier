Look at me:
I'm in a place
I never thought I'd be
I don't have the strength
To fight anymore
Or a reason not to leave
So tell me why I keep holding on
To something I just cannot see
What makes you stay when your world falls apart?
What makes you try one more time when it's not in your heart?
At the end of your rope, when you can't find any hope
You still look at him and say
"I just can't walk away."
Tell me what makes you stay
I'm not afraid of living alone
I was alone before he came
And I've been in love
Many times before
But this time's not the same
I've always been the first to say goodbye...
Now it's the last thing I can do
What makes you stay when your world falls apart?
What makes you try one more time when it's not in your heart?
At the end of your rope, when you can't find any hope
You still look at him and say
"I just can't walk away
Tell me what makes you stay."
When it goes this deep
Feels this strong
I can't convince myself
This love is wrong
At the end of your rope
When you can't find any hope
You still look at him and say
"I just can't walk away...
Tell me what makes you stay
Tell me what makes you... stay."
