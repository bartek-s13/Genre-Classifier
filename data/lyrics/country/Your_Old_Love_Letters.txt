Today, I burned your old love letters;
I burned them gently, one by one
And as I light the flame, I'd read it
So I could see what you had done
The first you wrote me was the sweetest:
The last one broke my heart in two
Our love now lies among the embers
In the ashes of your letters tied in blue
And as I burned your old love letters
It brought back mem'ries from the past
It told about you and your new love
A love I knew could never last
The first you wrote me was the sweetest:
The last one broke my heart in two
And as I light the flame, I'd read it
For I can say: "I still love you."
