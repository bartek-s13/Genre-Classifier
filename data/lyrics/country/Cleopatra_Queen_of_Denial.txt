Well I said he had a lot of potential
He was only misunderstood
You know, he really didn't mean to treat me so bad
He wanted to be good
And I swore one day I would tame him
Even though he loved to run hog wild
Just call me Cleopatra, everybody
'Cause I'm the Queen of Denial

I knew he didn't have any money
Yeah, that's why he couldn't buy me a ring
Oh and just because he bought himself a brand new pick-up truck
Really didn't prove anything
And he never had to say he loved me
I could see it every time he smiled
Just call me Cleopatra, everybody
'Cause I'm the Queen of Denial

Oh Queen of Denial
Buying all his alibis
Queen of Denial
Floating down a river of lies, yeahhh

Well I'm not gonna jump to conclusions
Or throw away this perfect romance
Even though I saw him dancing last night
With a girl in leopard skin pants
Oh he's probably stuck in traffic
And he'll be here in a little while
Just call me Cleopatra, everybody
'Cause I'm the Queen of Denial

Oh Queen of Denial
Buying all his alibis
Queen of Denial
Just floating down a river of lies, oh yeahhh
