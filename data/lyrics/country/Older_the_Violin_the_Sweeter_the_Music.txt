OLDER THE VIOLIN THE SWEETER THE MUSIC
Writer Curly Putman
It seems you think that 45 is just a little too old now
But I'm not ready yet to be put out in the cold now
I got plenty of good love left woman if you'll just use it
You know the older the violin the sweeter the music
And I can play a symphony of love
Like a thousand violins singing from above
You're gonna really miss my loving one day when you lose it
You know the older the violin the sweeter the music
These specks of gray that's in my hair just make me look distinguished
They don't mean I'm over the hill baby I'm not extinguished
There's plenty of young girl's waiting for my love honey they won't refuse it
They know the older the violin the sweeter the music
And I can play a symphony of love
Like a thousand violins singing from above
You're gonna really miss my loving one day when you lose it
You know the older the violin the sweeter the music
And I can play a symphony of love
Like a thousand violins singing from above
You're gonna really miss my loving one day when you lose it
You know the older the violin the sweeter the music
