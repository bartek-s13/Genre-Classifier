Roll, won't you come roll with me
Slow, fast, full speed
Girl where ever sweet time takes us
Hang, with me down this old road
Only God knows where we'll go
Don't matter long as I've got your love

I don't ever wanna wake up
Looking into someone else's eyes
With another voice calling me "baby"
On the other end of the phone
A new girl puttin' on her make up
For a dinner on a Friday night
I don't ever wanna know, no, no, no
No other shotgun rider beside me
Singin' to the radio, ooo, oo

Slide, slide over nice and close
Lay your head down on my shoulder
You can fall asleep, I'll let you
Dream, life ain't nothing but a dream
Don't wanna be, cruisin' through this dream without you

I don't ever wanna wake up
Looking into someone else's eyes
Another voice calling me "baby"
On the other end of the phone
A new girl puttin' on her make up
For a dinner on a Friday night
No I don't ever wanna know, no, no, no
No other shotgun rider beside me
Singin' to the radio, ooo, oo
