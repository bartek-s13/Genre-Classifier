Imagine a world where no music was playin'
And think of a church with nobody prayin'
Have you ever looked up at a sky with no blue
Then you've seen a picture of me without you
Have you walked in a garden where nothing was growin'
Or stood by a river where nothing was flowin'
If you've seen a red rose, unkissed by the dew
Then you've seen a picture of me without you
Can you picture heaven with no angels singin'
Or a bright Sunday mornin' with no church bells ringin'
If you've watched as the heart of a child breaks in two
Then you've seen a picture of me without you
Can you picture heaven with no angels singin'
Or a bright Sunday mornin' with no church bells ringin'
If you've watched as the heart of a child breaks in two
Then you've seen a picture of me without you
Then you've seen a picture of me without you
