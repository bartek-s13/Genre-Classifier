I hear the beat out on the street
You're looking for something sweet
Well I don't know if that's me
But baby you're worth a shot
I got a sugar bowl in the kitchen
I put honey all over my biscuits
And if you like the sound of them fixings
I'll give you all that I got

Come on, come on
There's a hidden little spot down an old dirt road
Come on, come on
Where the stars come out and the moonlight glows
Come on, come on
It's a pretty little scene with the birds and the bees
I'll go to fall in love, baby tell me is that sweet enough?

I can tell by the way you're grinning
I think I might have gotten your attention
Just to get you listening, I must be doing alright
I'm just a country bumpkin, I don't own sweet for nothing
But baby you can teach me something
Baby let's take a ride
