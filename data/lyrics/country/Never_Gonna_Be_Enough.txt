You like to live a life, scared to take a fall
Still you go out every night getting drunk and getting high trying to risk it all
You show everything you got, never close your eyes
And it’s hard to sleep alone when you’ll never have home in a house of lies
And still you try
Where you gonna run when your river runs dry, reach out your hands baby kiss that sky
Who you gonna call when it gets rough, try it all alone but you’re never gonna be enough
You try to see the light, take a chance again
Baby it ain’t no secret that all the promises you keep ain’t worth remembering
Oh them demons in your head, write’em in your songs
And its sure is all healthy when you put the pen to paper get to right your wrongs
But it’s the same old song
Where you gonna run when your river runs dry
Reach out your hands baby kiss that sky
Who you gonna call when it gets rough, try it all alone but you’re never gonna be enough
Yeah, where you gonna run when your river runs dry
Reach out your hands baby kiss that sky, who you gonna call when it gets rough, try it on your own but you’re never gonna be enough
Enough
