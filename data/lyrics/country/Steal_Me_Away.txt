Maybe Mama should've named me 'small town'
That's the only world I've ever known
I've never dreamed a dream beyond the sundown
There's plenty boys around this place
I wouldn't die alone
Ooh, these thoughts spinning in my head
'Bout who I want to be instead 'cause

I like blue
Won't you buy me something red?
I prefer these boots
Buy me heels instead
I like to play it safe
Crash me on the rocks
Come in like a thief
I'll leave my heart unlocked
And steal me away

You're like a brand new song I want to turn up
You're the colors that I didn't know exist
Wrap me in your arms
Take me somewhere far, far away
Steal me now, steal me now I won't resist cause
I like blue
Won't you buy me something red?
I prefer these boots
Buy me heels instead
I like to play it safe
Crash me on the rocks
Come in like a thief
I'll leave my heart unlocked
And steal me away

Ooh, you put a window in my wall
Ooh, with you I want to see it all
Ooh, you're like a brand new day
Ooh, stealing me away cause

I like blue
Won't you buy me something red?
I prefer these boots
Buy me heels instead
I'm a small town soul
Show me broadway lights
I'm a morning girl keep me up all night
I like to play it safe
Crash me on the rocks
Come in like a thief
I'll leave my heart unlocked
And steal me away
Steal me away
