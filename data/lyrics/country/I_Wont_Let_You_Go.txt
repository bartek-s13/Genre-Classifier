I know better
Still wish it were easier
Back and forth, the up and down
Caught up in a moment
The words start flying
We go round and round and round
No sign of a finish line
Never a real last time
I know that this is hard to do
You loving me, me loving you
So long since we
Have felt brand new
But I won't let you go
I wish I knew the reasons why
The scenes we only falsified
No matter who is wrong or right
I won't let you go
I won't ever let you go
You say that it's over
Can't go on any longer
Trying to be the perfect wife
So sick of tomorrow
Oh, it never changes
Hell, I even hate myself sometimes
But I swore till my dying day
I swear that won't ever change
I know that this is hard to do
You loving me, me loving you
So long since we
Have felt brand new
But I won't let you go
I wish I knew the reasons why
The scenes we only falsified
No matter who is wrong or right
I won't let you go
I won't ever let you go
I know that this is hard to do
You loving me, me loving you
So long since we
Have felt brand new
But I won't let you go
I wish I knew the reasons why
The scenes we only falsified
No matter who is wrong or right
I won't let you go
I won't ever let you go
I know better
Still wish it were easier
Back and forth, the up and down
