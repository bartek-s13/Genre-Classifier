I got drunk, you got drunk
We had sex, we woke up
Caught up in a thread count, tangled in skin
Now you're checking your phone, he's checking in

And it's right now that I start to see it
All of the weight of the way that it is
Caught between what it means to start over
And what happens over and over again, but

I don't wanna hold you, I don't wanna hold you
I don't wanna hold you back
I don't wanna see you, I don't wanna see you
I don't wanna see you hurt like that
You had your heart in a cage
I'll cut you loose, baby, fly away
I'm holding on to what we had
But I don't wanna hold you, I don't wanna hold you back

I get up, you get up
We get dressed, say I love you
Kiss you goodbye and I finally mean it
It took until now for us both to believe it
And it's not like we got back together
We're just coming back to the thing that we know
When you called it off, you said it's for the better
That don't make it easy for me to let go, baby

I don't wanna hold you, I don't wanna hold you
I don't wanna hold you back
I don't wanna see you, I don't wanna see you
I don't wanna see you hurt like that
You had your heart in a cage
I'll cut you loose, baby, fly away
I'm holding on to what we had
But I don't wanna hold you, I don't wanna hold you back

Well, call me up if you ever get lonely
Call me up if you ever want me
But until then, I'm setting you free
And if you ever come back to me, baby

I don't wanna hold you, I don't wanna hold you
I don't wanna hold you back
I don't wanna see you, I don't wanna see you
I don't wanna see you hurt like that
You had your heart in a cage
I'll cut you loose, baby, fly away
I'm holding on to what we had
But I don't wanna hold you, I don't wanna hold you back
