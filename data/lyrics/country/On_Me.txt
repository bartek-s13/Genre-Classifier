Like wings on a plane
You got me flying, I'm flying
Like a diamond on a ring
Look at you shining, you shining
You know what you're doing
The way you make me lose it
It ain't just the music
That songs girl, oh it's on girl
You got your hands on me
Your eyes on me
I don't mind you spilling that drink on me
Next one's on me
Yeah and that's on me
Girl, I'm all about, all about you
And the way you move in a little closer
Laying your head on my shoulder
Looks good on me
Yeah, so if I fall for you
Well that's on me
Damn you girl, my head's spinning, it's spinning
You didn't mean to do it, but you did it, you did it
My attention yeah you got it
You went two ways about it
It ain't just the music
That song girl, oh it's on girl
You got your hands on me
Your eyes on me
I don't mind you spilling that drink on me
Next one's on me
Yeah and that's on me
Girl, I'm all, I'm all about you
And the way you move in a little closer
Laying your head on my shoulder
Looks good on me
Yeah, so if I fall for you
Well that's on me
Yeah, baby, I could lie
Blame it on the night
Of that disco ball, lighting up your eyes
I could say it ain't true
I ain't falling for you
Well hey, what am I gonna do
When you got your hands on me
Your eyes on me
I don't mind you spilling that drink on me
Next one's on me
Yeah and that's on me
Girl, I'm all about, all about you
And the way I pull you in a little closer
Laying your head on my shoulder
Looks good on me
Yeah, so if I fall for you
Well that's on me
Yeah that's on me
If I fall for you
That's on, that's on, that's on, that's on me
That's on me
Oh if I fall for you
That's on me
