You can blame me
Try to shame me
Still I'll care for you
You can run around
Even let me down
Still I'll be there for you

The world may think I'm foolish
But they can't see you like I can
Oh, but anyone who knows what love is
Will understand
Anyone
Anyone

I fell sorry
Oh, so sorry
For those who pity me
'Cause they just don't know
No, they just don't know
How good our love can be

I know to ever let you go
Would be more than I can stand
Oh, and anyone who knows what love is
Will understand
Anyone
Anyone

The world may think I'm foolish
But they can't see you like I can
Oh, but anyone who knows what love is
Will understand
Anyone
