Saw a man on the sidewalk
Hunger written in red chalk
Maybe he just wanted to talk
But I walked away
Saw a kid on the TV
He was only seventeen
Wrapped his truck
Round an Oak tree
The whole town prayed
I should go to church sometime
I should go to church sometime
Easter and Christmas
Yeah, I don't ever miss it
I ask for forgiveness
They tell me what
I like to hear
But I need a revival
For this prodigal deciple
Wipe the dust off my bible
More than once or twice a year
I should go to church sometime
Maybe walk a little straighter line
Lord knows I could use the light
To get where I'm going
I shouldn't say next Sunday
I shouldn't let my pride
Get in the way
I know I shouldn't be afraid
(Shouldn't be afraid)
Of what I know I'll find
I should go to church sometime
I should go to church sometime
Nah, it ain't until you're sinkin'
Til you really start listening
You get down on your knees
Down on your knees
You swear it's the last time
That you'll say
I should go to church sometime
Maybe walk a little straighter line
Lord knows I could use the light
To get where I'm going
I shouldn't say next Sunday
I shouldn't let my pride
Get in the way
I know I shouldn't be afraid
(Shouldn't be afraid)
Of what I know I'll find
I should go to church sometime
I should go to church sometime
