The things that I love
And hold dear to my heart
They're just borrowed
They're not mine at all
Jesus only let me use them
To brighten my life
So remind me, remind me dear Lord
Nothing good have I done
To deserve God's own Son
I'm not worthy of the scars in His hands
Yet he chose the road to Calvary
To die in my stead
Why He loved me I just can't understand
Roll back the curtain of memory now and then
Show me where you brought me from
And where I might have been
But remember I'm human and human's forget
So remind me, remind me dear Lord
