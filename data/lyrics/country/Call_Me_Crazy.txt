Rain rushing down on my window pane
Traffic stands like soldiers in a field of blame
My heart lies with you in another place
Cause you are nowhere near and i’m alone again

Just like a ghost disguised as audio
Your favourite song comes thru on my radio
It’s a flash of joy trapped in a moments pain
Cause you are nowhere near and i’m alone again

Call me crazy but sometimes I feel you here
And I chase your footsteps and watch you disappear
Yeah I hear your voice and I see your face
Like you never left this place
And I don’t know what i’m gonna do
I’m trying to move on and i can’t figure out who’s holding on to whom

Friends will come and build a wall around your heart
And make you strong and ready for a brand new start
Then all at once somebody goes and speaks your name
And even in that crowd i’m alone again

So call me crazy but sometimes i feel you here
And I chase your footsteps and watch you disappear
And I hear your voice and I see your face
Like you never left this place
And I don’t know what i’m gonna do
I’m trying to move on and i can’t figure out who’s holding on
Who’s holding on

To the life we had
To the rules we broke
To the plans we made together that you left to me alone
To every dream, every good night kiss
And so you had to leave
Did you have to leave, like this

So call me crazy but sometimes I feel you here
And I chase your footsteps and watch you disappear
And I hear your voice and I see your face
Like you never left this place
And I don’t know what i’m gonna do
I’m trying to move on and i can’t figure out
Who’s holding on

Who’s holding on
Who’s holding on
Trying to move on but can’t figure out
Who’s holding on to whom
