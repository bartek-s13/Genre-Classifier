Let me carry your burden
If somethin' ain’t right, I will let you know
Like the paint that's drying on a heart that's broke
Let me carry your burden

I’ll get you back on a high when you're feeling low
When the weight's too heavy, but you won't let go

Come to me, my brother, and I will sit with you awhile
Pretty soon, I'll see you smile and you know you will
No matter how much you're hurting right now
You know that everything will change in time
So let me carry your burden
Let me carry your burden

When your mouth's on fire, but your mind is cold
And you're fanning flames that won’t keep you warm

Come to me, my brother, and I will sit with you a while
Pretty soon, I’ll see you smile and you know you will
No matter how much you're hurting right now
You know that everything will change in time
Let me carry your burden, oh brother of mine

Let me carry your burden
Come tomorrow, you’ll be right as rain
It'll quench your fire, wash away your stains
Ooh, yes, it will, yeah

Come to me, my brother, and I will sit with you a while
Pretty soon, I'll see you smile and you know you will
Oh, it don't matter how much you’re hurting right now
You know that everything will change in time
I just might see it in another life
I got no dog here in the fight
I could carry your burden, oh brother of mine

Oh yeah
I could carry your burden, yeah
I could carry your burden
Carry your, carry your burden
Oh, yes, I can, yes, I can
