Sitting at the corner of an old crossroads
Yellow light, red light, green light, go
I can't hit the gas
Can't turn the wheel
Can't go back and make a deal
Sun ain't up
Moon's gone away
Sure gets dark before the light of day
It's a long way there and it's a long way home
And there ain't no map for the road I'm on
Wind won't blow
Stars won't shine
Been that way for the longest time
Looking for something to show me the way
Sure gets dark before the light of day
Running out of time
Running out of gas
Lucky as a mirror with a broken glass
Now I know what they mean when they say
Sure gets dark before the light of day
Can't stay here
Can't turn around
Ain't no trouble like the kind I've found
I guess this is the price I pay
Sure gets dark before the light of day
Sure gets dark before the light of day
