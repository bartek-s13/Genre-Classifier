These wheels can't spin fast enough
And I can't wait to see you light up
We've got all night girl, there ain't no rush
But my hearts racing just thinking 'bout

The way you look, the way I feel
The way you move me standing still
Say the word you know I will
You know I will

'Cause I get chills
When I see you on Friday night
Steppin' out on the porch in the moonlight, so fine
If you got time, I got time girl
'Cause I get chills
Downtown and we skip the line
And I watch you dance in the party lights, so fine
Cause you're mine, all mine girl
Yeah I get chills, oh whoah
Yeah I get chills, oh whoah
I get chills

The way you're walking in that little black dress
Girl, you got me and you know it
Same one you wore on the night we met
Aw, don't think I didn't notice
The way you look, the way I feel
The way you move me standing still
Say the word you know I will
You know I will, you know I still will

'Cause I get chills
When I see you on Friday night
Steppin' out on the porch in the moonlight, so fine
If you got time, I got time girl
'Cause I get chills
Downtown and we skip the line
And I watch you dance in the party lights, so fine
Cause you're mine, all mine girl
Cause I get chills, oh woah
Yeah I get chills, oh woah
I get chills


I get chills, oh whoah
I get chills, oh whoah

'Cause I get chills
When I see you on Friday night
Steppin' out on the porch in the moonlight, so fine
If you got time, I got time girl
'Cause I get chills
Downtown and we skip the line
And I watch you dance in the party lights, so fine
Cause you're mine, all mine girl
Cause I get chills, oh woah
Yeah I get chills, oh woah
I get chills
