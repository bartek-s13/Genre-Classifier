A few years ago there lived a lover by the name of Jimmy Jones
Who really snowed the girls and left them cold
And gained the title on the Great Snowman
I remember the day when the snow melted away
And the great snowman was wed
He said yes I do and little Linda siad it too
And the Great Snowman was wed
Now Jimmy Jones was the snowman's name
He put all the other local lovers to shame
He had good looks and a big fine car
And he went around breaking all the girlies' hearts
Until one day the Great Snowman found
Linda Lou started melting him down
He bought the ring and they set the day
And the Great Snowman started melting away
I remember the day...
Now the Great Snowman and his loving spouse
Lived in the little subdivision house
They've got six kids and his mother in law
And expecting another kiddie in the fall
His old Cadillac needs a paint retouched
It's full of baby diaper and bottles and such
The Great Snowman has outgrown
All his flashy cuddy clothes
I remember the day...
