Ol’ 67 Fleetwood sittin’ out in the barn
Transmission shot, but we kept the battery charged
You used to come over and that’s where we’d go
Climb in and play that big four speaker stereo
Sinking deep in the seats of that ol’ Cadillac
Under the spell of that ol’ eight track
You took me to Heaven in nothin’ flat
With Waylon and Willie and a bottle of Jack
Sittin’ up on blocks in our own little world
We’d sit there together just you and me girl
We’d fog up the windows ‘til we couldn’t see out
Finding everything we couldn’t live without
Sinking deep in the seats of that ol’ Cadillac
Under the spell of that ol’ eight track
You took me to Heaven in nothin’ flat
With Waylon and Willie and a bottle of Jack
Sometimes I come out here on a night like tonight
And I picture you smiling in the dashboard lights
It feels like I’m flying but I’m sitting still
I close my eyes and put my hands on the wheel
Sinking deep in the seats of that ol’ Cadillac
Under the spell of that ol’ eight track
You took me to Heaven in nothin’ flat
With Waylon and Willie and a bottle of Jack
We went to Heaven
We went to Texas
We did some livin’ and that’s a fact
With Waylon and Willie and a bottle of Jack
With Waylon and Willie and a bottle of Jack
With Waylon and Willie and a bottle of Jack
