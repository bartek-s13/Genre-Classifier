I haven't stopped thinking about you
Has it really been this long?
Two years and an ocean between us
And I don’t know where it all went wrong
I know I coulda kissed you harder
And yeah, you coulda followed through
Shoulda talked a little bit softer
But we meant every "I love you"

I don't know what this is or what it isn't
But it feels like we’ve got unfinished business

Cause we left blood the on the tracks
Sweat on the saddle
Fire in the hills
A bullet in the barrel
Words never said in a story that didn't end
Looks like you're on the mend and I'm on the bottle
We folded our hands with money on the table
Tried moving on, but I keep coming back again
To what could've been...
What could've been
Oh, what could've been
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
A couple more simple I'm sorrys
A little less tryna be right
I wonder how many good mornings we wasted
’Cause we didn’t say goodnight
One touch before we fell asleep
Just before our love was out of reach
Coulda been enough, coulda saved us from this loneliness

We left blood the on the tracks
Sweat on the saddle
Fire in the hills
A bullet in the barrel
Words never said in a story that didn't end
Looks like you’re on the mend and I'm on the bottle
We folded our hands with money on the table
Tried moving on, but I keep coming back again
To what could've been...
What could've been
Oh, what could’ve been
Oh

I thought I'd see it clearly from a distance
But it still feels like we've got unfinished business
'Cause baby, we left blood the on the tracks
Sweat on the saddle
Fire in the hills
A bullet in the barrel
Words never said in a story that didn't end
Looks like you're on the mend, I'm on the bottle
We folded our hands with money on the table
Tried moving on, but I keep coming back again
Oh, to what could've been
Oh, what could've been
Mmm, what could've been
Shoulda been

Do you still wonder?
Still wonder?
