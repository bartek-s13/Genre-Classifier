When I think of happiness, innocence and truth
In an almost perfect person, that's when I think of you
Now when I say almost perfect, believe me I meant all
Because, my dear, the way I see it, I'm your only flaw

I'm your only imperfection, dust in a diamond
Rust on a heart of gold and the clouds when the sun ain't shinin'
I'm not sure why you love me and I'm not sure what you saw
Because, my dear, the way I see it
I'm your only flaw

When I think of goodness, I think of your smile
It's like having coffee with a friend you ain't seen in a while
When I think of courage, of being brave while feeling small
Baby, I'm not worthy, I'm your only flaw

I'm your only imperfection, dust in a diamond
Rust on a heart of gold and the clouds when the sun ain't shinin'
I'm not sure why you love me and I'm not sure what you saw
Because, my dear, the way I see it
I'm your only flaw
So keep on loving me
So perfectly

I'm your only imperfection, dust in a diamond
Rust on a heart of gold and the clouds when the sun ain't shinin'
I'm not sure why you love me and I'm not sure what you saw
Because, my dear, the way I see it
I'm your only flaw
Yeah, because, my dear, the way I see it
I'm your only flaw

So keep on loving me
