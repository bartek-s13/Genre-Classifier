Sleeping single in a double bed
Thinking over things I wish I'd said
I should've held you, but I let you go
Now I'm the one sleeping all alone.  Oh
Sleeping single in a double bed (Oooh, oooh, oooh.)
Tossing, turning, trying to forget.  (Ah, ah, ah.)
I could be lying with you instead
I'm sleeping single in a double bed
I'd pour me a drink, but I'd only be sorry
'Cause drinking doubles alone don't make it a party
Another sleepless night and it's the same old story
When you're the only one at two in the morning
I'm sleeping single in a double bed (Oooh, oooh, oooh.)
Thinking over things I wish I'd said.  (Ah, ah, ah.)
I should've held you, but I let you go
Now I'm the one sleeping all alone.  Oh
Sleeping single in a double bed  (Oooh, oooh, oooh.)
Tossing, turning, trying to forget.  (You, oooh.)
I could be lying with you instead
I'm sleeping single in a double bed
I'm sleeping single in a double bed (Ah, ah, ah.)
Thinking over things I wish I'd said.  (Oooh, oooh.)
I should've held you, but I let you go
Now I'm the one sleeping all alone.  Oh
Sleeping single in a double bed (Ah, ah, ah.)
Tossing, turning, trying to forget.  (You, oooh.)
I could be lying with you instead
I'm sleeping single in a double bed
I'm sleeping single in a double bed
Thinking over things I wish I'd said
