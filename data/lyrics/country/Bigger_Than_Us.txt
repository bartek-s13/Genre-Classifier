We've been here, we've done that
Saying things we can't take back
Yeah, when times get bad
We get real good at that
Taking stands and starting wars
'Til who knows what we're fighting for
Then it's white flags and unslammed doors
Yeah, I know it's been one of those nights
But it's all going to be alright

Baby, this love is a long, hard highway
Stronger than time and forged in steel
Two driven hearts with a boundless hunger
And crazy's got the wheel
So close your eyes
Let go and hold on tight
Whatever fate throws our way
It's never too much
'Cause girl this love is bigger than us
Bigger than us, bigger than us

Ain't in a thing in this world
That could ever contain it
And no amount of words that could ever explain that
Indescribable, pure unstoppable thing we've got
We've tried every way to mess this up
But it's a lifelong kind of tough

Baby, this love is a long, hard highway
Stronger than time and forged in steel
Two driven hearts with a boundless hunger
And crazy's got the wheel
So close your eyes
Let go and hold on tight
Whatever fate throws our way
It's never too much
'Cause girl this love is bigger than us
Bigger than us, bigger than us
Bigger than us, bigger than us

Hey, we've tried every way to mess this up
But it's a lifelong king of tough

Baby, this love is a long, hard highway
Stronger than time and forged in steel
Two driven hearts with a boundless hunger
And crazy's got the wheel
So close your eyes
Let go and hold on tight
Whatever fate throws our way
It's never too much
'Cause girl this love is bigger than us
Bigger than us, bigger than us
Bigger than us, bigger than us
It's never too much, 'cause girl this love is bigger than us
Bigger than us, bigger than us
