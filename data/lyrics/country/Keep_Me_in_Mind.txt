When everything right seems to go wrong
Your heart wants to sing but it can't find a song
When it seems that the world has left you behind
Keep me in mind
When you think that life is just passing you by
You look but you can't find a reason to try
When it seems that a friend is so hard to find
Keep me in mind
Keep me in mind cause i'll never stop loving you
And as long as i live i'll have love to give
And i'll give it all to you just you
When the dreams that you've chased have all gotten away
And you stand at the end of a long lonely day
You will never be far from these arms of mine
Keep me in mind
When the dreams that you've chased have all gotten away...
