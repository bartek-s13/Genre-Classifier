I can's stand to see a good man go to the waste
One who never combs his hair or shaves his face
A man who leans on wine over love that's told a lie
It tears me up to see a grown man cry

I never go around mirrors
I can't stand to see me without you by my side
I never go around mirrors
'Cause I've got a heartache to hide

And it tears me up to see a grown man cry
