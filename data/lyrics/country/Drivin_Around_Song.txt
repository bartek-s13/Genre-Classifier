Man you ever just wanna, go ridin' around
No worries, well that's this kind of song
Yeah alright

This is for everybody out there, circlin' the town square
Proud to be stuck out in the middle of nowhere
USA, Chevrolet, Dodge and Ford
Raisin' a little hell and praising the Lord (yes sir)
Just simple truth speakin', workin' for the weekend
Every time it hits the fan you just keep on keepin'
You tried and true, red white and blue
Turn it up, turn it up, man, this one’s for you, woo

Hey, this is for the drivin' around
Jack and Diane town, anywhere Saturday night
Yeah, yeah, this is for the back road
Turning up the radio, heading right
Where the two lane turns into Main Street
Cruisin' the same streets
Over in the passenger seat
Baby ain't never looked better just singin' along
To this drivin' around song

Yeah, I know what I’m talkin' about
I grew up in them rural routes
Counting down them days 'til I got brave enough to bust out
City lights in my sights, I’m gonna do it up right
I’m sittin' here with this guitar tonight, alright
Kickin' it in the big town, wishin' I'd a slowed it down
And I give anything if I was drivin' around
With the big dreams in my pocket
Yeah, this is for the ones who don’t know how good they got it

Hey, this is for the drivin' around
Jack and Diane town, anywhere Saturday night
Yeah, yeah, this is for the back road
Turning up the radio, heading right
Where the two lane turns into Main Street
Cruisin' the same streets
Over in the passenger seat
Baby ain't never looked better just singin' along
To this drivin' around song

Alright, everybody
Get in your truck, get in your car, whatever it is, (hey hey hey)
Small town America, baby
We’re goin' drive it around

Hey, this is for the drivin' around
Jack and Diane town, anywhere Saturday night
Yeah, yeah, this is for the back road
Turnin' up the radio, heading right
Where the two lane turns into Main Street, that's right
Cruisin' the same streets
Over in the passenger seat
Baby ain't never looked better just singin' along, just singin' along
To this drivin' around song
Hey, hey this is for the drivin' around, Jack and Diane town
To this drivin' around song
Hey, this is for the drivin' around, Jack and Diane town
To this drivin' around song
