Time has a way
Of wearing on things
Puts another wrinkle on your skin
Another dollar on your overhead
Don't it baby, yeah
[And it don't ever stop
We just try to keep up
Watch another clock, pay another bill
Push another rock up a big ol' hill
Don't we baby, yeah
Sometimes, it feels like a broken record
But baby, you never do

Never gets old watchin' you laugh
Feelin' your kiss, kissin' me back
I never get tired, tired of that
No, it never gets old
It never gets old, holdin' your hand
Gonna stay bein' you man
Lovin' over and over again
No, it never gets old
Might wear me out sometime but it never gets old

Love has a way
Of outlovin' everything
It don't retire, don't move south
Don't expire, 'cause it don't know how
Lucky me, yeah
Sometimes, it feels like we're just twenty-one
And I've barley begun lovin' you

It never gets old watchin' you laugh
Feelin' your kiss, kissin' me back
I never get tired, tired of that
No, it never gets old
It never gets old, seein' you face
Like sunshine and Amazing Grace
Lovin' over and over again
No, it never gets old
Wrap me up in your arms 'cause it never gets old
Wrap me up in your arms 'cause it never gets old
Yeah
