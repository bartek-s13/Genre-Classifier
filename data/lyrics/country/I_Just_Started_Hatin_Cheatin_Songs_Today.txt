Today the midnight oil's all over someone
And those forbidden places aren't forbidden anymore
If my back door could talk, it would tell me
That my borrowed angel's been this far before
I just threw my last bottle at the jukebox
When I heard that woman singing, "Darling, let's go all the way"
And I just found out my woman is the devil
I just started hatin' cheatin' songs today
Did she sleep in your arms last night, mister?
Were you the one who gladly helped her make it through the night?
Did she whisper, "it's not love but it's not bad?"
Did she forget to wake you up to say goodbye?
I just threw my last bottle at the jukebox
When I heard that woman singing, "Darling, let's go all the way"
And I just found out my woman is the devil
I just started hatin' cheatin' songs today
