Could you find me a stamp for this letter
It's important it gets sent today
First-class mail would even be better
'Cause it's for someone who says she can't wait
So I been out runnin' 'round by the water
Just a-jottin' down things I could say
But if I had me a dime I could call her
Oh, and beg her not to leave me this way

Why can't we just hit "Rewind"?
Chalk it up to a hard lesson learned
Time, it flies by in a blink of an eye
And you can't cross a bridge that's been burned

You said you would write me, baby
It's been so long, now
Said you ain't got no money
But if you loved me, you'd find a way how
And I been wanderin' by the water
Wondering what to do
And every step is a step of courage
To free myself from lovin' you
Why can't we just hit "Rewind"?
Chalk it up to a hard lesson learned
Time, it flies by in a blink of an eye
You can't cross a bridge that's been burned


Why can't we just hit "Rewind"?
Chalk it up to a hard lesson learned
Time, it flies by in a blink of an eye
You can't cross a bridge that's been burned

You can't cross a bridge that's been burned
