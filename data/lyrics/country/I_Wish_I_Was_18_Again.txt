On a rig down in Venice, an old hand chimed in
And they thought he was out of his head
And all of the young hands, they just laughed it off
When they heard what this old hand had said
He said, "I'll never again turn the young ladies heads
Or go running off in to the wind
I'm three quarters home from the start to the end
And I wish I was eighteen again"
Oh I wish, I was eighteen again
And going where I've never been
Now old folks and old oaks standing tall just pretend
I wish I was eighteen again
Time turns the pages and life goes so fast
The years turn the black hair all gray
I talk to some young folks but they don't understand
The words this old man got to say
Oh I wish, I was eighteen again
And going where I've never been
Now old folks and old oaks standing tall just pretend
I wish I was eighteen again
Oh I wish I was eighteen again
