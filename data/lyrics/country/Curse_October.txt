I still remember that October day
It was hot like you never liked, the sun beatin' on my face
The doctor told us it'd be the one to take you away
We went to bed that night, knowin' our lives'll change
And I still remember wakin' to the news
Boys your daddy's gone, come say goodbye for good
I cried all my tears, went back to my room
I shut the door hit the floor askin' God why you

Curse October for makin' me grow too fast
Like most things in life the good ones never last
People say he died to young, I can't say I disagree
Curse October for takin' you from me

Never knew depression like I did that year
14 and a lot to learn, wishin' you were here
Just needed to talk for a minute or two
But i couldn't go by that stone it put me in a bad mood

Curse October for makin' me grow too fast
Like most things in life the good ones never last
People say he died to young, I can't say I disagree
Curse October for takin' you from me

Everywhere there's somethin' to remind me of you
Like this truck I drive and to tell you the truth
It gets better everyday
But it's still hard as hell and that's somethin' that won't change

Curse October for makin' me grow too fast
Like most things in life the good ones never last
People say he died to young, I can't say I disagree
Curse October for takin' you from me

Curse October for taking you from me
Yeah curse October for takin'
For takin' you from me
