Let me love you, come close to me
Locked in my arms, you'll still be free
Don't be frightened my high flying bluebird
'Cause my love has no walls
No walls, no ceilings
No walls, no ceilings, no floor
All my love songs are just for you
Sing them with me and when you do
Don't be frightened my high flying bluebird
'Cause my love has no walls
No walls, no ceilings
No walls, no ceilings, no floor
Go on and fly high in the sky
I'll never try to burn your wings
Let me love you, come close to me
Locked in my arms, you'll still be free
Don't be frightened my high flying bluebird
'Cause my love has no walls
No walls, no ceilings
No walls, no ceilings, no floor
