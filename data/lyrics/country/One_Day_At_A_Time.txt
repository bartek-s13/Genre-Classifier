I'm only human I'm just a man
Help me to believe in what I could be and all that I am
Show me the stairway that I have to climb
Lord for my sake teach me to take one day at a time

One day at a time sweet Jesus that's all I'm asking from you
Give me the strength to do everyday what I have to do
Yesterday's gone sweet Jesus and tomorrow may never be mine
So for my sake teach me to take one day at a time

Do you remember when you walked among men
Well Jesus you know if you're looking below it's worse now than then
Pushing and shoving crawding my mind
So for my sake teach me to take one day at a time


Yes, just for my sake teach me to take one day at a time
