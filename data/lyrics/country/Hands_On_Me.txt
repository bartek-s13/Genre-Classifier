I know where I wanna go tonight
Been thinking about it all day
I been waiting on your paradise
I know that you know the way
I let the world outside our window
Do whatever it's gonna do
We'll have a body and soul revival
Right here in this room
When your lips touch mine I'm born again
If I never get to heaven, hell, I've already been
Lead me to salvation, girl, I'm down on my knees
Turn the lights off, slide your jeans off and put your hands on me
Chase your shadow through the secret garden
You'll be waiting for me there, there
I could whisper hallelujah, baby
But I don't have a prayer
And only you can save me
From the crazy that you make me
When your lips touch mine I'm born again
If I never get to heaven, hell, I've already been
Lead me to salvation, girl, I'm down on my knees
Turn the lights off, slide your jeans off and put your hands on me
And only you can save me
From the crazy that you make me
Put your hands on me
Put your hands on me
Hands on me
Put your hands on me
When your lips touch mine I'm born again
If I never get to heaven, hell, I've already been
Lead me to salvation, girl, I'm down on my knees
Turn the lights off, and slide your jeans off and put your hands on me
Turn the lights off, slide your jeans off and put your hands on me
