Baby, I'm in love with you drownin' in your eyes so blue
Tell me that you love me too I'm just gonna be with you
Come and let me hold you hand till I make you understand
I'm just gonna be your man baby I'm in love with you
I'm forever building dreams around your pretty head it seems
Do you want to spoil my dreams and say that you'll ever be mine
I would take an ocean trip just again to hear your sweet lips
I would walk a million miles to hear you say you love me too
I'm forever building dreams around your pretty head it seems
Do you want to spoil my dreams and say that you'll ever be mine
I would take an ocean trip just again to hear your sweet lips
I would walk a million miles to hear you say you love me too
I'll be yours for evermore baby I'm in love with you
