Ain't you even gonna cry
Hey I’m walking out the door
You may never see me many anymore
Ain't you even gonna cry
I've taken all that I can take
My heart’s broke all that a heart can break
I'll be leaving now for my heart’s sake
Staying here would be a big mistake
Ain't you even gonna cry
Hey I’m walking out the door
You may never see me many anymore
Ain't you even gonna cry
I can’t say where I'll be going to
Just someplace to get away from you
All the hurt and pain you put me through
I don’t suppose that I’ll be missed by you
Ain't you even gonna cry
Hey I’m walking out the door
You may never see me many anymore
Ain't you even gonna cry
Ain't you even gonna cry
