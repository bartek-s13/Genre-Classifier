Your bags are packed and waiting
By the door
If you really want to go
Well, it's alright
Don't worry 'bout me darling
Cause I'll get by
But I'll need someone to hold me when I cry
I'll need someone to tell me
That I'll get over you
And I'll need a friend to lean one
When I'm felling blue
So sit down here beside me
After you say good-bye
Cause I'll need someone to hold me when I cry
The taxi cab is waiting
For you to go
But darling, tell him that you've
Changed your mind
And stay until tomorrow
Cause I know tonight
That I'll need someone to hold me when I cry
I'll need someone to tell me
That I'll get over you
And I'll need a friend to lean one
When I'm felling blue
So sit down here beside me
After you say good-bye
Cause I'll need someone to hold me when I cry
And I'll need someone to hold me when I cry
