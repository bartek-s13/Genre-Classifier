You pulled the covers off the bed
Pillow stuck between your legs
Oh, what a beautiful mess
My t-shirts never looked so good
I'm laying here like I could stay here forever next to

Sleeping Beauty
You got no idea what you do to me
I hope your dreams come true
Last night was perfect
We stayed up too late, but it was worth it
To wake up seeing you
Sleeping Beauty

The sun hurts coming through the blinds
I guess I poured us too much wine
Put the blame on me
No I ain't gonna wake you up
You don't need it, but go on
Get your beauty sleep

Sleeping Beauty
You got no idea what you do to me
I hope your dreams come true
Last night was perfect
We stayed up too late, but it was worth it
To wake up seeing you
Sleeping Beauty

Sleeping Beauty
You got no idea what you do to me
I hope your dreams come true
Last night was perfect
We stayed up too late, but it was worth it
To wake up seeing you
Oh, Sleeping Beauty
