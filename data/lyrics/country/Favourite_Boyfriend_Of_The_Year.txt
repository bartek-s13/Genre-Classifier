I'm a little fussy
But I got a little lucky
When the boss from the corner store
He took me out to dinner
And the waiter was a winner
And the boss he was out the door
You're the one who's caught my eye
This could be something worth your while
Hey it's not a waste of time
You're maybe one of many but you will never
Be the last in line
Hey I'm really glad you're here cuz you're one
Of my favourite boyfriends of the year
Now I stole candy from my best friend
Jenny and we never be the same again
Never met a new man and I say how hey
It ended before it began
Don't think I can't make up my mind
Cuz in your arms it feels so right
Hey it's not a waste of time
You're maybe one of many but you will never
Be the last in line
Hey I'm really glad you're here cuz you're one
Of my favourite boyfriends of the year
Well maybe baby you could save me even
Though it's hard you could be my shining
Armour if that's who you are
I've never had it tough cuz I know what it's like
Some variety now and then
Bad boys, good guys, tattoos black ties always up
For anything
Hey it's not a waste of time
You're maybe one of many but you will never
Be the last in line
Hey I'm really glad you're here cuz you're one
Of my favourite boyfriends
One of my favourite boyfriends
You're my favourite boyfriend of the year
I've broken one heart maybe two
I promise I'll be good to you
