I know you're fighting with your mama
I know you're sick of that drama
Yeah, I could pick you up
In a pickup truck, Baby
If you wanna
I got some room in the front seat
Some good tunes with a backbeat
Yeah I know a place girl
Where the troubles of the world
Won't ever find you and me
So let's go
Out where the river runs deep
And the Sycamores grow
Nobody gotta know
If you wanna go crazy
Baby, let's go
To far down a two lane road
Ro-oo-oo-oad
Ro-oo-oo-oad
Ro-oo-oo-oad
Ro-oo-oo-oad
Ro-oo-oo-oad
Ro-oo-oo-oad
We'll need some down south moonlight
With that West Coast Red wine
Yeah, we'll kick it on the hood
Til we're feeling good
Then maybe cross a few tanlines
So let's go
Out where the river runs deep
And the Sycamores grow
Nobody gotta know
If you wanna go crazy
Baby, let's go
To far down a two lane road
Hey girl
When things get a little bit heavy
Get loaded all up in my Chevy
And let it go all out the window
Just say the word and I'm ready
I got an F on the gas gauge
We can take it where the cattle graze
Baby I'm gonna put a smile
Back on your face
Let's go
Out where the river runs deep
And the Sycamores grow
Nobody gotta know
If you wanna go crazy
Baby, let's go
To far down a two lane road
Ro-oo-oo-oad
Ro-oo-oo-oad
Ro-oo-oo-oad
To far down a two lane road
Ro-oo-oo-oad
Ro-oo-oo-oad
Ro-oo-oo-oad
Oh, take it to far with ya baby
Yeah, oo-oo-oo-oo-oh
