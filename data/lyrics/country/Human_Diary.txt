You knew which parts of my body I was insecure about
You knew what I thought about all my friends when they weren't around
You knew which days I was praying, the days that I wasn't
I told you everything
Cause you were my human diary
So when you left, you didn't just leave
No, you took all my secrets with you
You took all my secrets with you
And now you're with someone else
And thinking 'bout it hurts like hell
And you got all my secrets with you
You took all my secrets with you
You knew how to make me weak in a good way and in a bad
You knew the up's and down's in my relationship with my dad
Oh, and damn how I hate it
That you know me naked
I gave you everything
Cause you were my human diary
So when you left, you didn't just leave
No, you took all my secrets with you
You took all my secrets with you
And now you're with someone else
And thinking 'bout it hurts like hell
'Cause you got all my secrets with you
You took all my secrets with you
Now you've got a piece of the secret parts of me
Now all my secrets are in another girl's bed
You were my human diary
So when you left, you didn't just leave
No, you took all my my secrets with you
You took all my secrets with you
Yeah, you took all my secrets with you
You took all my secrets with you, oh
Yeah, you took all my secrets with you
You took all my secrets with you, oh
