He'll be 45 come Wednesday
His gray hair is getting thin
But he's still hanging in there
Don't feel too bad for the shape he's in
He's seen yuppies in the White House
But he thinks they're gonna fail
But he just don't trust the president
That never has inhaled
And he prays to God to stop this crime
But it seems to no avail
Well, he still loves country music
He's been left out in the dark
Cause they don't play Merle and George no more
He don't know Billy Ray from Garth
And he's heard of Woodstock, two
But it never could compete
Cause he was there the day that Hendrix
Played the anthem with his teeth
Back on all those grunge bands
Couldn't even keep a beat
He's an old hippie
Even older than before
Wondering what to pay attention to
And what should he ignore
He's an old hippie
Still adjusting to the change
He's just trying to find some balance
In a world gone totally insane
