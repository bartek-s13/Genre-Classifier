Down in Tennessee I used to sit upon the fence
A-wonderin' about the lack of people's common sense
What I didn't understand then couldn't keep concealed
Was one great big fat watermelon layin' in the field
See that watermelon hangin' on the vine
I wish that watermelon could be mine
The farmer must be careless
Without a lick of sense
Or he wouldn't leave it hangin'
On the vine
Cornbread is sweet
Pork chops are good
Blackeyed peas are mighty, mighty fine
But give me, oh give me
I really wish you would
That watermelon hangin' on the vine
Got a gal who loves me
She always treats me fine
She lets hug and kiss her all the time
I wish that all her kisses
Could taste half as sweet
As the watermelon hangin' on the vine
Oh kissin' is sweet
Huggin' is good
Cherry lips taste mighty, mighty fine
But give me, oh give me
I really wish you would
That watermelon hangin' on the vine
Well I see that watermelon
So thick, so fat, so fine
What a shame to go leavin' it behind
I know my baby's waitin'
She won't be waitin' long
Now that I got that watermelon off the vine
Oh cornbread is sweet
Pork chops are good
Blackeyed peas are mighty, mighty fine
But I ought to tell you
I really think I should
For lickin' good eatin'
Eat a watermelon hangin' on the vine
