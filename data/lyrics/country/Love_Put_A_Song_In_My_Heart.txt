Yes your love put a song, put a song, put a song, in my heart
Never have I had this beautiful feeling before
Yes your love put a song, put a song, put a song, in my
A beautiful song of two people in love evermore

It wasn't too long ago
I thought I would never know
What reason has anyone
To sing a happy song

I knew only loneliness
But then I found happiness
And now I just want to hold
This time and sing along

'Cause your love put a song, put a song, put a song, in my heart
Never have I heard this beautiful music before
Yes your love put a song, put a song, put a song, in my heart
A beautiful song of two people in love evermore

Y tu amor puso una canción en mi corazón
Never have I heard this beautiful music before
Y tu amor puso una canción en mi corazón
A beautiful song of two people in love evermore
Yes your love put a song, put a song, put a song, in my heart
Never have I heard this beautiful music before
Yes your love put a song, put a song, put a song, in my heart
A beautiful song of two people in love evermore
