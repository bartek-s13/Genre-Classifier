Swear one Bud Light sip and I buzz back
One Jack and Diane and I'm in the past
Lost in the middle of seventeen
Yeah everything about you and me

Was a tank of gas and a radio song
Dial to the right and sing along
One bench seat kiss, girl I was gone
Your hand up under my shirt
It still feels like it's right there
Windshield hearts, midnight air
Any good thing, it don't last long
Like a tank of gas and a radio song

I still see your hand out on the wind
That dashboard blue on your skin
That fire, that touch, that wild, that rush
Yeah that was us running down a high
Wish all it took to go back in time

Was a tank of gas and a radio song
Dial to the right and sing along
One bench seat kiss, girl I was gone
Your hand up under my shirt
It still feels like it's right there
Windshield hearts, midnight air
Any good thing, it don't last long
Like a tank of gas and a radio song
That fire, that touch, that wild, that rush
That high that I'm still on
Was a tank of gas and a radio song
Dial to the right and sing along
Was a tank a gas and a radio song

Was a tank of gas and a radio song
Dial to the right and sing along
One bench seat kiss, girl I was gone
Your hand up under my shirt
It still feels like it's right there
Windshield hearts, midnight air
Any good thing, it don't last long
Like a tank of gas and a radio song
Tank of gas and a radio song
Tank of gas and a radio song
