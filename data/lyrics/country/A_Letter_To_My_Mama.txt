Oh, I need to write a letter, put it down in black and white
No, a phone call just won't cut it, not the way I feel tonight
A letter to my mama from the bottom of my heart
"I'm sorry" is a real good place to start

I'm sorry I was selfish, let's chalk it up to youth
I got too old to need you, that's just running from the truth
I'm sorry things didn't work out for you and my old man
Sometimes life don't turn out like you planned

Lookin' back, I wonder how you ever pulled us through
I can't imagine walking in your shoes
If I could stop this pen from shaking, I'd write these words down too
There's no one in this world I love like you

Oh, I've written down the memories of these sixty-some odd years
Trying hard to just say "Thank you" as I wipe away the tears
I hear my grandson calling, so I guess I better go
Could never pay you back the love I owe


Oh, I finished up the letter, put it down in black and white
No, a phone call wouldn't cut it, not the way I feel tonight
A letter to my mama from the bottom of my heart
The very bottom of my heart
