I know I just met you but I can't forget you
I don't want to let you go
Girl there's no pressure, it's just whatever you want
I'll be right here waiting with my mind racing
But either way babe, it's your call

If you want that fire, I'll bring it
If you wanna feel that high, I'll be it
If you want that all night, close your eyes
Baby let's bring it
Yeah but this could be more than only chasing away lonely
More than a one-time, your heart on mine, beating
Take it or leave it
Take it or leave it

There's something about you
And I don't know how to
Say this without sounding crazy
But I'm up on this feeling and all that I'm seeing is us babe

If you want that fire, I'll bring it
If you wanna feel that high, I'll be it
If you want that all night, close your eyes
Baby let's bring it
Yeah but this could be more than only chasing away lonely
More than a one-time, your heart on mine, beating
Take it or leave it
Take it or leave it
If you want that high, we'll light it
If you want that slow, we'll ride it
If you want that all night, yeah you know where to find it

If you want that fire, I'll bring it
If you wanna feel that high, I'll be it
If you want that all night, close your eyes
Baby let's bring it
Yeah but this could be more than only chasing away lonely
More than a one-time, your heart on mine beating
Take it or leave it
Yeah baby, take it or leave it
