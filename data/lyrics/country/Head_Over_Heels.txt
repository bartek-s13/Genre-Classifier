There you go putting that boom-boom
Back in my heart again
Every time you give me that look
Game over I give in
I love the way you get to me
You're like all I ever wanted
Wrapped up in what I need
Hopelessly falling
Tangled and tied
Over the edge
Out of my mind
Spinning in circles
Don't know what you do
I hopelessly helpless
Head over heels over you
There you go burning that fire
Baby in my soul
Your lighter held up high for me
At a sold out show
You're the perfect song so I sing along
And I turn it up loud
And I play it again and again
Hopelessly falling
Tangled and tied
Over the edge
Out of my mind
Spinning in circles
Don't know what you do
I'm hopelessly helpless
Head over heels over you
I'm head over heels over you
Stuck on you girl
That's no line
I couldn't quit you
If I tried
Hopelessly falling
Tangled and tied
Over the edge
And out of my mind
Hopelessly falling
Tangled and tied
Over the edge
Out of my mind
Spinning in circles
Don't know what you do
I'm hopelessly helpless
Head over heels over you
I'm hopelessly helpless
Head over heels over you
I'm hopelessly helpless
Head over heels over you
