We are graffiti on a subway train
Two hands shape of a heart
Lyrics on a Coca-Cola classic can
Promises whispered in the dark
We are Hemingway in a dive bar
I love you in a dead language
Progress running through the telephone wires
Sneakers hangin' by the laces

We are the back roads dirty water soul banks
From the city to the country doing our thing, our way
Say things that I was gonna say
Freedom of our age we are born and raised on American Slang
Born and raise on American Slang, yeah

We are vampires on Hollywood Boulevard
Angels and sinners in our home town streets
An autobiography in a sleeve tattoo
Our broken hearts that still beat

We are the back roads dirty water soul banks
From the city to the country doing our thing, our way
Say things that I was gonna say
Freedom of our age we are born and raised on American Slang
Born and raise on American Slang, yeah

She was Marilyn and Daisy Duke
He was Dean and DiCaprio
Neon turned into LED
Lost boys all came home
Singin'

We are the back roads dirty water soul banks
From the city to the country doing our thing, our way
Say things that I was gonna say
Freedom of our age we are born and raised on American Slang

We are the back roads dirty water soul banks
From the city to the country doing our thing, our way
Say things that I was gonna say
Freedom of our age we are born and raised on American Slang
Born and raise on American Slang
