It's not cool, baby
The way you've been treating me
Playing games for so long
I'm gone, I'll find another guy
You say you're in then out
Leaves a sour taste in my mouth
Every time it gets too much you leave me high and dry

Just when I think I've had enough
Then that bar tender lines them up
One shots, two shots, single malt
You taste better with lime and salt

I like you better when I'm drunk
Better intoxicated
I like you better when I'm drunk
Keep them coming, baby
You're trouble when I'm sober
But tonight you look like fun
Cause I'm drunk

Head hurts, feel rough
Last night had a little too much
I think I called you
Said too much I can't take back
Never again, I don't wanna be your friend
Delete your number
Gotta put you in the past
Just when I think I've had enough
Then that bar tender lines them up
One shots, two shots, single malt
You taste better with lime and salt

I like you better when I'm drunk
Better intoxicated
I like you better when I'm drunk
Keep them coming, baby
You're trouble when I'm sober
But tonight you look like fun
Cause I'm drunk

Just when I think I've had enough
Then that bar tender lines them up
One shots, two shots, single malt
You taste better with lime and salt

I like you better when I'm drunk
Better intoxicated
I like you better when I'm drunk
Keep them coming, baby
Trouble when I'm sober
But tonight you look like fun
Cause I'm drunk
I like you better when I'm drunk
Better when I'm drunk
