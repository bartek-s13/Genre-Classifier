It could be a Monday or a Friday
Or your ex pullin' in to the driveway
Or a hell, might as well, top shelf 'cause you just got paid
It could be a boat on the water
Or a lawn seat sittin' at a concert
Or a settin' sun with your number one on a front porch swing
If you're on the rocks and workin' on a longshot
If it's pregame happy hour in the parking lot

There's a drink for that
Whatever buzz you're chasin'
We're all raisin' up the same glass
Everybody's got their reasons
If you need a cold one or a strong one
Or a pour 'em all night long one
Take a sip of whatever it is wherever you're at, yeah
There's a drink for that
Yeah, yeah
There's a drink for that

It could be a beach chair or a barstool
Or a fake ID, feelin' real cool
Or a summertime all-time high tryna beat the heat (Tryna beat the heat)
If you turn it up tonight or you got no plans
If you've got an empty koozie in your right hand
There's a drink for that
Whatever buzz you're chasin'
We're all raisin' up the same glass
Everybody's got their reasons
If you need a cold one or a strong one
Or a pour 'em all night long one
Take a sip of whatever it is wherever you're at, yeah
There's a drink for that
Yeah, yeah
There's a drink for that

Bourbon, whiskey, wine, or margaritas
If you need a little something then I feel ya

There's a drink for that
Whatever buzz you're chasin'
We're all raisin' up the same glass
Everybody's got their reasons
If you need a cold one or a strong one
Or a pour 'em all night long one
Take a sip of whatever it is wherever you're at, yeah
There's a drink for that
Yeah, yeah
There's a drink for that
Yeah, yeah
There's a drink for that
Yeah, yeah
There's a drink for that
Mmm, there's a drink for that
