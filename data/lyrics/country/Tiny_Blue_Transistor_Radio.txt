(On the tiny blue transistor radio)
He bought it for my birthday just one short year ago
This tiny blue transistor radio (radio radio)
We stayed out late and listened to the music soft and low
On the tiny blue transistor radio
And the man at the radio station made the special dedication
To Jimmy and the girl that he love so
We kissed each other gently as we listened so intently
To the tiny blue transistor radio
And now just one year later his love for me is gone
He's out tonight with his new love I know (I know I know)
And I just heard them playin' the one we called our song
On the tiny blue transistor radio
And the man at the radio station made the special dedication
To Jimmy and the girl that he love so
Her happy eyes are glisnin' while my sad heart is listenin'
To the tiny blue transistor radio my tiny blue transistor radio
