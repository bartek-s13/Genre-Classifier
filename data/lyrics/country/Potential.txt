If you just grew up a little more than
You know that you'd be perfect, you'd be perfect
If you just tried harder like I know you could then
You know that it'd be worth it, it'd be worth it

I could tell myself that you'll get there, you'll get there
But the more that you don't, the less blind I am
I could tell myself that you'll get there, hang in there
But honestly now, I'm beginning to understand

That I'm not in love with you
I'm not in love with you
I'm in love with your potential
I'm in love with your potential

I get fed up and then you show up
You act like I'm so perfect, I'm so perfect
A shot of stronger keeps me longer
And I hope that, I hope it's worth it, I hope it's worth it

I could tell myself that you'll get there, you'll get there
But the more that you don't, the less blind I am
I could tell myself that you'll get there, hang in there
You'll get there (hang in there)

But I'm not in love with you
I'm not in love with you
I'm in love with your potential
I'm in love with your potential

Yeah, you are is who you are
And it's alright, but it's not right for me
No
Maybe one day, but it's too late
And I can't wait, but I can't wait to see
No

I'm not in love with you

No, I'm not in love with you
I'm not in love with you
I'm in love with your potential
I'm in love with your potential

I'm not in love with you
I'm not in love with you
I'm in love with your potential
I'm in love with your potential
