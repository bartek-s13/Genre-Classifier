Girl I knew it must be you
'Cause it got hotter in this room
You walked in, made heads spin
You look so good in the neon light
I drink you in with thirsty eyes
Long sip of your cool smile
Girl, I wanna reach right out
Wrap you in my arms right now
Never let go, never let go
'Cause I just gotta taste you, baby
You know it drives me crazy
To be so far away
When your lips are so close
When your lips are so close
You might be right next to me
But, girl, it feels like miles between
My hands and your skin
You know what I'm thinking of
Small talk just won't be enough
Can't wait for your touch
Girl, I wanna reach right out
Wrap you in my arms right now
Never let go, never let go
'Cause I just gotta taste you, baby
You know it drives me crazy
To be so far away
When your lips are so close
When your lips are so close
Instrumental Bridge
Girl, I wanna reach right out
Wrap you in my arms right now
Never let go, never let go
'Cause I just gotta taste you, baby
You know it drives me crazy
To be so far away
When your lips are so close
When your lips are so close
When your lips are so close
When your lips are so close
Lips are so close
Lips are so close
