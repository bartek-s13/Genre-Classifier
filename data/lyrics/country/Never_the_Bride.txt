?
Everybody tells me i gotta try harder
If i want to find the perfect partner
But i attract the type
That my momma don't like
Am i supposed to follow
Never the bride, always the bridesmaid
Don’t try to have it all my way
These lights, are too bright
Take the big ol' spot light off my face
And i'll shine right on the back seat
And i like, cruisin’ the side streets
I don't mind it i'm
Never the bride, always the bridesmaid
Always the bridesmaid
All i've ever known is second hand dresses
Hand me down shoes i never made the distance
Never had nothing new
Cause i didn't have to
Every single time that the bouquet's flying
The girls go wild and i go hiding
I sneak out the back
I never wanted that
Never the bride, always the bridesmaid
Don't try to have it all my way
These lights, are too bright
Take the big ol' spot light off my face
And i’ll shine right on the back seat
And i like, cruisin’ the side streets
I don't mind it i’m
Never the bride, always the bridesmaid
Always the bridesmaid
Always the bridesmaid
Am i supposed to follow yeah
I was never one to follow
Never the bride, always the bridesmaid
Don't try to have it all my way
These lights, are too bright
Take the big ol' spot light off my face
And i'll shine right on the back seat
And i like, cruisin’ the side streets
I don't mind it i'm
Never the bride, always the bridesmaid
Always the bridesmaid
Never the bride
Always the bridesmaid
Always the bridesmaid
