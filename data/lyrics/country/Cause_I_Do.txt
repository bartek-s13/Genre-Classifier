Do you ever get lost in your thoughts
When somebody's tryna talk to ya?
And do ya
Ever fall asleep sitting on the couch
'Cause cold leather just feels better now?
Do ya? Do ya?

Do you miss your exit on the way home
When our song's playing on the radio
And you've got nowhere else to be?

'Cause I do when I think of you
Does it ever cross your mind?
Do you ever wonder why I'm not holding you?
'Cause I do

Do you fall all over again
When a stranger's wearing the same scent that I do?
'Cause I do
Do you find a way just to bring me up?
In every conversation just because
You're caught up in what used to be

'Cause I do when I think of you
Does it ever cross your mind?
Do you ever wonder why I'm not holding you?
'Cause I do


'Cause I do, woah
'Cause I do when I think about you
Does it ever cross your mind? (Cross your mind)
Do you ever wonder why (wonder why)?
I'm not holding you
'Cause I do
