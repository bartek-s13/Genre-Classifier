Been my friends all day
It's no good I'm still lonely
Seems that I just can't forget
My one and only
So there's just one thing left to do
If I intend to sleep tonight
Put the bottle on the bar
And let me do it up right
Please put the bottle on the bar
Where I can pet it
And take my address down
Before I forget it
I've got a feeling someone's
Gonna have to take me home this time
Cause I'm gonna sit here
Till I get her off of my mind
My baby's gone gone gone
And I'm alone so so alone
And I've got nothing else to lose
So bartender pass the booze
Please put the bottle on the bar
Where I can pet it
And take my address down
Before I forget it
I've got a feeling someone's
Gonna have to take me home this time
Cause I'm gonna sit here
Till I get her off of my mind
My baby's gone gone gone
And I'm alone so so alone
And I've got nothing else to lose
So bartender pass the booze
