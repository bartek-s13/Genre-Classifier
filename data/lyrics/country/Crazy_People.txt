Daddy rolling through a four-way
Mama singing to a hymnal
Wood-paneled family car
My nose up against the window
Flashing neon beer sign
People all around
Mom said don't pay them no mind
That ain't your kinda crowd

Needing saving
Late-night chasing
Wrong side of the tracks
Lost inhibitions
Strangers kissing
Smoking out the back
Backseat loving
Fighting, cussing
Music way too loud
Bunch of heart-breaking
Money-wasting
Hell-raising
Crazy people

I found an old shoebox I wasn't supposed to find
Had written right on top "Summer '75"
Saw Mama in a two-piece hanging off a lifeguard stand
Daddy right beside her with a cold one in his hand
Needing saving
Late-night chasing
Wrong side of the tracks
Lost inhibitions
Strangers kissing
Smoking out the back
Backseat loving
Fighting, cussing
Music way too loud
Bunch of heart-breaking
Money-wasting
Hell-raising
Crazy people
