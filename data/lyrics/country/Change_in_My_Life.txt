Standing cold and scared on top of Blue Hill
There came one moment when I lost my will
I prayed for mercy, Please, Lord take me away
Or give me sunshine where I only see grey
The past had a hold on me, it can't be denied
And the changes didn't come easily

I've been lonely, I've been cheated, I've been misunderstood;
I've been washed up, I've been put down, and told I'm no good
But with you I belong, 'cause you helped me be strong
There's a change in my life since you came along
Now I don't mind working so hard every day
And I don't pay no mind to what people say. No, no
Cause after all the pain I've been through
I'd give up everything just to love only you
All my life I've held my head bent in shame
But now I've found you, and with you I'll remain
Don't you know

Now a man gets crazy when his life is all wrong
And a heart gets weary when it doesn't belong
When the road gets rocky, Lord, you've got to keep on
Let the new light come shining on through

Can you see it (I can see this love forever)
Can you hear it (I hear it in my heart)
Can you feel it (feel the power around me)
There's a change in my life since you came along
Don't you know
