When I was younger I'd struggle at times
To get out of bed and at night to unwind
A dear friend of mine gave me some advice
Drink coffee in the mornin' and whiskey at night

Whiskey can turn a bad day to flowers
Be a source of courage when you'd rather coward
And coffee exposes a bed full of roses
When you can't seem to do nothin' right
It's coffee in the mornin' and whiskey at night

And as I got older I'd fuss and I'd fight
That whiskey will kill ya, I said "Hey man yeah right"
To get rid of those headaches I had to oblige
In coffee in the mornin' and whiskey at night

Whiskey can turn a bad day to flowers
Be a source of courage when you'd rather coward
And coffee exposes a bed full of roses
When you can't seem to do nothin' right
It's coffee in the mornin' and whiskey at night

Now I lay dyin' it's the end of my life
At the foot of my bed a preacher reads me my rights
I sit up and ask him "Hey what's heaven like?"
"Well there's coffee in the mornin' and whiskey at night"

Whiskey can turn a bad day to flowers
Be a source of courage when you'd rather coward
And coffee exposes a bed full of roses
When you can't seem to do nothin' right
It's coffee in the mornin' and whiskey at night
