Don't forget me little darling while I'm growing old and gray
Just a little thought before I'm going far away
Cause I'll be waiting on the hillside for the day you will call
On the sunny side of the mountain where the rippling waters fall
Now darling, tell me in your letters do you ever think of me
Ah, tell me ... little darling tell me where you can be
Don't forget about the days we courted many years ago
Don't forget all those promises you gave me and so
It's been so long since I've seen you but your love still lingers on
Don't forget me little darling though our love affair gone
