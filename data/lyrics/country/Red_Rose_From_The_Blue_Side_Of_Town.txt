When the man from the flower-shop rings your doorbell today
Take the red rose with the ribbon of blue
You'll find a million memories you threw away
In this red rose I'm sending to you
It's just a red rose from the blue side of town
From a lonely man you left down
I'm sending it from my world that new world you found
It's just a red rose from the blue side of town
( steel )
My red rose may not decorate your mansion on the hill
With your pretty flowers all around
But a thousand roses in your garden can't express the love
That's in this red rose I'm sending to you
It's just a red rose from the blue side of town...
