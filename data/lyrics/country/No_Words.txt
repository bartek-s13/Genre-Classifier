My whole view of the word has changed
I guess that comes with age
I don't believe there is good in every man
Like I did back then
I may drink more than I should
You've seen me on the floor
I've spent my lifetime in this cage
I built around me
Bangin' on the doors
And no words
Could ever say how much I need you
With you here
You make this life I lead worth living
Heaven knows I broke your heart
I can't take that away
All I'm worth is
Just this promise that I've made to you
To stand beside you
Just like you have stood beside me
And no words
Could ever say how much I need you
With you here
You make this life I lead worth living
You could be much better off
God knows without me
And thats why
I just can't find the words
You could be much better off
God Knows without me
And thats why
I just can't find the words
