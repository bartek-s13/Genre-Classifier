I was feelin' lonely
And I was new in town
I was only lookin' for a friend
But when the music started
And I saw you in the crowd
My heart just opened up and let you in
Oh I just came here to dance
I didn't want a lover
I just came here to dance
And look what I discovered
I was caught up in the music
And I was captured
By the magic in your eyes
I wasn't lookin' for romance
I just came here to dance
I may be actin' crazy
And maybe I'm insane
To lose my heart so easily
But when we started dancin'
And you held me in your arms
I don't know what came over me
Oh I just came here to dance
I didn't want a lover
I just came here to dance
And look what I discovered
I was caught up in the music
And I was captured by the magic
In your eyes
I wasn't lookin' for romance
I just came here to dance
Oh, it felt so right
With the jukebox lights
Spinnin' 'round and 'round
When the night was through
It was me and you
And a new love we'd found
