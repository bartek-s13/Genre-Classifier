Man I swear some days I can't catch a break
Sometimes it's all too much to take
Man it feels just like I'm going off the tracks
She calls me up and brings me back

Every time that girl talks, girl talks
It takes the weight right off my chest
I could get so lost, so lost
In anything she says
No there ain't a drink, there ain't a drug
That can do what she does
When this crazy world is spinning out of control
It stops every time that girl talks, girl talks

I don't know how she does it but she does it
She knows all the words that turn my worries into nothin
When it feels just like I'm going off the tracks
She calls me up and just like that

Every time that girl talks, girl talks
It takes the weight right off my chest
I could get so lost, so lost
In anything she says
No there ain't a drink, there ain't a drug
That can do what she does
When this crazy world is spinning out of control
It stops every time that girl talks, girl talks
Every time that girl talks, girl talks
I could get so lost, so lost

Every time that girl talks, girl talks
It takes the weight right off my chest
I could get so lost, so lost
In anything she says
No there ain't a drink, there ain't a drug
That can do what she does
When this crazy world is spinning out of control
It stops every time that girl talks, girl talks
Every time that girl talks, girl talks
Every time that girl talks, girl talks
Every time that girl talks, girl talks
