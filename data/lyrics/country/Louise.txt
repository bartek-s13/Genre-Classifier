Me and Louise never had much luck
Just a couple of kids with a lot of love
Laid our fortunes on her daddy's old farm
Didn't see how dirt could do such harm
Seasons came and the seasons left
The only thing that changed was the shape of her dress
She said: you're a good man, you'll have my child
You can't raise a living a thing on this cursëd old ground
We laid a sheet on the piano keys
Crying good lord, please, please
Packed our things into the old farm car
Wondering if it could take us very far
And I said
Everything about it takes a little luck
Gears rumble - and the left door's stuck
It doesn't come with any guarantees
But there's gas in the tank, Louise
Out here on the borderline the sun sets low
Like a couple of jackrabbits dancing in the morning snow
Knew we'd make it, if we could just get out
The only thing we saw was love in sow
Miles came and the miles went
Our hearts full - our money spent
Somewhere outside El Paso my Louise cried out
She took my arm - said, "It's time now"
I prayed and waited all night
Oh Louise, please, please
I heard a new voice with the new day
I thought back to what her Daddy used to say
And he said
Everything about it takes a little luck
Gears rumble - and the left door's stuck
It doesn't come with any guarantees
But there's gas in the tank, Louise

Then me and Louise didn't go too far
We named our boy for Louise's pa
Found a plot of ground we could call our own
We built a house - we built a home
And we said
Everything about it takes a little luck
Gears rumble - and the left door's stuck
It doesn't come with any guarantees
But there's gas in the tank, Louise
But there's gas in the tank
But there's gas in the tank
But there's gas in the tank
Louise
