Well I'll admit that there've been lots of pretty girls I've known
There've been lots of Flosie Mae's and Mary Jane's
But there's one that stands out above the others
Oh I'll never forget ol' what's her name
Time can never drive her from my memory
No one else could ever mean so much to me
And ever since she went away my life ain't been the same
Oh I'll never forget ol' what's her name
When my old friends ask me what happened to her
I just smile and say I forgot her name
But deep inside I know they can't feel the pain
And I'll never forget ol' what's her name
Time can never drive her from my memory...
