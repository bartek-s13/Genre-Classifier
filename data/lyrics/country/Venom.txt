Her house is covered in plastic
And I doubt I'll ever be back here
When the lights go out and things are falling down
I hope she'll notice

'Cuz I won't bend until I break
Just bite my tongue and walk away

'Cuz she's no Cinderella
And that ain't no castle of gold
I shoulda known better
But I guess I was wrong
Anthrax love letters
A hand gun wrapped in a bow
That girl is venom
That girl is venom
That girl is venom

Her force is stronger than magic
You'll forfeit under her mattress
And then the lights go down but you won't figure out
Where it's all goin'
'Til it's unfoldin'

She'll bend you until you break
And glass slippers ain't her taste

'Cuz she's no Cinderella
And that ain't no castle of gold
I shoulda known better
But I guess I was wrong
Anthrax love letters
A hand gun wrapped in a bow
That girl is venom
That girl is venom
That girl is venom

She's so drop dead beautiful
A piece of charcoal painted gold
Yet she still seems to have a hold
A splinter in my soul

'Cuz she's no Cinderella
And that ain't no castle of gold
I shoulda known better
But I guess I was wrong
Anthrax love letters
A handgun wrapped in a bow
That girl is venom
That girl is venom
