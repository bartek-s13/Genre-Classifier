With an empty glass and a last cigarette
Closin' time and I'm drunk again
But somehow I'll make it home and cry myself to sleep
And that's the way the day ends every night for me

Every night, I'm in some bar
I'm throwin' whiskey on a heart that's on fire
Forgettin' you ain't no easy thing
And each night for me ends up the same

With an empty glass and a last cigarette
It's closin' time, I'm drunk again
Somehow I'll make it home, cry myself to sleep
And that's the way the day ends every night for me

Every night, I'm in some bar
I'm throwin' whiskey on a heart that's on fire
Forgettin' you ain't no easy thing
And each night for me ends up the same

With an empty glass and a last cigarette
It's closin' time and I'm drunk again
But somehow I'll make it home, cry myself to sleep
And that's the way the day ends every night for me
And that's the way the day ends every night for me
