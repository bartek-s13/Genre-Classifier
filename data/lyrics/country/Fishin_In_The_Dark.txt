Lazy yellow moon comin' up tonite
Shinin' thru the trees
Crickets are singin' and lightning bugs
Are floatin' on the breeze
Baby get ready
Across the field where the creek turns back by the ole stone road
I'm gonna take you to a special place that nobody knows
Baby get ready
Ooh, oh

You and me going fishing in the dark
Lying on our backs and counting the stars
Where the cool grass grows
Down by the river in the full moon light
We'll be fallin' in love in the middle of the night
Just movin' slow
Stayin' the whole night thru, feels so good to be with you

Spring is almost over and the summer's comin'
The days are gettin' long
Waited all winter for the time to be right, just to take you along
Baby get ready
And it don't matter if we sit forever and the fish don't bite
Jump in the river and cool ourselves from the heat of the night
Baby get ready
Ooh, oh
You and me going fishing in the dark
Lying on our backs and counting the stars
Where the cool grass grows
Down by the river in the full moon light
We'll be fallin' in love in the middle of the night
Just movin' slow
Stayin' the whole night thru, feels so good to be with
You and me going fishing in the dark
Lying on our backs and counting the stars
Where the cool grass grows
Down by the river in the full moon light
We'll be fallin' in love in the middle of the night
Just movin' slow
You and me going fishing in the dark
Lying on our backs and counting the stars
Where the cool grass grows
Down by the river in the full moon light
We'll be fallin' in love in the middle of the night
