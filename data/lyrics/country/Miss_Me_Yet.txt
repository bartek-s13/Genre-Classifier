I'm on a boat somewhere
Somewhere south
Anchored down about 20 miles out
10 tan toes propped in the air
I got a drink in my hand
Water's waving, seagulls sailing
Right across a big breathtaking red sunset
Miss me yet?
I always said if you would ever break my heart, you would never see me again
I'd get outta here and disappear, take my heart where the coast is clear and just be gone with the wind
And I'd get so far away from you, you would never see
How easy or how hard it'd be for me to forget, miss me yet?
I've been reeling them in
I've been catching all day be catching all night
Yeah, they're out here, I hook them every time, but I throw 'em back in
Cause I only ever wanted one
So here I am, in paradise
Living ocean wide open no land in sight
This is as good as it gets, yeah, miss me yet?
I always said if you would ever break my heart, you would never see me again
I'd get outta here and disappear, take my heart where the coast is clear and just be gone with the wind
I'd get so far away from you, you would never see
How easy or how hard it'd be for me to forget, miss me yet?
Miss me yet?
Well, I always said if you'd ever break my heart, you would never see me again
I'd get outta here and disappear, take my heart where the coast is clear and just be gone with the wind
And I'd get so far away from you, you would never see
How easy or how hard it'd be for me to forget, miss me yet?
