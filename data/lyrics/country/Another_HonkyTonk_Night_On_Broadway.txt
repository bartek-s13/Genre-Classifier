I sold my horse and saddle
Rode the Greydog to New
My guitar and 50 dollars
Between bein all alone
Found a job that pays ok
But it costs twice as much to stay
So I'll just buy myself a beer and dream of home
When things ain't going good
That's when everything goes bad
But this old bar's my home away from home
I won't worry about tomorrow
'cause tonight I'll drown my sorrow
Think about that sweet thang back in San Antoine
I'm hangin' in by hangin' out
'til I drink the night away
'til I find my name in neon lights
I guess I'm gonna have to stay
But I'm tired of sleepin' all alone
My arms can reach to San Antoine
So tonight'll be another honky tonk night on broadway
When all that's on my mind is the love you left behind
That's when honkin' tonkin' helps to ease the pain
And you know that I get lonesome too
But these cowboys know I belong to you
And I'm waitin' 'til I'm in your arms again
I'm hangin' in by hangin' out
'til I drink the night away
'til you find your name in neon lights
I guess you're gonna have to stay
I'm so tired of sleepin' all alone
My arms can reach to San Antoine
So tonight'll be another honky tonk night on broadway
I'm hangin' in by hangin' out
'til I drink the night away
'til you find your name in neon lights
I guess you're gonna have to stay
I'm so tired of sleepin' all alone
My arms can reach to San Antoine
So tonight'll be another honky tonk night on broadway
