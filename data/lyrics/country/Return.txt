Home
I’m ready to follow
Devoted to the life I watched you lead
Home
So far from sorrow
Where everything you love’s within your reach
Returning to a love that was returned to me
Returning to a love that was returned to me
Home
I’ll be there tomorrow
To the place where distance and the longing touch
You
You’re the only reason that I go
To remind me of the roots that I’ve grown from
Returning to a love that was returned to me
Returning to a love that was returned to me
Past to the beginning that I don’t deserve
Arms wrapped around me when there are no words
Returning to a love that was returned to me
Home
Where the door is wide open
And the last thing you ever have me do is leave
Home
Where everything you’re holding
Becomes the true convictions you believe
Returning to a love that was returned to me
Returning to a love that was returned to me
Passing out a gift that I don’t deserve
Arms wrapped around me when there are no words
Returning to a love that was returned
Returning to a love that was returned to me
Returning to a love that was returned to me
Passing out a gift that I don’t deserve
Arms wrapped around me when there are no words
Returning to a love that was returned
Returning to a love that was returned
To me
