I ain't even gonna ask you
I can read you like a book
Girl, if I ever saw one that's an
I can't believe I did that look
You look like something
That the cat drug in
So I won't kick you while you're down
Just let me tell you, friend to friend
About a block I've been around
Did you really think last night
Would last forever
Did you really think that guy
Hung the moon
Right now, you hate yourself
Cuz you knew better
But there's no use crying
Over spilled perfume
There's a big difference
Between lonely and
Lonely for way too long
And I knew when he made his move
You weren't feeling all that strong
So I bit my tongue
Cuz I saw it coming
She danced so close to him
It's two steps forward and three steps back
When a heart is on the mend
Did you really think last night
Would last forever
Did you really think that guy
Hung the moon
Right now, you hate yourself
Cuz you knew better
But there's no use crying
Over spilled perfume
You fell in a moment of weakness
When, you've just gotta
Pull yourself back up
Dry your morning-after tears
Cuz what's done is done
Did you really think last night
Would last forever
Did you really think that guy
Hung the moon
Right now, you hate yourself
Cuz you knew better
But there's no use crying
Over spilled perfume
No use crying over
No use crying over
No use crying over spilled perfume
