I knew before I met ya
I wanted an up-all-night kinda crazy
Girl, right when I met ya
Yeah, your eyes on mine said the same thing

And I knew I wanted falling fast, taking that chance you and me
Taking on the time of our lives
So why don't we collide for the first time tonight?

You know you wanna
Kick back, relax, slip in at 2AM
Talk the talk, 'til the sun's coming up again
Nowhere to go so they can't shut us down
So why don't we right now
Just find a little, lean back and make it up
While the stars are watching us
Kissing in the back of that little red Corvette
Prince song I'll turn it up
Start with that get to know ya
Show ya what I wanna show ya
I'll put that feeling on ya
Girl you know you wanna
You know you wanna

You know you wanna hide out
Way back on a spot that ain't tracked on a map
Left and right, we'll slow down
You lookin' like that with my hat turned to the back

You got me falling fast, taking that chance you and me
Taking on the chance of our lives
The time is right now, for you and I

You know you wanna
Kick back, relax, slip in at 2AM
Talk the talk, 'til the sun's coming up again
Nowhere to go so they can't shut us down
So why don't we right now
Just find a little, lean back and make it up
While the stars are watching us
Kissing in the back of that little red Corvette
Prince song I'll turn it up
Start with that get to know ya
Show ya what I wanna show ya
I'll put that feeling on ya
Girl you know you wanna
You know you wanna

You know you wanna
Stay until they're all gone
You know you wanna
Go as far as we can go

You know you wanna
Kick back, relax, slip in at 2AM
Talk the talk, 'til the sun's coming up again
Nowhere to go so they can't shut us down
Just find a little, lean back and make it up
While the stars are watching us
Kissing in the back of that little red Corvette
Prince song I'll turn it up
Start with that get to know ya
Show ya what I wanna show ya
I'll put that feeling on ya
Girl you know you wanna
You know you wanna

You know you wanna
Stay until they're all gone
You know you wanna
Go as far as we can go
You know you wanna
You know you wanna
