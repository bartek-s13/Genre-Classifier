Last night I told a lie
When I told you I could say goodbye
Here in the light of day
What a crazy thing for me to say

What I meant to say was I love you
What's been killin' me is I hurt you
What I didn't do was hold you
When I saw the teardrops fall
What I should have said was I'm sorry
What I should have said was forgive me
What I meant to say was
What I didn't say at all

Last night I had a dream
You were really walkin' out on me
I woke up scared to death
Please forget about the things I said

What I meant to say was I love you
What's been killin' me is I hurt you
What I didn't do was hold you
When I saw the teardrops fall
What I should have said was I'm sorry
What I should have said was forgive me
What I meant to say was
What I didn't say at all
