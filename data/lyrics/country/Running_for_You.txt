We had a good run
But I knew, I knew, I knew
I knew this day would come
As bad as I want to
Ain't no way, not me girl
I ain't gonna stop you

But if the rain starts falling, falling on you
And your heart starts breaking, breaking in two
If the light starts fading, baby don't move
Just say my name, stay right there
I'll come running for you

I'm gonna miss you
Baby there's no way that I can go with you
So go on and chase it
I know, I know, I know
You can almost taste it
Yeah, time's a wastin'

But if the rain starts falling, falling on you
And your heart starts breaking, breaking in two
If the light starts fading, baby don't move
Just say my name, stay right there
I'll come running for you
Yeah, ooh

It's gonna be a long night
And I might shed a tear
But I'll a be all right
And even though you won't be in my arms
You'll be right where you belong
So go girl, go girl, go on

But if the rain starts falling, falling on you
And your heart starts breaking, breaking in two
If the light starts fading, baby don’t move
Just say my name, stay right there
I’ll come running for you, yeah
