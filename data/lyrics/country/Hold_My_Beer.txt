I've been watching you watchin' every girl in the bar
And payin' no attention to the one on your arm
You're a dog
And man she's smokin'
I've seen your kind before
You think you're so cool
This country boy's gonna take you to school
Hold out your hand
No man I ain't jokin'
And hold my beer
While I kiss your girlfriend
Cause she needs a real man
And not a boy like you
Hold my beer
Yeah I'm a man on a mission
You don't see what you're missin'
But I do so here
Hold my beer
Well friend I wouldn't blame you
If you wanted to fight
If you wanna later we can take it outside
But for now
Do me a favour yeah
And hold my beer
While I kiss your girlfriend
Cause she needs a real man
And not a boy like you
Hold my beer
Yeah I'm a man on a mission
You don't see what you're missin'
But I do so here
Hold my beer
Well guys like you
You ain't good for nothin' no
Hold on a second
You gotta be good for somethin'
For somethin'
I know
Hold my beer
While I kiss your girlfriend
Cause she needs a real man
And not a chump like you
Hold my beer
Yeah I'm a man on a mission
You don't see what you're missin'
But I do so here
Hold my beer
Hold my beer
Hold my beer
Hold my beer
But don't drop it (Hold my beer)
Naw seriously man don't drop it
(Hold my beer)
Cause I-I-I just bought it (hold my beer)
You gonna be hangin' around here a while
You wanna watch my jacket? (hold my beer)
Aw thanks man, I'm gonna be out here dancin'
With-with your girlfriend (hold my beer)
Hold my beer
Hold my beer
Hold my beer
