I wish you love and happiness
I guess I wish you all the best
I wish you don't do like I do
And never fall in love with someone like you
Cause if you fell just like I did
You'd probably walk around the block like a little kid
But kids don't know; they can only guess
How hard it is to wish you happiness
I guess that love is like a Christmas card
You decorate a tree,you throw it in the yard
It decays and dies, and the snowmen melt
Well, I once knew love; I knew how love felt
Yeah I knew love; love knew me
And when I walked, love walked with me
And I got no hate, and I got no pride
Well, I got so much love that I cannot hide
Yeah, I got so much love that I cannot hide
Say you drive a Chevy, say you drive a Ford
Say you drive around the town 'till you just get bored
Then you change you mind for something else to do
And your heart gets bored with your mind and it changes you
Well it's a doggone shame, and it's an awful mess
I wish you love; I wish you happiness
I wish you love; I wish you happiness
I guess I wish you all the best
