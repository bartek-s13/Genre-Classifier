Could be the summer night
Could be that song that just came on
Could be that clock striking midnight
Hitting me strong
Could be this first half of the third glass
On the last night of the week
Hell, I don't know
I don't know

Might be good timing
May be those stars are all lined up
But I caught you smiling
Can't put my finger on it
You've got something like nothing I've ever seen
Maybe it's just me
Naw, it ain't just just me girl

You don't even know, know
The way you walk, I walk
The way you move, move
Don't you know you're lighting up the room, room
All I see is you
From the second you walked in, keep doing what you're doing
'Cause girl it's working
From second you walked in, from the second you walked in
Girl it's working
Keep doing what you're doing now, keep doing what you're doing 'Cause girl it's working
Wanna see you in the moonlight
Wanna get you out of here, get to making you all mine
Yeah, it's feeling like a sure thing
Keep doing what you're doing
'Cause girl it's working
Might be those Levi's
Or that rock 'n' roll t-shirt
But you're doing something right
Yeah girl, there ain't no words
The way that you're dancing, I can't dance around it
So baby how 'bout it

You don't even know, know
The way you walk, I walk
The way you move, move
Don't you know you're lighting up the room, room
All I see is you
From the second you walked in, keep doing what you're doing
'Cause girl it's working
From second you walked in, from the second you walked in
Girl it's working
Keep doing what you're doing now, keep doing what you're doing 'Cause girl it's working
Wanna see you in the moonlight
Wanna get you out of here, get to making you all mine
Yeah, it's feeling like a sure thing
Keep doing what you're doing
'Cause girl it's working

You don't even know, know
The way you walk, I walk
The way you move, move
Don't you know you're lighting up the room, room
All I see is you
From the second you walked in, keep doing what you're doing
'Cause girl it's working
From second you walked in, from the second you walked in
Girl it's working
Keep doing what you're doing now, keep doing what you're doing 'Cause girl it's working
Wanna see you in the moonlight
Wanna get you out of here, get to making you all mine
Yeah, it's feeling like a sure thing
Keep doing what you're doing
'Cause girl it's working
Oh yeah, girl it's working
Yeah girl, it's working
