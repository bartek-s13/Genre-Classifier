I brought flowers to your door last night
I done wrong and I wanna make it right
You say I'm not welcome here
I know it oughta be perfectly clear
But I can't help but wonder what it might be like

If I had two dozen roses
And an old bottle of wine
If I really coulda hung the moon
Would you change your mind
If I could try a little harder
And get a little less sleep at night
If I had two dozen roses would it change your mind
Oh I must have been a fool back then
To lose something that you can't have again
I've done all that I know to do
Second guessed my every move
But I can't help but wonder how it might have been

If I had two dozen roses
And an old bottle of wine
If I really coulda hung the moon
Would you change your mind
If I could try a little harder
And get a little less sleep at night
If I had two dozen roses would it change your mind
If I could try a little harder
And get a little less sleep at night
If I had two dozen roses would it change your mind
Baby could you change your mind
Oh baby would you change your mind
Oh baby would you change your mind
