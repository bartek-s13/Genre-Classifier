I can hear the train pushing through the snow
Over the mighty missipi roads
The squeaking of the steel
Don't care how I feel
Or If I'm ready to go

So, I close my eyes and I start to dream
I throw a nickel in the time machine
Until I taste the wine
Feel your hand in mine
But this time no one's there

I wish I'd known
But nobody told me
That was the last time you were ever gonna hold me
Maybe I'd a held on a little bit longer
Like I was never gonna let you go
Oh
I wish I'd known
I wish I'd known

Wouldn't wait a little longer in your bed
Held on tighter to the words you said
Slowly falling out of your beautiful mouth
Where's the time that we had lost?
I wish I'd known
But nobody told me
That was the last time you were ever gonna hold me
Maybe I'd a held on a little bit longer
Like I was never gonna let you go
Oh
I wish I'd known
I wish I'd known
Oo, I wish I'd known

And I can hear the train pushing through the snow
But I'm not ready to go

I wish I'd known
But nobody told me
That was the last time you were ever gonna hold me
Maybe I'd a held on a little bit longer
Like I was never gonna let you go

I wish I'd known
But nobody told me
That was the last time you were ever gonna hold me
Maybe I'd a held on a little bit longer
Like I was never gonna let you go
Oh
I wish I'd known
I wish I'd known
Oh, I wish I'd known
