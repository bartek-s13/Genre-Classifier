My transistor radio comes from far away
And when it's night over here, over there it's-a breaking day
I remember all the good times I had walking in the sand
With a beautiful girl that I met made in Japan
The beauty of her face was beyond my wildest dreams
Like cherry blossoms blooming in the mountains in the early spring
As we walked by the river and she softly took hold of my hand
That's when I fell deep in love with a girl made in Japan
In the dark of night we would lay on Tokyo Bay
And the singing of the birds woke us up at the break of day
Her smiling eyes always seemed to try to understand
All the love in my heart for the girl made in Japan
My transistor radio comes from far away
And when it's night over here over there it's-a breaking day
She cried when she said she'd been promised to another man
That's when I left my heart with the girl made in Japan
Yes my heart will always be with the girl made in Japan
