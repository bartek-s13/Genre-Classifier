Saturday night shes fancied up, love of her lifes come to pick her up
Theres things in the past she tries to forget
Will he be late be there at all, broken heart man its not her fault
Shes only in love cause shes shot through the heart
Chorus
There he goes, hes doing it again, hes out all night with all his friends
Shes on the couch, her head in her hands
6 AM. hes through the door, Dog house roses scattered on the floor
Shes falling apart, cause shes shot through the heart
Verse 2
How many times must she cry, through it all she stands by his side
He just can't shake monkey off his back
He knows hes wrong to make her cry, whoa and God knows how hard hes tried
To do right by her says its so dam hard
Chorus
Maybe someday hell straighten up, will it be too late, will she have her enough
Shes only in love, she says it so damn hard
She won't be there to watch him die, packs those bags with tear drops in her eyes
Shes leaving him because shes shot through the heart
Chorus 2:
There he goes hes doing it again, hes out all night with all his friends
Shes in her car, her head in her hands
6 am, through the door, dog house roses, they dont work anymore
Cuz her note says good bye cause Im shot through the heart
No more cryin, no, no, cause Im shot through the heart
