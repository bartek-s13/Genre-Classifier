Look at you don't play fair
Not a word, just standing there
You always know what dress to wear
And how to take it off
Second glass and candlelight
In the moment it feels so right
You whisper that you
Want to stay the night
I just laugh because
You ain't nothing
But a champagne promise
All the signs are saying
I should be more cautious
You keep coming closer
And there ain't no stopping
No I can't ever slow you down
And girl I know
What you're really wanting
Before you get to going
Let me tell you something
You ain't nothing
But a champagne promise
And baby you're the finest around
Sweet lips and pretty lies
Say you love me one more time
But she'll be gone
Before you say goodbye
Cause you never do
You ain't nothing
But a champagne promise
All the signs are saying
I should be more cautious
You keep coming closer
And there ain't no stopping
No I can't ever slow you down
Girl I know what
You're really wanting
Before you get to going
Let me tell you something
You ain't nothing
But a champagne promise
And baby you're
The finest around
Oh you're like a bluff
A temporary rush
You like a thought of us
But you ain't nothing
But a champagne promise
All the signs are saying
I should be more cautious
You keep coming closer
And there ain't no stopping
I can't ever slow you down
Girl I know what you're really want
Before you get to going
Let me tell you something
You ain't nothing
But a champagne promise
And baby you're the finest around
A champagne promise
You're the finest around
You're the finest around
