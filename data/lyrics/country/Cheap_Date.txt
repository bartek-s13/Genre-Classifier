Pop the cork on yesterday's wine
'Cause I don't feel like going out tonight
Let's spin a couple of forty-fives
And order some Chinese takeout

Do the dishes and turn down the lights
Watch West Side Story for the eighteenth time
I couldn't think of a better way to spend my Friday night

No cover charge or taxicabs
C'mon, baby, what do you say?

I'll be your cheap date
Put my little black dress away
'Cause I'm not really into the party downtown
I'm more about the right here, right now
Think of all the loving we'll make
Think of all the money we'll save
You don't have to go far to take me home
I'll be your cheap date

Never cared much for fancy champagne
Unpronounceable fancy French names
I'd much rather just sit on the couch and make out

Mmm, it's been a long hard week
And I don't want nothing but you holding me

I'll be your cheap date
Put my little black dress away
'Cause I'm not really into the party downtown
I'm more about the right here, right now
Think of all the loving we'll make
Think of all the money we'll save
You don't have to go far to take me home
I'll be your cheap date, hey

Come a little closer baby
Let me be your cheap date

I'll be your cheap date
Put my little black dress away
'Cause I'm not really into the party downtown
No, I'm more about the you and me, right here and right now
Think of all the loving we'll make
Think of all the money we'll save
You don't have to go far to take me home
I'll be your cheap date
Ooh, I'll be your cheap date
