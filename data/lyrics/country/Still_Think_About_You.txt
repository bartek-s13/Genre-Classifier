We were something special, pretty big deal
Met you at the county fair, kissed you on the Ferris Wheel
All of our friends, they thought we were real
You would say you love me, couldn't look you in the eye
Never meant to hurt you, never meant to make you cry
Just couldn't hold on, believe me, I tried

And now you're calling me a bastard, calling me a liar
Sorry that you fell in love with someone you will never inspire
Sorry that I broke your heart in two
I still think about you
I still think about you

I still think about you every morning, remember what you said
Get your ass up, get yourself out of bed
Then you would kiss me on top of my head
I know you hate me now, but I wanted you to know
Didn't care enough, but I cared enough to let you go
Oh, the bitter seeds we sew

And now you're calling me a bastard, calling me a liar
Sorry that you fell in love with someone you will never inspire
Sorry that I broke your heart in two
And now you're calling me a bastard, calling me a liar
Sorry that you fell in love with someone you will never inspire
Sorry that I broke your heart in two
I still think about you
I still think about you
