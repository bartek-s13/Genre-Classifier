I showed up in this little big town
No clue what was goin' down
Here to find my place in my piece of the dream
I was a pour boy far from home
Writin' my songs with a voice of my own
I got me a job and the boss man said to me

Said son let me make it crystal clear
This is how we do it 'round here

It's yes sir and yes ma'am
If you're wonderin' who's the boss, I am
At the end of the day we know how to have a good time
No excuses and no drama
Treat every woman like she was your mama
Suit up, show up, shut up, and get the job done
Yeah, suit up, show up, shut up, and get the job done

So I saved some money, recorded some songs
I met some people to pass 'em along
I kept on rockin' it, one day I got a call
So I rode on down to music row
With my guitar case and my ballcap on
I sang a few songs and the record man said to me
He said son let me tell you if you want the gig
Don't let your head get too big 'cause round here

It's yes sir and yes ma'am
If you're wonderin' who's the boss, I am
At the end of the day we know how to have a good time
No excuses and no drama
Treat every woman like she was your mama
Suit up, show up, shut up, and get the job done
Yeah, suit up, show up, shut up, and get the job done

One day I'll have a son of my own
I'm gonna sing him this little song
Boy

It's yes sir and yes ma'am
If you're wonderin' who's the boss, I am
At the end of the day we know how to have a good time
No excuses and no drama
Treat every woman like she was your mama
Suit up, show up, shut up, and get the job done
Yeah, suit up, show up, shut up, and get the job done
Get the job done
