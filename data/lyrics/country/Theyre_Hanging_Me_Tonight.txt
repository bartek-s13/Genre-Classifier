When I hear the rain a-comin' down
It makes me sad and blue
Was on a rainy night like this
That Flo said we were through
I told her how I loved her and
I begged her not to go
But another man had changed her mind
So I said goodbye to Flo
Alone within my cell tonight
My heart is filled with fear
The only sound within the room
Is the falling of each tear

I think about the thing I've done
I know it wasn't right
They'll bury Flo tomorrow
But they're hanging me tonight
They're hanging me tonight

That night he came and took my Flo
And headed into town
I knew I had to find this man
And try to gun him down
As I walked by a dim cafe
And I looked through the door
I saw my Flo with her new love
And I couldn't stand no more
I couldn't stand no more
I took my pistol from my hip
And with a trembling hand
I took the life of pretty Flo
And that good for nothin' man
That good for nothin' man
I think about the thing I've done
I know it wasn't right
They'll bury Flo tomorrow
But they're hanging me tonight
They're hanging me tonight
