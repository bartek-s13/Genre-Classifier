I got something kinda special I'd like to say to all you truck drivers out there who might be listening right now
Also a truck drivers prayer I'd like to pass along to you
Cuz I think it's kind of special too
But first, Now I gotta few things I've been wanting to say to you guys for a long time
And I think right now is a good time to do it
Like did you know that me and just about everyone in country music who travel a lot
Have nothing but the highest respect for you the truck driver
Cuz its a fact that some of the best drivers are truck drivers
And the most safety minded, the most courteous and the first to stop and help when there's trouble
And little things like blinking signals lights to help someone pass
So you just gotta be good people
Like some I've had the pleasure of meeting
Down to earth, hard-working family men
And a lot of you like our country music and that makes you okay in my book
Sounds like I'm blowing smoke, don't it
But I'm not
Cuz it boils down to this
If everyone would drive liek you guys do
There would be a lot less accidents and deaths on the highway
So truck driver, buddy, you are appreciated more then you'll ever know
And we salute you, now for the prayer
Now this truck drivers prayer was sent to me, by a truck driver from Oklahoma City
He found it in a truck stop, Mary's Cafe in Cahokia, Il
Now this prayer means a lot to him
And I think it will you too, so if you will give a listen
And see if it isn't your prayer too
Dear God above bless this truck I drive
And help me keep someone alive
Be my mortal sight this day
On the street where little children play
Bless my helper fast asleep
When the night is long and deep
And keep my cargo safe and sound
Through the hours big and round
Make my judgment sound as steel
And be my hands upon the wheel
Bless the traveler going past
And teach them not to go so fast
Give me strength for every trip
So I may care for what they ship
And make me mindful every mile
That life is just a little while....Amen
