If I had it my way
This would be the first time that you made love
I'd be the first man that your hands touched
But we'd both done our share of living
Takin chances we were given
I've never been big on looking back
I don't care if I'm your first love
But I'd love to be your last
If I could do it over
I'd have waited for this moment to give my heart to you unbroken
But if our mistakes brought us together
Doesn't really matter whether, we were saints or sinners in the past
I don't care if I'm your first love
I'd just love to be your last
All I know is what I see when I look at you
And all I see is what I'm feeling down inside
And all I'm feeling is the feeling that I finally got it right
When I wake up tomorrow
I'm going to throw my arms around you
Thank my lucky stars I found you
Cause I know your heart has so much more than any man has touched before that
Nothing matters more to me than that
