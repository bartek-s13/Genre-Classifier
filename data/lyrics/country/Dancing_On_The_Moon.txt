Throw your eyes in my direction
And I'll make you feel nervous again
And then a smile with good intentions
And so I'll take you there just as I said
I've been stumbling on the sun
You've been dancing on the moon
I'm gonna be there soon
Have you heard how I'm feeling?
I've never felt this happy, not in days
Late at night, when I'm sleeping
And when I'm thinking of you as always
I've been stumbling on the dirt
You've been skipping through the clouds
I've been stumbling on the sun
You've been dancing on the moon
Im gonna be there soon
I've been stumbling on the sun
You've been dancing on the moon
I've been stumbling on the sun
You've been dancing on the moon
Im gonna be there soon
And now I'm skipping in the dirt
And skipping through the clouds
I've gotta get there somehow
Take my hand, take me nowhere
There's no place that I'd rather be
Then with you oh my
Into my arms you will be
I've been stumbling on the sun
You've been dancing on the moon
I've been stumbling on the sun
You've been dancing on the moon
Im gonna be there soon
