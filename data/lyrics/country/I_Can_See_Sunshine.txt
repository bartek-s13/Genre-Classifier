I gave my raincoat away I don't need protection
Or feel rain in my face I just feel your affection
When it's a gloomy old day I just remember that you're mine
When I pretend that you're near I can even see sunshine
Even the weatherman don't understand why
When I'm holding your hand there's not a cloud in the sky
Let it rain let it snow no matter what it does outside
When I see love in your eyes I can even see sunshine
Even the weatherman he don't understand why...
When I see love in your eyes I can even see sunshine
