Under covers, late night lovers
In the dark, only in the dark
On the weekends I let you sneak in
You make the rules and I play the part

You don't tell your friends that you stay the night
You won't ever say that you're only mine, yeah

And you know I love that
But when you kiss me on the neck, you make me want that
But then you throw my heart away and pull it right back
The pleasure with the pain, there's something 'bout that
Tryna fight back but I relapse
You know I love that, aw, yeah, yeah, yeah
You know I love that, aw, yeah, yeah, yeah

Heavy breathing, touching, teasing
From the car into the door
And you're not sorry and I'm not worried
The way you leave, I only wanted more

You don't tell your friends that you stay the night
You won't ever say that you're only mine

You know I love that
When you kiss me on the neck, you make me want that
But then you throw my heart away and pull it right back
The pleasure with the pain, there's something 'bout that
Tryna fight back but I relapse
You know I love that, aw, yeah, yeah, yeah
Said you know I love that, aw, yeah, yeah, yeah (Let's go)

You don't tell your friends that you stay the night (Don't tell them)
You won't ever say that you're only mine

And you know I love that
When you kiss me on the neck, you make me want that
But then you throw my heart away and pull it right back
The pleasure with the pain, there's something 'bout that
Tryna fight back but I relapse
You know I love that, aw, yeah, yeah, yeah
Said you know I love that, aw, yeah, yeah, yeah
You know I love that, aw, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's somethin' 'bout that, tryna fight back, but I relapse
You know I love that
