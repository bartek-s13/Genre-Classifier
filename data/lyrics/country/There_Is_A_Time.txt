There is a time for love and laughter
The days will pass like summer storms
The winter winds will follow after
But there is love and love is warm
There is a time for us to wander
When time is young and so are we
The woods are greener over yonder
The path is new, the world is green
There is a time when leaves are falling
The woods are grey, the paths are old
The snow will come when geese are calling
You need a fire against the cold
There is a time for us to wander
When time is young and so are we
The woods are greener over yonder
The path is new, the world is green
So do you roamin’ in the springtime ?
And you find your love in the summer sun
The frost will come and bring the harvest
And you can sleep when day is done
Time is like a river flowin'
With no regrets as it moves on
Around each bend the shinin’ mornin’
And all our friends we though were gone
There is a time for us to wander
When time is young and so are we
The woods are greener over yonder
The path is new, the world is green
The path is new, the world is green
