Here I walk, an empty shell even though
It's hard to tell this lonesome hand
It's taken it's toll and I just don't know how far it can go
Well come down and watch your first step
Don't do anything you might regret
Cause you're much too innocent to suffer
It wasn't all sunny days
Picking through your memories
Oh the rain came down and you covered me in velvet
Oh you covered me in velvet
There you are it's like a song I heard
In a smoky bar where the whiskey stirred
Just like my heart and it's dancing alone
And it seems like it just won't ever end
Well come down and watch your first step
Don't do anything you might regret
Cause you're just much too innocent to suffer
It wasn't all sunny days
Picking through your memories
Oh the rain came down and you covered me in velvet
Oh you covered me in velvet
Another turn, another cautious step
Will we ever learn just how lonesome can get
You caught me running, running away
And I just don't know how long I can stay
Well come down and watch your first step
Don't do anything you might regret
Cause you're much too innocent to suffer
And it wasn't all sunny days
Picking through your memories
Oh the rain came down and you covered me in velvet
Oh you covered me in velvet
Oh you covered me in velvet
In velvet
In velvet
