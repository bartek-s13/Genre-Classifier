Sailors sail
Cowboys ride
Lovers love when they get the chance
Take it slow
Turn down the light
Soft and low
Let the shadows dance
Baby dont hold back
Chorus:
Kiss me in the dark
Roll me through the night
Hold me like you'll never let me go
Hit me with your heart
Til the morning light
Let your skin talk to my soul
Kiss me in the dark
Lets strip away everything
Tonight theres nothing getting in our way
The ties that bind, the wheres and whys
Take em off and leave them all outside
Lock it all outside
Chorus:
Kiss me in the dark
Roll me through the night
Hold me like you'll never let me go
Hit me with your heart
Til the morning light
Let your skin talk to my soul
Kiss me in the dark
Without a single a word
Baby we can say so much
Reveal everything with just one touch
Kiss me in the dark
Roll me through the night
Hold me like you'll never let me go
Hit me with your heart
Til the morning light
Let your skin talk to my soul
Kiss me in the dark
Kiss me in the dark
Yeahhhh
