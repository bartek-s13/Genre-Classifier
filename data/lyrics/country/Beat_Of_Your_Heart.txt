Well, I hear that you're doing unwell
From your smile I could never tell
You open up the door and the world pours in
All of its problems, solutions and sins
Everybody seems to have a remedy
But there ain't no remedy that's ever gonna cure me
Take it while it comes 'cause it don't last long
Hesitate and the moment's gone
Run in the rain and howl at the moon
Fall in love way too soon
Take my hand as the music starts
We'll dance to the beat of your heart
Dance
There's a distance in your eyes
Seems you been looking for a place to hide
There's nothing but love around you my child
But you can't see for your cryin' eyes
You stand in a crowd when you wanna be alone
You're your own contradiction but you're not alone
Take it while it comes 'cause it don't last long
Hesitate and the moment's gone
Run in the rain and howl at the moon
Fall in love way too soon
Take my hand as the music starts
We'll dance to the beat of your heart
Dance
You know you'll stumble down that road
Trembling from the cold
But this heart and this love can save you
It can save you
Take it while it comes 'cause it don't last long
Hesitate and the moment's gone
Run in the rain and howl at the moon
Fall in love way too soon
Take my hand as the music starts
We'll dance to the beat of your heart
And we'll dance to the beat of your heart
And we'll dance to the beat of your heart
To the beat of your heart
To the beat of your heart
