All alone here in this bed, starin' at the TV set
God, how did I get here again?
You say it's over when you leave
Let the world pave way for me
Oh, what I'd give to be a man in times like these
When this wouldn't mean a thing
Learn to look you in the eye, smile and say goodbye
Try to act like you don't hurt like him
But damn, this stubborn heart keeps fallin' apart
No matter how many times I tell myself it's wrong
To be in this love at all
I hate that I love you
It'd be so much easier if it were true
I hate that I love you
But I do, oh, I do
I hate the way you make me feel
I love the way you make me feel
Don't come back, baby, please come back
I hate that I love you
It'd be so much easier if it were true
I hate that I love you
But I do, oh, I do, yes, I do, oh, I do
