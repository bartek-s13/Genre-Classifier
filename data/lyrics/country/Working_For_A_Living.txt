Yeah, some days won't end ever and some days pass on by
I'll be working here forever, at least until I die
Damned if you do, damned if you don't
I'm supposed to get a raise next week, you know damn well I won't
I'm just working for a living
I'm working for a living
Working for a living, living and working
Taking what they giving 'cause I'm working for a living
Hey, I'm not complaining 'cause I really need the work
But hittin' up my buddy's got me feeling like a jerk
Hundred dollar car note, five hundred rent
I get a check on Friday but it's already spent
Working for a living
Working for a living
I'm working for a living, living and working
Taking what they giving 'cause I'm working for a living
Oh, oh, working for a living
Oh, oh, taking what they giving
Oh, oh, working for a living
Oh, oh, oh
Bus boy, bartender, ladies of the night
Grease monkey, ex-junky, winner of the fight
Walkin' on the streets, it's really all the same
Selling souls, rock 'n' roll, any other game
Working for a living
Working for a living
Working for a living, living and working
Taking what they giving 'cause I'm working for a living
Working for a living, living and working
Taking what they giving 'cause I'm working for a living
Working for a living, living and working
