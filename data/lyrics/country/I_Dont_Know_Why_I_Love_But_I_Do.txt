I don't know why I love you but I do
I don't know why I cry so but I do
I only know I'm lonely and that I want you only
I don't know why I love you but I do
I can't sleep nights because I feel so restless
I don't know what to do, I feel so helpless
And since you've went away, I cry both night and day
I don't know why I love you but I do
My days have been so lonely
My nights have been so blue
I don't know how I spend it, but I do
Each night I sit alone and tell myself
That I will fall in love with someone else
I guess I'm wasting time but I've got to clear my mind
I don't know why I love you but I do
My days have been so lonely
My nights have been so blue
I don't know how I spend it, but I do
Each night I sit alone and tell myself
That I will fall in love with someone else
I guess I'm wasting time but I've got to clear my mind
I don't know why I love you
I don't know why I love you
I don't know why I love you but I do
I do
