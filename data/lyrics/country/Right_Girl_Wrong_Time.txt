She talked with a drawl
Had me wrapped around her pretty little finger
Her eyes caught mine
Pulled me in like the tide; hook, line and sinker
I was hung up on her kiss
'Bout as good as it gets

Cause she was the right girl
Yes, she was all mine
Thought about her all day
We spent every night
Chasing down the stars
Talking 'bout forever
But I learned the hard way
Never say never
It's too bad that clocks can't stop on a dime...
Cause she was the right girl
The right girl at the wrong time

Things can't stay the same
When we got a couple hundred miles between each other
Different states, we ain't
We ain't never been good at being long distance lovers
I guess it is what it is
And that's the heartbreak I still can't forget

Cause she was the right girl
Yes, she was all mine
Thought about her all day
We spent every night
Chasing down the stars
Talking 'bout forever
But I learned the hard way
Never say never
It's too bad that clocks can't stop on a dime...
Cause she was the right girl
The right girl at the wrong time

If two hearts were meant to be, they'll find their way I guess
But when goodbye started, man, I was a mess

Cause she was the right girl
Yes, she was all mine
Thought about her all day
We spent every night
Chasing down the stars
Talking 'bout forever
And I learned the hard way
Never say never
It's too bad that clocks can't stop on a dime...
Cause she was the right girl
The right girl, at the wrong time
