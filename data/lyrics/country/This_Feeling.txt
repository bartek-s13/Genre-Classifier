I'm not easily impressed
But I'm impressed
I don't usually wear this dress
But I'm in this dress
I'm not one for wasting time
But you don't feel like wasting time to me, baby

I'm not used to this feeling (yeah I'm losing sleep)
Stabbing holes through the ceiling (yeah what you do to me)
I could push you away but I want you to stay
I'm not used to this feeling
I think I could get used to this feeling

I used to like to be alone
But don't leave me alone
Doing things I don't and I don't understand
How inhibitions turn to keys in the ignition
I'm driving fast and I'm not holding back

I'm not used to this feeling (yeah I'm losing sleep)
Stabbing holes through the ceiling (yeah what you do to me)
I could push you away but I want you to stay
I'm not used to this feeling
I think I could get used to this feeling
This is uncharted territory
A whole new chapter in the story
Is it falling, is it flying
Is it living, is it dying
Feels like I can barely dream without your face showing up

I'm not used to this feeling (yeah I'm losing sleep)
Stabbing holes through the ceiling (yeah what you do to me)
I could push you away but I want you to stay
I'm not used to this feeling
I think I could get used to this feeling

Used to this feeling
Could get used to this feeling
