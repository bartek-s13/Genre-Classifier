Heaven sent an angel to me to save me from life's misery
She seemed to fall right outta the sky
I caught her here in my arms
Well life was pretty peachy things were really keen
All the sudden that ol' gal got mean
Her wings fell off she started turnin' red
And that old broken halo fell right off of her head yeah…
Speak of the devil here she comes
Yeah, she's got this poor boy on the run
Oh, I swear she's got horns and a tail
A pitchfork and a book of spells
Speak of the devil here she comes, and here I go!
Fallen angel fell from grace
They kicked her out of that heavenly place
She was a raisin' hell and breakin' all the rules
Tellin' lies, breakin' hearts, being mean and cruel
So now she's down here on earth doin' the devil's dirty work
Stealin' the soul of every man she can find
Sweet lips and pretty eyes oh they were a thin disguise
My little angel was a devil all along oh…
Speak of the devil here she comes
Yeah, she's got this poor boy on the run
Oh, I swear she's got horns and a tail
A pitchfork and a book of spells
Speak of the devil here she comes, and here I go!
Here I go…Tryin' to duck, tryin' to dodge, tryin' to shake her
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, I can't escape her
She's everywhere I go she knows my every move
Oh I know I'm bound to loose
Speak of the devil here she comes
Yeah, she's got this poor boy on the run
Oh, I swear she's got horns and a tail
A pitchfork and a book of spells
Speak of the devil here she comes, and here I go!
Speak of the devil here she comes
Yeah, she's got this poor boy on the run
Oh, I swear she's got horns and a tail
A pitchfork and a book of spells
Speak of the devil here she comes, and here I go
Speak of the, speak of the, speak of the devil here she comes
Speak of the, speak of the, speak of the devil here she comes
Speak of the, speak of the, speak of the devil here she comes
Speak of the devil here she comes and here I go
