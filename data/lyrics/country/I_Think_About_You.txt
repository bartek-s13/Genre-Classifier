Every time I see a woman on a billboard sign
I think about you
Saying, "Drink this beer and you'll be mine"
I think about you
When an actress on a movie screen
Plays Lolita in some old man's dream
It doesn't matter who she is
I think about you
When I see a pretty woman walking down the street
I think about you
Men look her up and down like she's some kind of treat
Oh, I think about you
She wouldn't dare talk to a stranger
Always has to be aware of the danger
Doesn't matter who she is
I think about you...
Eight years old
Big blue eyes and a heart of gold
When I look at this world
I think about you
And I can't help but see
That every woman used to be
Somebody's little girl
I think about you
Every time I hear people say it's never gonna change
I think about you
Like it's some kinda joke, some kinda game
Girl I think about you
When I see a woman on the news
Who didn't ask to be abandoned or abused
It doesn't matter who she is
I think about you
Eight years old
Big blue eyes and a heart of gold
When I look at this world
I think about you
And I can't help but see that every woman used to be
Somebody's little girl
I think about you
Eight years old
Big blue eyes and a heart of gold
When I look at this world
I think about you
I think about you
Oh, I think about you
Baby I think about you
