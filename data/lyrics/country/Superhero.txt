I used to have a heart like Wonder Woman
When the lightning struck, I felt nothing
The strength I had feels long forgotten
You think love gives you power but it doesn't

I guess love has no place for superheroes
I was bullet-proof but you shot me down
I used to fly, now I fall
I guess I'm human after all
And no, love has no place for superheroes

I thought I was invincible
How did you find me
I thought I was unstoppable
You paralyzed me
If I had to choose between weak and lonely
I'd rather have wings than to be chained to somebody

I guess love has no place for superheroes
I was bullet-proof but you shot me down
I used to fly, now I fall
I guess I'm human after all
I know love has no place for superheroes

I miss the view from the big blue sky
Oh, I miss the dark when I ran with the night
I was the savior, now I need a rescue
I wish I could remember you without you
I miss the view from the big blue sky
Oh, I miss the dark when I ran with the night
I was the savior, now I need a rescue
Wish I could remember you without you

Oh, I guess love has no place for superheroes
I was bullet-proof but you shot me down now
I used to fly, now I fall
I guess I'm human after all
I know love has no place for superheroes
I know love has no place for superheroes
