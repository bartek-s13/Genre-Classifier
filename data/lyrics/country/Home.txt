Got the window rolled down
Hand in the air
Ain't a much better feeling
Then the feeling
Of the freedom there
Mississippi River
Start singing to me
I got the window rolled down
I was always a dreamer
Misunderstood
Guess I would
Have been different
If I could
But who I've been
And who I'm trying to be
Always a dreamer
It's where you're from
It's your oldest friend
And you think
It will forget you
When you go
But you know
It'll take you back in
It won't fade away
It'll watch you leave
Stay sitting there
Waiting in the fields
In the sky in a storm
In your blood
And your bones
Home
We were just babies
Thinking love was a race
Or us taking it further
Then everybody else our age
We were grain in the gravel
We were still green
Oh we were just babies
It's where you're from
It's your oldest friend
And you think
It will forget you
When you go
But you know
It'll take you back in
It won't fade away
It'll watch you leave
Stay sitting there
Waiting in the fields
In the sky in a storm
In your blood
And your bones
Home
If you were just driving
Through town
You'd be telling yourself
This is just nowhere, somewhere
Bypass, don't care
The only way to somewhere else
But damn it ain't the way it felt
It's where you're from
It's your oldest friend
And you think
It will forget you
When you go
But you know
It'll take you back in
It won't fade away
It'll watch you leave
Stay sitting there
Waiting in the fields
In the sky in a storm
In your blood
And your bones
Home
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
