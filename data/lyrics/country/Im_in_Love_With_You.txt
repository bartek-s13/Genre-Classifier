I'm in love with you
I know that there's some things that I'm supposed to do
The rules say that a man should always play it cool
Oh but I'm in love with you
You're like the sweetest song
Rollin' in my head I sing it all day long
You're the only arms I wanna fall into
Oh baby I'm in love with you

Ten feet off the ground
Head up in the clouds
If I'm only dreaming
Then nobody better wake me up
I'd rocket to the moon
Light up all the stars
Spell it out across the evening sky
Hey I'm in love with you

Yes you heard me right
I'm a love struck fool
Yeah I'm that guy
My cards are on the table for the world to view
Hey baby I'm in love with you

I'm in love with you
Picture this
It's a love story you don't wanna miss
Started with a kiss and ended with "I do"
Hey I'm in love with you
