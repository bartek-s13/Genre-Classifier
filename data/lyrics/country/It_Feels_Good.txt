Laying with my lady on the riverbank
She looked over lazy, and she gave me a wink
She said: "there's no sense a working if it's this dang hot"
So dip your toes in the water, baby this is the spot

Well it feels good, good, good
It feels right, right, right
Oh, it feels good, good, good
So, we gonna lay back and let it ride

Well, I bought a scratch off ticket
Well, the winning kind
Well, I saw them lucky sevens in that checkout line
I got a twelve pack, big sack
Carton of smokes
Now I'm dancing like I just saw the Holy Ghost

Well it feels good, good, good
It feels right, right, right
Oh, it feels good, good, good
So, we gonna lay back and let it ride
You got them weekend warriors
Partying all night long
You got them moonshine lovers
Just getting it on
Does it make you feel happy?
Does it make your heart beat?
Does it make you shake it honey?
Does it make you move your feet?

Well it feels good, good, good
It feels right, right, right
Oh, it feels good, good, good
So, we gonna lay back and let it ride
Well it feels good, good, good
It feels right, right, right
Oh, it feels good, good, good
So, we gonna lay back and let it ride
