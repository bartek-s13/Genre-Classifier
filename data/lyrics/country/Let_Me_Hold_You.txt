It's a feeling I get
When you start to cry
Tears down my cell
Like a stormy night
So dry your eyes girl
Ans just let me hold you
I was born to skate on very thin ice
Most of what I do, I don't even think twice
So dry your eyes girl
And just let me hold you
Close your eyes
Hold on tight
Let me run around inside of your mind
Baby, just for tonight
Let me just hold you
I'm the ship that's been tossed
A bridge that's burned
You brought me back from a point of no return
Thank God I'm with you now
So I can just hold you
Oh, there's nothing more that I need to say
I just want to be yours at the end of every day
So I can close my eyes
And just let you hold me
Close your eyes
Hold on tight
Let me run around inside of your mind
Baby, just for tonight
Let me just hold you
For all we know there may not be tomorrow
Let's hold on tight
'Til the mornin' comes
Close your eyes
Hold on tight
Let me run around inside of your mind
Baby, just for tonight
Let me just hold you
Baby, just for tonight
Let me just hold you
