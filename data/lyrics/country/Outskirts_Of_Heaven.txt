My grandpa taught me about buck knifes and shot guns
How to cast an old Zebco
And how to work a stick shift
He taught me the bible about all twelve disciples
And he made sure that I know there's life after this
With pearly gates and streets of gold
He said if I just believe that's where I'll go

Lord when I die I wanna live
On the outskirts of Heaven
Where there's dirt roads for miles
Hay in the fields and fish in the river
Where there's dogwood trees and honey bees
And blue skies and green grass forever
Lord when I die, I wanna live on the outskirts of Heaven

Now it says in the King James in the Almighty's kingdom
He mentions a mansion that he's built just for me
Now I'd gladly trade it for a farm house with acreage
And a back yard that's shaded and a squeaky front porch swing
That's where I wanna hang my wings

When I die I wanna live on the outskirts of Heaven
Where there's dirt roads for miles
Hay in the fields and fish in the river
Where there's dogwood trees and honey bees
And blue skies and green grass forever
So Lord when I die, I wanna live on the outskirts of Heaven
Yeah

Yeah, the good Lord knows me
He knows I need blue skies and green grass forever
Lord when I die I wanna live on the outskirts of Heaven
Yeah, when I die I wanna live on the outskirts of Heaven
