She knows every move that a man could make
She knows every trick in the book
She knows how to give, she knows how to take
But so many times she's been taken a fool

By those alibis and lying eyes and all the best lines
Lord knows she's heard 'em all
She's been cheated on and pushed around and left alone
Lord knows what I've put her through
But boy you can bet, if a move can be made
She knows how to make one on you

She once thought that love wasn't just a game
Her feelin's once came from the heart
One day I gave her a wedding ring
And one night I tore all those feelin's apart

With my alibis and lyin' eyes and all the best lines
Lord knows she's heard 'em all
She's been cheated on and pushed around and left alone
Lord knows what I've put her through
But boy you can bet, if a move can be made
She knows how to make

Her own alibis and lyin' eyes and all the best lines
Lord knows she's heard 'em all
She's been cheated on and pushed around and left alone
Lord knows what I've put her through
And boy you can bet, if a move can be made
She knows how to make one on you
