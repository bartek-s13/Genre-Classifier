Sittin' on the front porch, pickin' and singin'
Talkin' all about them good ol' days
Back when we were just young kids
Nobody gave a damn what we had to say

Well, hey, brother, would ya look at us tonight
Playin' these strolls to a sold-out crowd
Just tryin' to make mom and daddy proud
They wouldn't have it any other way

Seems everybody these days is blowin' smoke
Keep your 15 minutes, give me somethin' more
Somethin' bigger than you and me
Gonna do right by our family
Put a score on the board for the humble folk
All right now

One of these days I'm gonna head my ass back home
And tell you that I love you, gotta let you know
It's you all along I've been doin' this for
Owe everything I have to the humble folks
Gonna give it all back to the humble folks

Seems everybody these days is blowin' smoke
Well, keep your 15 minutes, give me somethin' more
Somethin' bigger than you and me
Gonna do right by our family
Put a score on the board for the humble folk
All right now
Put a score on the board for the humble folk (All right gonna)
We're gonna put a score on the board for the humble folk
Well, all right now
