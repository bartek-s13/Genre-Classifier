Lord, help me walk
Another mile
Just one more mile
I'm tired of walking all alone
Lord, help me smile
Another smile
Just one more smile
I know I just can't make it on my own
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)

I’ve never thought I needed help before
I thought that I could do things by myself
Now I know I just can't take it any more
With a humble heart
On bended knees
I'm begging you please
Help Me

Come down from your golden throne to me
To lowly me
I need to feel the touch of your tender hand
Remove the chains of darkness
And let me see
Lord let me see
Just where I fit into your master plan
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)

I’ve never thought I needed help before
I thought that I could do things by myself
But now I know I just can't take it any more
With a humble heart
On bended knees
I'm begging you please
Help me

With a humble heart
On bended knees
I'm begging you please
Help me
