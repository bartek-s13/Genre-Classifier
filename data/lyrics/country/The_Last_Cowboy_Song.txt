This the last cowboy song:
The end of a hundred year waltz
The voices sound sad as they're singin' along
Another piece of America's lost

He rides the feed lots, clerks in the markets
On weekends sellin' tobacco and beer
And his dream's of tomorrow, surrounded by fences
But he'll dream tonight of when fences weren't here
He blazed the trail with Lewis and Clark
And eyeball to eyeball, old Wyatt backed down
He stood shoulder to shoulder with Travis in Texas
And rode with the Seventh when Custer went down


Remmington showed us how he looked on canvas
And Louis Lamour has told us his tale
Me and Johnny and Waylon and Kris sing about him
And wish to God we could have ridden his trail
The old Chisholm trail is covered in concrete now
They truck it to market in fifty foot rigs
They roll by his markings and don't even notice
Like living and dying was all he ever did


To Fade
