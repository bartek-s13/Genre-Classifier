A lot of folks have told me
I was pulled 'fore I got ripe
A winter apple picked off in the fall
But even as a youngen'
I was not the bashful type
'Cause I could yell the loudest of them all

I'm little but I'm loud
I'm poor but I'm proud
I'm countrified and I don't care who knows it
I'm like a banty rooster
In a big red rooster crowd
I'm puny, short and little but I'm loud

I learned to do my singing
Walking 'long behind a plow
The singing teachers always passed me by
And so I have to sing
The only way that I know how
Just rare back, open up and let her fly

I'm little but I'm loud
I'm poor but I'm proud
I'm countrified and I don't care who knows it
I'm like a banty rooster
In a big red rooster crowd
I'm puny, short and little but I'm loud

I sang a special solo song
In church one Sunday morn
And I was plumb embarrassed to my skin
I hit a high note, looked around
And sure as I was born
Two cows and fourteen hogs came walking in

I'm little but I'm loud
I'm poor but I'm proud
I'm countrified and I don't care who knows it
I'm like a banty rooster
In a big red rooster crowd
I'm puny, short and little but I'm loud
