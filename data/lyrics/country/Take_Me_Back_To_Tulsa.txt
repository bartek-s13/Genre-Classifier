Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry
You see that girl with the red dress on
Some folks call her Dinah
Stoled my heart away from me
Way down in Louisiana
Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry
The big bee sucks the blossom
And the little bee makes the honey
Poor man throws the cotton
And the rich man makes the money
Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry
We travel all over this country wide
Playing music by the hour
Always wear this great big smile
We never do look sour
Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry
Would I go
You
Let me off
And I'll walk down to Greenwood
Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry
