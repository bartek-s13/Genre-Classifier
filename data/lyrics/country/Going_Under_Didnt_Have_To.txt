Could of up and walked away
Coulda stood you up on our first date
Coulda let you wait for me all day
Coulda said no to that first drink
Coulda just went home and watched TV
Instead I stayed and told you everything
And, I know I
I coulda turned the car around
I wonder, where would we be now
No I didn't have to
Fall for you
I know I didn't have to
But I did, now I'm in, and I'm going under
No I didn't have to
Say I love you
I know I didn't have to
But I did, now I'm in, and I'm going under
Coulda left you when it got to hard
And sell all your stuff, take your guitar
And not care just let us fall apart
I coulda just not picked up the phone
When you said you'd miss me, come on home
Pretend I'm better off alone
I know I
Didn't have to turn around
I wonder
Where would we be now
No I didn't have to
Fall for you
I know I didn't have to
But I did, now I'm in, and I'm going under
No I didn't have to
Say I love you
I know I didn't have to
But I did, now I'm in, and I'm going under
Going under, going under
No I didn't have to
But I did, now I'm in, and I'm going under
Under my skin, got into my head, got under my covers
Came into my life, got into my heart, like no other
Got under my skin, got into my head, got under my covers
Came into my life, got into my heart, like no other
No I didn't have to
Fall for you
I know I didn't have to
But I did, now I'm in, and I'm going under
No I didn't have to
Say I love you
I know I didn't have to
But I did, now I'm in, and I'm going under
Got under my skin, got into my head, got under my covers
Came into my life, got into my heart, like no other
Got under my skin, got into my head, got under my covers
Came into my life, got into my heart, like no other
