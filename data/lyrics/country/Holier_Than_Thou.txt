I can't wait for you to forget me
And ask what my name is again
Your life is so cool and exciting
I wonder what it's like to be your friend
And when you're looking in the mirror
Is it just so clear

You're holier than thou
That crown fits you so good, you never should take it off
Hey you, how'd you get better than the whole damn room?
You're so high and mighty, mighty
I'm blessed to be next to you
I'd say you're just like me, like me
But you're holier than thou

You can't help that your touch is like Midas
It's gotta be tough having all eyes on you
There was a time you would've said hi at this party
I'm so glad you figured out

You're holier than thou
That crown fits you so good, you never should take it off
Hey you, how'd you get better than the whole damn room?
You're so high and mighty, mighty
I'm blessed to be next to you
I'd say you're just like me, like me
But you're holier than thou

Everything that rises always gotta come down
But you don't seem to be worried about that right now
That the law of gravity doesn't apply to you

You're holier than thou
That crown fits you so good, you never should take it off
Hey you, how'd you get better than the whole damn room?
You're so high and mighty, mighty
I'm blessed to be next to you
I'd say you're just like me, like me
But you're holier than thou
