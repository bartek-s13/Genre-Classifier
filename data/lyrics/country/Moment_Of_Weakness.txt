Boy it could've been the song they were playing
Making everything you say sound so right
I swear I had no intentions of staying
I can't fake it, you're breaking me down tonight

Let your kiss tear down my defences now
I'm not strong enough to care
I didn't mean to fall in love
Or tell you any of my secrets
But you caught me in a moment of weakness
Yeah you caught me in a moment of weakness

So hold me close enough to feel your heart beating
I can't even think about letting you go
I'm way past looking for another good reason
I'm just needing to lose a little more control

Let your kiss tear down my defences now
I'm not strong enough to care
I didn't mean to fall in love
Or tell you any of my secrets
But you caught me in a moment of weakness
Yeah you caught me in a moment of weakness
So let your kiss tear down my defenses now
I'm not strong enough to care
I didn't mean to fall in love
Or tell you any of my secrets (tell you)
But you caught me in a moment of weakness
Yeah you caught me in a moment of weakness
Weakness
