You showed up
Shined up
Blew me away like a cloud of dust
Triple black on that four fifty four
I never seen you
But that's what I knew
I'll go anywhere you want me to
Into the wild blue
I never felt like that before

You rode in
In the dark
Like a sundance kid
Boy you stole my heart
Saddle up
That Chevelle
And we kicked it into gear and we drove it like hell
Just rolling
Till the trail ends
Just like John Wayne would do
I love that cowboy side of you
Love that cowboy side of you, yeah
 
Midnight
Headlights
Leaving that one horse town behind
Getting off on some lost highway
Yeah
Riding shotgun
Sitting pretty
My Vaquero riding right here with me
I can always csount on you to save the day

You rode in
In the dark
Like a sundance kid
Boy you stole my heart
Saddle up
That Chevelle
And we kicked it into gear
And we drove it like hell
Just rolling
Till the trail ends
Just like John Wayne would do
I love that cowboy side of you, yeah
