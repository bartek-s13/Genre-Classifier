She's looking Friday night ready
Tearing up in interstate twenty
Got the tank topped off
Dust flying like confetti in the rear view
Got a clear view of these getaway tracks

You've got the seat kicked back
Radio bumping that classic
You looking at me, looking at you
Surfing that hand with the power lines
Yeah in no time we're nowhere fast

We're just wasting gas, blurring them dotted lines
Killing all kinds of time, baby, like we ain't coming back
Steal a kiss, maybe two, pull it off for a few
Gonna hang as long as I can, you know I don't give a damn
If we're just wasting gas

Every once in a while it'll backfire like a gun
I see that needle creeping down like a setting sun
You're making every little memory one of a kind
You and I riding high all night
We're just wasting gas, blurring them dotted lines
Killing all kinds of time, baby, like we ain't coming back
Steal a kiss, maybe two, pull it off for a few
Gonna hang as long as I can, you know I don't give a damn
If we're just wasting gas
Woah, woahoo, woah, woahoo
We're just wasting gas, blurring them dotted lines
Killing all kinds of time, baby, like we ain't coming back
Steal a kiss, maybe two, pull it off for a few
Gonna hang as long as I can, you know I don't give a damn
If we're just wasting gas
Where we are
We're just wasting gas
Wasting gas..
