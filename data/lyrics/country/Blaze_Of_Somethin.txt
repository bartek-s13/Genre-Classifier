When my road runs out
You're gonna find me with my lead foot down
Rear view mirror, ripped off the windshield
Regrets nowhere near
When my blood runs cold
And it don't matter if I'm young or old
Cause when it's all said and done
I値l be long gone with the sun
They're gonna know that I was here

Gonna bang that drum, gonna light it up
Every bullet in the gun
Shot across the midnight sky
Ain't leavin' one behind
Love even if it hurts
Even if I crash and burn
All the way down to the embers
Leave them something to remember
Might be glory, might be flames
When the good lord calls my name
Stand my ground, run from nothin'
I'm going out in a blaze of somethin'

I知 gonna come on strong
Like there's no tomorrow comin' on
Enjoy the good times while you've got 'em
'Cause who knows how long you've got 'em
Raise your glass and sing along
Gonna bang that drum, gonna light it up
Every bullet in the gun
Shot across the midnight sky
Ain't leavin' one behind
Love even if it hurts
Even if I crash and burn
All the way down to the embers
Leave them something to remember
Might be glory, might be flames
When the good lord calls my name
Stand my ground, run from nothin'
I'm going out in a blaze of somethin'

We all may be shooting stars
Here today, but gone tomorrow
And I知 gonna keep on shining while I知 here

Gonna bang that drum, gonna light it up
Every bullet in the gun
Shot across the midnight sky
Ain't leavin' one behind
Love even if it hurts
Even if I crash and burn
All the way down to the embers
Leave them something to remember
Might be glory, might be flames
When the good lord calls my name
Stand my ground, run from nothin'
I'm going out in a blaze of somethin'
In a blaze of somethin'
Yeah, I'm goin' out, and I'm goin' out
Yeah, in a blaze of somethin'
Yeah, I'm goin' out, I'm goin' out
