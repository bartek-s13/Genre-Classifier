Yeah, man it's messed up times
Half the world's done lost its mind
The rest are looking for a sign
Just to hold on to
You can't believe what's on the news
They lie to your face is what they do
They think we're all just a bunch of fools

And that's the damn truth
The way I see it
That's the damn truth
Take it or leave it
It don't change
You better believe it
We live in a world of lies
That's the damn truth

Booze and drugs will rot your brain
Too much pleasure brings you pain
But you can die from just about anything
The past is better off left behind
Worry is always a waste of time
Money ain't always the bottom line

And that's the damn truth
The way I see it
That's the damn truth
Take it or leave it
It don't change
You better believe it
We live in a world of lies
That's the damn truth

We oughta help the ones in need
Help a man get back on his feet
You oughta work if you wanna eat
If you can
Can't never did, won't never will
The road to ruin is all downhill
You can't get back the time you kill

And that's the damn truth
The way I see it
That's the damn truth
Take it or leave it
It don't change
You better believe it
We live in a world of lies
That's the damn truth

So many times it's been denied
But I see it in my children's eyes

And that's the damn truth
The way I see it
That's the damn truth
Take it or leave it
It don't change
You better believe it
We live in a world of lies
That's the damn truth
