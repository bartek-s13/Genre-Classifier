Charlie's got a gold watch
Don't seem like a whole lot
After thirty years of driving up and down the interstate
But Charlie's had a good life
And Charlie's got a good wife
And after tonight she'll no longer be counting the days
Eighteen wheels and a dozen roses
Ten more miles on his four-day run
A few more songs from the all-night radio
Then he'll spend the rest of his life with the one that he loves
They'll buy a Winnebago
Set out to find America
They'll do a lot of catching up a little at a time
With pieces of the old dream
They're gonna light the old flame
Doing what they please, leaving every other reason behind
Eighteen wheels and a dozen roses
Ten more miles on his four-day run
A few more songs from the all-night radio
Then he'll spend the rest of his life with the one that he loves
Eighteen wheels and a dozen roses
Ten more miles on his four-day run
A few more songs from the all-night radio
Then he'll spend the rest of his life with the one that he loves
