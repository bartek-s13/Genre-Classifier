I could tell you stories
Could you teach me some more?
I’ll tell you ’bout the countries
You’ve never been before
I’ll go on forever
Forever and a day
Until you lose the interest
Right then I’ll walk away
So I won’t let that happen
Not while we’re living free
I can be the poet
You can be the story
You can keep me grounded
Keep me on my toes
I’ll always be chasing you
Wherever you may go
And if you slip ahead
And break away from us
Don’t run out of sight
I just might not catch up
But I won’t let that happen
Not while we’re having fun
You can be the runner
I can be the gun
I’ll be waiting for you here
When you come calling
I’ll be waiting
Biding my time, biding my time
Waiting for you here
Biding my time here
We can sit in silence
I know that’s what you love
I’ll learn to appreciate
The beauty from a loud
And I can share my secrets
I’ve only sung before
You can choose to stand by me
Or simply to ignore
So I won’t let that happen
Not while we both belong
I can be the singer
You can be the song
I’ll be waiting for you here
When you come calling
I’ll be waiting
Biding my time, biding my time
Waiting for you here
Biding my time here
I could tell you stories
Could you teach me some more?
I’ll tell you ’bout the countries
You’ve never been before
I’ll go on forever
Forever and a day
Until you lose the interest
Right then I’ll walk away
So I won’t let that happen
Not while we both belong
I can be the singer
You can be the song
I’ll be waiting for you here
When you come calling
I’ll be waiting
Biding my time, biding my time
Waiting for you here
Biding my time here
Biding my time, biding my time
Waiting for you here
Biding my time here
Biding my time, biding my time
Waiting for you here
Biding my time here
