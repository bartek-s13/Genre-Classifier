I'll love you enough for both of us
Till you decide just how you feel
You're still not sure if you love me or not
So I'll love you enough for both of us
I hope in time you'll find
That I'm your every dream come true
A spark within your heart may start to glow
But then again
It just might end it could be this way too
Whatever happens
I want you to know
I'll love you enough for both of us
Always remember how I feel
I'll wait around until you know for sure
And I'll love you enough for both of us
I'll love you enough for both of us
