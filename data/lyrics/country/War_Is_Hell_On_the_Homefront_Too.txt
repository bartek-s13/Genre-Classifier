It was July hot in Georgia in 1942
All the men were off to war and the women had nothing to do
I was sixteen and hungry for my first taste of love
When I brought the groceries to her door I didn't know how close I was
Her long blond hair was flowing and she smelled like sweet perfume
When I laid the groceries down she said you don't have to leave so soon
A woman sure gets lonely when her man's gone off to fight
She reached out for my trembling hand as teardrops filled her eyes then she said
War is hell on the homefront God only knows what a woman goes through
She still needs what a man that's gone can't do
I can't fight this fire alone stay with me until it's gone
Oh war is hell on the homefront too
It was July hot inside me as she lead me to her bedroom door
The satin sheets and pleasures I never knew I could feel before
My first taste of loving was everything that it should have been
When a woman's fighting loneliness it's a battle she can't win
I'll always remember what she did and what she said
But the one thing that I'll remember most
Is the way she turned his picture over
Face down on the table by her bed then she said
War is hell on the homefront too God only knows what a woman goes through
She still needs what a man that's gone can't do
I can't fight this fire alone stay with me until it's gone
Oh war is hell on the homefront too
War is hell on the homefront God only knows what a woman goes through
She still needs what a man that's gone can't do
I can't fight this fire alone stay with me until it's gone
Oh war is hell on the homefront too
