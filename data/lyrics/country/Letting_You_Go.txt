Wasn't I brushing the hair from your face
Wasn't I just drying your tears and singing you sweet dreams at night
Seems like it was just yesterday
Suddenly you're seventeen
And it's just eighteen months till goodbye

I'd rather deny it
And God knows I've tried
I could keep you here at home
But I know

Loving you is holding you
And lifting you up
And planting the seeds and then watching you grow
And even though it's hard to do
It's letting you fall
And giving you wings so you fly on your own
'Cause part of loving you is letting you go

All of your life I've prepared you to leave
Now that little boys all grown up
And it's too late for changing your mind
Nobody ever warned me that the years go too fast
And there's just no pressing rewind

'Cause time is a liar
Wish I could set the clock on fire
Turn it back to yesterday
But it just keeps ticking away

Loving you is holding you
And lifting you up
And planting the seeds and then watching you grow
And even though it's hard to do
It's letting you fall
And giving you wings so you fly on your own
'Cause part of loving you is letting you go
No matter how I wanna make you stay
You were also born to fly away
Loving you is holding you
And lifting you up
And planting the seeds and then watching you grow
And even though it's hard to do
It's letting you fall
And giving you wings so you fly on your own
'Cause part of loving you is letting you go
Letting you go
