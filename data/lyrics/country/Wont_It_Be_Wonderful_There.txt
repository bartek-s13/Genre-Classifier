When with the Savior we enter the glory land
Won't it be wonderful there
Ended the troubles and cares of the story land
Won't it be wonderful there
Won't it be wonderful there
Having no burdens to bear
Joyously singing with heart-bells a-ringing
Won't it be wonderful there
Walking and talking with Christ the Supernal One
Won't it be wonderful there
Praising adoring the matchless Eternal One
Won't it be wonderful there
Won't it be wonderful there
Having no burdens to bear
Joyously singing with heart-bells a-ringing
Won't it be wonderful there
There where the tempest will never be sweeping us
Won't it be wonderful there
Sure that forever the Lord will be keeping us
Won't it be wonderful there
Won't it be wonderful there
Having no burdens to bear
Joyously singing with heart-bells a-ringing
Won't it be wonderful there
