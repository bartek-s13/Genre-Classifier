You might think, I've had too much to drink
By the way I'm grinnin', stumblin' over every word I say
Yeah, you might ask just how much Jack I had
I know I'm trippin' while I'm sippin', but baby just listen
I can explain all that

It ain't the whiskey makin' me dizzy like this
It's your lips, on my lips
Feel a little tipsy with you pushin' up against me
Your hand in the pocket of my blue jeans
Well I ain't had enough to have this kind of buzz
'Cause I've had enough to know what it does
And it ain't the whiskey makin' me dizzy

Girl this crowd
It's gettin' just a little too loud
What do ya' say we ease our way
Right on outta here
Go tell your girlfriends
I'll be takin' you home tonight
They can leave when they please
Get you home in one piece
Yeah, I'm alright to drive
It ain't the whiskey makin' me dizzy like this
It's your lips, on my lips
Feel a little tipsy with you pushin' up against me
Your hand in the pocket of my blue jeans
Well I ain't had enough to have this kind of buzz
'Cause I've had enough to know what it does
And it ain't the whiskey makin' me dizzy, oh no

Oh I've had the strong stuff, the 90 proof
But it don't hit me, hit me like you do

Oh it ain't the whiskey makin' me dizzy like this
It's your lips, on my lips
Feel a little tipsy with you pushin' up against me
Your hand in the pocket of my blue jeans
Well I ain't had enough to have this kind of buzz
'Cause I've had enough to know what it does
And it ain't the whiskey makin' me dizzy, oh no

Oh it ain't the whiskey
No it ain't the whiskey makin' me dizzy, oh no
It ain't the whiskey
