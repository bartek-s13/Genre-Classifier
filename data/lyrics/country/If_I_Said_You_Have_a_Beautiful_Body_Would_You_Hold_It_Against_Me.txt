If I said you have a beautiful body
Would you hold it against me?
If I swore you were an angel
Would you treat me like the devil tonight?
If I was dying of thirst
Would your flowing love come quench me?
If I said you have a beautiful body
Would you hold it against me?

Now we could talk all night
About the weather
Could tell you about my friends
Out on the coast
I could ask a lot of crazy questions
Or ask you what I really wanna know

If I said you have a beautiful body
Would you hold it against me?
If I swore you were an angel
Would you treat me like the devil tonight?
If I was dying of thirst
Would your flowing love come quench me?
If I said you have a beautiful body
Would you hold it against me?

Now rain can fall so soft
Against the window
Sun can shine so bright
Up in the sky
But Daddy always told me
"Don't make small talk"
He said, "Come on out and say
What's on your mind"

So if I said you have a beautiful body
Would you hold it against me?
If I swore you were an angel
Would you treat me like the devil tonight?
If I was dying of thirst
Would your flowing love come quench me?
If I said you have a beautiful body
Would you hold it against me?

If I said you have a beautiful body
Would you hold it against me?
If I swore you were an angel
Would you treat me like the devil tonight?
