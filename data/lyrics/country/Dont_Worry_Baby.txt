Well it's been building up inside of me
For I don't know how long
I don't know why but I keep thinking
Something's bound to go wrong
But he looks in my eyes and
Makes me realize
When he says

Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Everything will turn out alright
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby oooh

I guess he should've kept his mouth shut
When he started braggin' 'bout his car
But he can't back down now because he
Pushed the other guys too far
I may give one a drive
He makes me come alive
When he says

Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Everything will turn out alright
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby oooh


I told him baby when you race today
Just take along my love with you
And if you know how much I love you baby
Nothing can go wrong with you
Oh what he does to me
When he makes love to me
And he says

Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Everything will turn out alright
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby

Everything will turn out alright
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby oooh
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Everything will turn out alright
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
