Sun comes up, Sun goes down
This ol' world keeps spinning around
Not much has changed since you been gone
I miss you honey, but life goes on
It's nice to see
You still think about me
But don't worry about my heart
Thanks for the call
Yeah I took a fall
But I didn't fall apart
Sun comes up, Sun goes down
This ol' world keeps spinning around
Not much has changed since you been gone
I miss you honey but life goes on
You say you can tell
That I'm doin' well
By the sound of my voice
What'd you expect
Baby when you left
You left me no choice
Sun comes up, Sun goes down
This ol' world keeps spinning around
Not much has changed since you been gone
I miss you honey but life goes on
Thanks to you
Sayin' we're through
I've gotten good at gettin' by
I don't know when
But I'll love again
It's just a matter of time
Sun comes up, Sun goes down
This ol' world keeps spinnin' around
Not much has changed since you been gone
I miss you honey but life goes on
I miss you honey but life goes on
I miss you honey but life goes on
