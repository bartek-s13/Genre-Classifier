Raindrops heading my way
In a Camry with some cabernet
On the front seat, on the hands free she calls me to say
She’s coming to my place
Clouds, are closing in around this house
Lock the door and shut the windows down
Light a candle, in case I can’t see you
When the lights go out
Here you come girl crashing down
Like a sweet summer rain on dust bowl town
Wreck my bed like a cyclone wind
Girl your love’s like watching a storm roll in
Girl your love’s like watching a storm roll in
Lighting strike, who said it couldn’t hit the same spot twice
Don’t stop never sounded so right
Yeah the thunder, rolling under the covers
Better hold on tight, hold on tight
Here you come girl crashing down
Like a sweet summer rain on dust bowl town
Wreck my bed like a cyclone wind
Girl your love’s like watching a storm roll in
Girl your love’s like watching a storm roll in
In the morning I’ll say
Girl you blew me away
That’s the thing about storms
The don’t stick around
I know your gonna leave but girl right now
Here you come girl crashing down
Like a sweet summer rain on dust bowl town
Wreck my bed like a cyclone wind
Girl your love’s like watching a storm roll in
Girl your love’s like watching a storm roll in
