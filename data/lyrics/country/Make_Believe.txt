He'll beat your ass for lying
And he calls himself a man
He shows that he loves you
With the backside of his hand
You always call me crying
Swearing that you'll leave
Baby girl, you're just my make believe
We met through beers and backroads
I was sleeping with your friend
Luckily for me she's a light weight
And you were cool with one night stands
And the lies seemed to continue
For fifty two weeks
Sometimes I wish it didn't happen
And this was all just make believe
Cause it ain't fair to me and you
It ain't worth all the trouble we been going through
To make believe that we will ever be more than we are right now
And his love won't stop your crying
And your tears won't stop me trying
To get over you
Years went by and we kept in touch
Hanging on but not by much
Cause you fell for the pipeline and all its money
He'd promise you the moon and stars
But you got shoes and diamond hearts
And this old heart's run away from lonely
That's why you call me
And it ain't fair to me and you
It ain't worth all the trouble we been going through
To make believe that we will ever be more than we are right now
Cuz love won't stop your crying
And your tears won't stop me trying
To get over you
Fuck all this, I'm giving up
Don't call my phone when it gets tough
And if you do leave your reason after the beep
Why can't you see I'd be good to you?
If I can't have whole, then half will do
I'll be at your house in 20 minutes
Cuz it ain't fair to me and you
It ain't worth all the trouble we been going through
To make believe that we will ever be more than we are right now
Cuz love won't stop your crying
And your tears won't stop me trying
To get over you
You'll find way back into my arms
And I'll pray you never leave
Prove me wrong and make me know that you're not my make believe
