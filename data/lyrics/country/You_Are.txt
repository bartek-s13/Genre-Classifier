I'm a real black-and-whiter
I'm a half-glass-empty negative-sider
I'm a jerk when I'm mad
I'm good at running my mouth
But I don't like to brag about that
Ha, but about that, I ain't worth it
Lord knows I ain't perfect

But you are the best decision that I ever made
You are everything to everything I ain't
You're one is seven billion
Girl I've been near and far
Ain't nobody like who you are
And I love who you are
'Cause you know who you are
Can't believe that you're mine, all mine
But you are

Sometimes I wonder why you put up with me
I'm in over my head, girl, I'm out of my league
I'm a hell of a man, I'm hell on you girl
If I could I'd tell the whole world

You are the best decision that I ever made
You are everything to everything I ain't
You're one is seven billion
Girl I've been near and far
Ain't nobody like who you are
And I love who you are
'Cause you know who you are
Can't believe that you're mine, all mine
But you are

You are the best decision that I ever made
You are everything to everything I ain't
You're one is seven billion
Girl I've been near and far
Ain't nobody like who you are
And I love who you are
'Cause you know who you are
Can't believe that you're mine, all mine
But you are

Can't believe, can't believe that you're mine
But you are
Yeah you are
Yeah you are
Yeah you are
Can't believe that you're mine all mine
But you are
