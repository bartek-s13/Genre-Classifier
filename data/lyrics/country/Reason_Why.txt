Love is a gamble, it's a game
But those dice ain’t been rolling my way
It's a song we've all heard
But I don’t seem to know the words
I swore I had given up on it
But you walked in and made me want it

You're the reason why
Right now I'm down to give it one more try
Open up my heart again
Everything I said I wouldn't do
Is everything I wanna do with you
And you're the reason why

Used to be downtown, city lights
Burning up all my nights
Drowning in a last call round
I was lost but now I'm found

And you're the reason why
Right now I'm down to give it one more try
Open up my heart again
Everything I said I wouldn’t do
Is everything I wanna do with you
And you’re the reason why, yeah

I swore I had given up on it
But you walked in and made me want it

You're the reason why
Right now I’m down to give it one more try
Open up my heart again
Everything I said I wouldn't do
Is everything I wanna do with you
And you're the reason why
You're the reason why
