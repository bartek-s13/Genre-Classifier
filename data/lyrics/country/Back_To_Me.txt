Girl
Just a small town girl
 world
Just a small town girl

Dreams
I know you got your dreams
But you're not here with me
Am I still in your dreams?

One way town
With no way out
It's holding you in
And it's holding you down
But I'll be the one
Who will set your heart free
If you come back to me

Boy
Just a rebel boy
Raising hell, making noise
Just a rebel boy

Scars
I know I've left some scars
But we've come too far
To stop, because of a couple of scars

One way town
With no way out
It's holding you in
And it's holding you down
But I'll be the one
Who will set your heart free
If you come back to me
If you come back to me
You come back


Girl
Just a small town girl
I'm just a rebel boy
In love with a small town girl
