When you found somebody new I thought I never would
Forget you for I thought then I never could
But time has taken all the pains away
Until now I'm down to cryin' once a day

Once a day, all day long
And once a night from dusk 'til dawn
The only time I wish you weren't gone
Is once a day, every day, all day long

Well I'm so glad that I'm not like a girl I knew one time
She lost the one she loved then slowly lost her mind
She sat around and cried her life away
Lucky me I'm only crying once a day

Once a day, all day long
And once a night from dusk 'til dawn
The only time I wish you weren't gone
Is once a day, every day, all day long

Once a day, every day, all day long
