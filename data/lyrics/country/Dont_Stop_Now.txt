Girl you got trouble on your lips
You got seduction on your fingertips
And when you snap your fingers, all the lights go out
Baby when you touch me now

I can feel the way you move me
Every look just goes right through me
You could be the one that takes me down
But I just can't help it
Every kiss you take me closer to the edge
Pull me over
You got me high above the ground
So baby don't stop now

I can feel the thunder every time we kiss
I never thought I'd break down quite like this
When you let your red dress to the floor
Baby just lock the door

'Cause I can feel the way you move me
Every look just goes right through me
You could be the one that takes me down
But I just can't help it
Every kiss you take me closer to the edge and pull me over
You got me high above the ground
So baby don't stop now

And I can feel the way you move me
Every look just goes right through me
You could be the one that takes me down
But I just can't help it
Every kiss you take me closer to the edge and pull me over
You got me high above the ground
So baby don't stop now
Baby don't stop now
So baby don't stop now
