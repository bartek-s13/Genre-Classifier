I've been watching my weight
I've been trying to do right
I've been trying to get little more sleep at night
I've been working like a dog
I've been going to church
Yeah, I've been being so damn good, it hurts

I kinda wanna lit up a couple of smokes
Kinda some Crown mixed in my coke
Kinda wanna hole up in some corner booth somewhere
I kinda wanna find a pretty little thing
That's kinda like me, don't want no strings
Knowing in the morning, it ain't going no where
But tonight, I kinda don't care

No, I don't wanna think bout nothing at all
I don't wanna sit around here all night, wishing you'd call
I kinda wanna drown your memory
Kinda wanna raise my finger to all them used to be's

Yeah, I kinda wanna lit up a couple of smokes
Kinda some Crown mixed in my coke
Kinda wanna hole up in some corner booth somewhere
I kinda wanna find a pretty little thing
That's kinda like me, don't want no strings
Knowing in the morning, it ain't going no where
But tonight, I kinda don't care

Kinda don't care
Hell if you don't care, then I kinda don't care

Aww hell, I don't care
