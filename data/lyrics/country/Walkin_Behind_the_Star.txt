When that old wild west needed tamed
A special breed was born
Instilled with the courage to walk behind the stars
Make a stand or the rights of man
Knowing it could mean their lives
But somebody had to draw the line between wrong and right
Nowadays it's not much different
Just the unicorns have changed
People need protecting
Where evil still remains
So God bless all of the women and men
Sworn to uphold the law
And thank them for the fallen ones
The ones that gave it all
Walking behind the stars
Braving the line of fire
Standing tall when duty calls
Taking it down to the wire
Helping a newborn arrive
In the seat of an old squad car
To putting the bad guys away
Walking behind the stars
It's just a piece of medal
Until it's pinned upon a chest
Then it becomes a symbol of America's best
Walking behind the stars
Braving the line of fire
Standing tall when duty calls
Taking it down to the wire
Helping a newborn arrive
In the seat of an old squad car
To putting the bad guys away
Walking behind the stars
