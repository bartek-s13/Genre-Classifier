Today the train pulled out of here that stops in my hometown
And the one I love is waiting for won't be there to step down
Right now they're braidin' rope to hang a man who's not to blame
Back home my love is waitin' she thinks I'm on that train
She'll be there if the sun is shinin' she'll be there if it's pourin' rain
She'll be there with little Jimmy a little man with my last name
But the angry town denied the cry of a stranger's alibi
She's just waitin' for the shattered dream she thinks I'm on that train
My cries out for all the unsaid things I'd like to say
The things I should have done will all be left undone today
I never knew until today that time's a precious thing
Back home my love is waitin' she thinks I'm on that train
She'll be there if the sun is shinin'...
She'll be there if the sun is shinin'...
