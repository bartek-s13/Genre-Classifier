You can spend your whole life buildin', somethin' from nothin'
One storm can come and blow it all away, build it anyway
You can chase a dream, that seems so out of reach
And you know it might not ever come your way, dream it anyway

God is great, but sometimes life ain't good
And when I pray, it doesn't always turn out like I think it should
But I do it anyway
I do it anyway

This world's gone crazy and it's hard to believe
That tomorrow will be better than today, believe it anyway
You can love someone with all your heart, for all the right reasons
And in a moment they can choose to walk away, love 'em anyway

God is great, but sometimes life ain't good
And when I pray, it doesn't always turn out like I think it should
But I do it anyway
Yeah, I do it anyway

You can pour your soul out singin', a song you believe in
That tomorrow they’ll forget you ever sang, sing it anyway
Yeah, sing it anyway, yeah yeah
I sing, I dream, I love anyway, yeah
