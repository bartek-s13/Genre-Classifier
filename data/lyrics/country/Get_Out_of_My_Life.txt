Get out of my life if you don't love me get out of my life and leave me alone
Get out of my life if you don't want me no need to pretend that feeling is gone
Get out of my life and live your own dear don't condemn me I won't condemn you
I was no saint and you were no angel get out of my life let's face that we're through
Get out of my life...
