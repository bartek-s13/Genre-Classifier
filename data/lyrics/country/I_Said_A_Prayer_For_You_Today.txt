My friend I said a prayer for you today and I know God must've heard
I felt the answer in my heart although He spoke no word
I didn't ask for wealth or fame I knew you wouldn't mind
I ask Him to send you treasure's of a far different kind
I asked that He watch over you at the start of each new day
And grant you health and peace and friend to share your way
I asked for happiness for you in all things great and small
But it was for God's loving care I prayed most of all
