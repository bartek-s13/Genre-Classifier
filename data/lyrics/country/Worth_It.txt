Don't tell me I'm too hard to please
That you're worn down from fighting for me
A real man knows what he's signing up for
And if you don't then I'll show myself the door

Cause I'm worth it
You're crazy baby if you think that I don't know it
I ain't afraid to walk away if you can't see it, believe it
And give me the love I'm deserving
Cause I know I'm worth it

Is it too much to look me in the eye
And listen to what I'm saying this time
I'm so tired of being up on your shelf
And if that's what you want
You want somebody else

Cause I'm worth it
You're crazy baby if you think that I don't know it
I ain't afraid to walk away if you can't see it, believe it
And give me the love I'm deserving
Cause I know I'm worth it
Cause I know I'm worth it (worth it)

Don't tell me I'm too hard to please
You should be begging down on your knees

Cause I'm worth it
You're crazy baby if you think that I don't know it
I ain't afraid to walk away if you can't see it, believe it
And give me the love I'm deserving

Cause I know I'm worth it
