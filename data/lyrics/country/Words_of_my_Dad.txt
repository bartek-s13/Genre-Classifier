They say, uh, heart imitates life
And sometimes life imitates heart

Well, she was 6 foot three
She could bench-press me
Had a voice like a young Charley Pride
As she walked up to you
Said, "Honey, how do you do?
I know you ain't here with this guy"

Cause there's a bulldyke hittin' on my girlfriend
Now, I was 'bout to get rowdy and mad
I just kept hearing the words of my dad
"Son, don't ever hit a man on the rack"

Well, she gave you a wink
She bought you a drink
Wrote her phone number down on your hand
She was well on her way
She just hit second base
And I'd 'bout damn had all I could stand

She was flexing her muscles and flicking her bangs
She was lonesome, on'ry and mean

Hey, theres a bulldyke hitting on my girlfriend
I was 'bout to get rowdy and mad
But I just kept on hearing the words of my dad, dear old dad
Said, "don't ever hit a man on the rack"
(Talking)
That smoke just filled up in here
We better get out of here this fuckin' place is on fire
