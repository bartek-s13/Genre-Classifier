Midnight knock
On the front door let you in
We don't talk
Kiss for kiss
We trade this rush again
We can't stop
Yea there's something so narcotic
'Bout how bad I want it
Forget about the price or the pain
I'm just a junky for the fix
Even though it hits
Like a gun shot the next day
Your lips should come with a warnin'
Your touch should have a red light
There's a hard crash comin' in the mornin'
On the bright side this high
Yea that's the side effects of trying to mix
Lovin' what we do
That's the side effects of me and you
Last goodbye, was so damn good
I need it one last time
Yea that's the thing about addicted
You swear your gonna kick it
Till the kiss pulls you back in the flame
Yeaa
Your lips should come with a warnin'
Your touch should have a red light
There's a hard crash comin' in the mornin'
On the bright side this high
Yea that's the side effects of trying to mix
Lovin' what we do
Thats the side effects of me and you
Ohhhh yeaa
Your lips should come with a warnin'
By now you'd think that I would know
Your touch should have a red light
But I still want it every night
Wooowooowow
Your lips should come with a warnin'
Your touch should have a red light
There's a hard crash comin' in the mornin'
On the bright side this high
Yea that's the side effects of trying to mix
Lovin' what we do
That's the side effects of me and you
Yea that's the side effects of trying to mix
Lovin' what we do
That's the side effects of me and you
