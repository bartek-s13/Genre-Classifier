I laid a red rose on your front porch
And wrote 'I love you' on a note
I rang the doorbell and turned to go
Baby when the curtains moved, I couldn't believe the view
I saw the light in your window tonight
I saw two shadows holdin' each other tight
I know the truth, when I look in your eyes
I saw the light in your window tonight
So take your cheatin' hands off my red dress
'Cause I ain't wearin' this thing for you
I see you clearly now and your lies too
They say that love is blind, baby not this time
I saw the light in your window tonight
I saw two shadows holdin' each other tight
I know the truth when I look in your eyes
I saw the light in your window tonight
Why baby why, should I listen to you?
I cry baby cry, now I'm walkin' out the door
They say that love is blind, baby not this time
I saw the light in your window tonight
I saw two shadows holdin' each other tight
I know the truth when I look in your eyes
I saw the light in your window tonight
I know the truth when I look in your eyes
I saw the light in your window tonight
