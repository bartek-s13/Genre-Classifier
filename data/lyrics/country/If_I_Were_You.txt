You're like some kinda lightning
You say all of the right things
You got me coming alive
After all of the hurt I've had

Hate how he's still got me
Blame it on bad timing
You shouldn't come so close
When you're looking at me like that

If I were you
I would be running, I would be leaving now
If I were you I wouldn't look back
Oh, but I want you to
Keep me in the back of your mind
Maybe call me up sometime
In a couple-a years if you haven't found somebody new
That's what I would do
If I were you

You wish I didn't miss him
And I wish I could kiss you
And have you be the only one that I'm thinking about
And I'm not strong enough to
Resist for the both of us
If you stay I'm gonna break your heart
I would make it stop before it starts

If I were you
I would be running, I would be leaving now
If I were you I wouldn't look back
Oh, but I want you to
Keep me in the back of your mind
Maybe call me up sometime
In a couple-a years if you haven't found somebody new
That's what I would do
If I were you

Who could do without you?
Baby, I have no doubt
You'll have found somebody else
By the time I figure it out

That's what I would do, mmm
If I were you

If I were you
I would be running, I would be leaving now
If I were you I wouldn't look back
Oh, but I want you to
Keep me in the back of your mind
Maybe call me up sometime
In a couple-a years if you haven't found somebody new
That's what I would do
If I were you
