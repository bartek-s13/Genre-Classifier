I saw your picture in a paper
Honeymoon in Jamaica, she's a lucky girl
You look so grown up in your black tux, from a ballcap in a pick up Seems like another world
You and me and our big dreams, falling in love
We were two kids in the backseat, all fearless and young

I got the first kiss and she'll get the last
She's got the future, I got the past
I got the class ring, she got the diamond and wedding band
I got the boy, and she got the man

Yeah there's an old you that I knew
Fake IDs to get into those spring break bars
Backwoods on a four wheel, hanging on tight
I can still feel my racing heart
And now you're cleaned up with a hair cut, nice tie and shoes
If things were different and I had a choice, which would I choose?

I got the first kiss and she'll get the last
She's got the future, I got the past
I got the class ring, she got the diamond and wedding band
I got the boy, and she got the man
I got the first kiss and she’ll get the last
We each got something, the other will never have
I got the long hair, hot head
She got the cool and steady hand
I got the boy and she got the man
I got the boy and she got the man
