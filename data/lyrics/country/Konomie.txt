And I wandered near and far
You are me, I am you
Never know just where i was
Until i connected to you
Up above and all around
Stand still, let it breathe
Ain't you all my life's blood
Just feel konomie to me
Chorus:
So blow north wind, blow
Take this trouble take my soul
Heal me, make me whole
Blow north wind, blow
Verse:
I'm still a traveller, here i go
Many places i have seen
When my heart has found it's home
It's just where i'm meant to be
Chorus:
SO blow north wind, blow
Take this trouble take my soul
Heal me, make me whole
Blow north wind blow
Blow north wind blow
Take this trouble take my soul
Heal me make me whole
Blow north wind blow
Blow konomie blow
