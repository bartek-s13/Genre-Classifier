There was a time when I was alone
I was alright by myself
Then you came to me and I began to see what love is about
No one else could know how I love you so
And I can't live without the love you give
Now that you're mine
I will love you till the end of time
The little things you say
Brighten up my day when I'm feelin' blue
Time and time again you have been a friend when I needed you
Then you came to me and I began to see our love that was true
Time and time again you have been a friend when I needed you
There was a time when I was alone
