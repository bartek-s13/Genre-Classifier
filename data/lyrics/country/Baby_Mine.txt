Baby mine
Don't you cry
Baby mine
Dry your eyes
Rest your head close to my heart
Never to part
Baby of mine
Little one
When you play
Don't you mind what they say
Let those eyes sparkle and shine
Never a tear
Baby of mine
If they knew sweet little you
They'd end up loving you, too
All those same people who scold you
What they'd give just for the right to hold you
From your head down to your toes
You're not much
Goodness knows
But you're so precious to me
Sweet as can be, baby of mine
All of those people who scold you
What they'd give just for the right to hold you
From your head down to your toes
You're not much
Goodness knows
But you're so precious to me
Sweet as can be, baby of mine
Baby of mine
