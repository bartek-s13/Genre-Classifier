I'm for law and order, the way that it should be
This song's about the night they spent protecting you from me
Someone called us outlaws in some old magazine
New York sent a posse down like I ain't never seen
Don't you think this outlaw shit has gotten out of hand?
What started out to be a joke, the law don't understand
Was it singing through my nose that got me busted by the man?
This ain't it, this outlaw shit has gotten out of hand, out of hand
We were wrapped up in the music, that's why we never saw
The cars pull up, the boys get out and the room fill up with law
They came pounding through the back door in the middle of my song
They got me for possession of something that was long gone
Don't you think this outlaw shit has gotten out of hand?
What started out to be a joke, the law don't understand
Was it singing through my nose that got me busted by the man?
This ain't it, this outlaw shit has gotten out of hand, out of hand
