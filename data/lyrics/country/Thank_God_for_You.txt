Burnt tire marks, home town streets
Red Trans-Am, bad boy streak
Head held high, little too proud
Turned eighteen, got the hell out
I was ready to show 'em all a thing or two
Thank God for you
Jack on the rocks, Skynyrd bar band
College drop out, no kinda plan
Holes in my boots, one pair of jeans
American girls, Mexican weed
Straight up bound for nowhere, that's the truth
Thank God for you

I thank God there's angels for young wild rebels
Girls who can dance you away from the devil
Make my world spin 'round, the way you do
I thank God for the days just a front porch swinging
Holding your hand, the whole time thinking
How lucky I am
Thank God for you
(Woah)
(Woah)

Pawn shop guitar, turned up loud
Jar full of tips, beer drinking crowd
Feels right at home, up on the stage
Songs about you, and the hell I've raised
I've still got a wild hair or two
Thank God for you

I thank God there's angels for young wild rebels
Girls who can dance you away from the devil
Make my world spin 'round, the way you do
Well I thank God for the days just a front porch swinging
Holding your hand the whole time thinking
How lucky I am
Thank God for you
(woah)
(woah)

I thank God for the days just a front porch swinging
Holding your hand, the whole time thinking
How lucky I am
Thank God for you

Now I hardly know, the man in the mirror
But I kinda like, what you did here
