Well, I'm dreaming about Dixie cotton fields and whippoorwills
Where I spent my happy childhood among the rocks and among the rills
I can see my dear old mommy as around the place she goes
To my home in Louisiana where the old Red River flows

Hi-lee-oh-layoo you can hear the darkies singing soft and low
And at twilight in the evening so soft and low, so low
On my farm in Louisiana where the old Red River flows

Well, the nights are bright on Broadway and the city's bright as day
On the beach at Coney Island where the liquors make you gay
I'm heading south tonight, dear on the IC where she goes
To my home in Louisiana where the old Red River flows
