For all the times you stood by me
Through right and wrong
For being there to catch me when I'd fall
I love you for your faith in me
For all the joys you've given me
But there's one thing makes me love you most of all
You never gave up on me when I was giving love up on you
Every time I thought this love can't work
You stayed to see it through
You never gave up on me when I was making
Things rough on you
And you showed me what it really means to love somebody
And though sometimes we might not see things eye to eye
You've always met me more than half the way
So for all the times I've let you down
And you could have packed your things and gone
I love you most of all because you stayed
And you never gave up on me
When I was giving love up on you
Never mattered who was right or wrong
You stayed to see it through
You never gave up on me
When I was making things rough on you
And you showed me what it really means to love
There were times I just knew you
Did not understand the moods
All those long and sleepless nights I put us through
But you stuck by me anyway
Gave me love everyday
And now there's nothing
In this world I wouldn't do for you
Cause you never gave up on me
When I was giving love up on you
Every time I thought this love can't work
You stayed to see it through
You never gave up on me when
I was making things rough on you
And you showed me what it really means to love
Cause you never gave up on me
When I was giving love up on you
Every time I thought this love can't work
You stayed to see it through
You never gave up on me when I was
Making things rough on you
And you showed me what it really means to love
