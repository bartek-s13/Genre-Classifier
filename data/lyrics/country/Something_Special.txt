We could go down to the lake
Throw off our shoes
Jump into the water like there's nothing to lose
Sky don't get no bluer, love don't get no truer than this
Then you could wrap me in a blanket
And steal a kiss
Then we could go into town
To that little coffee shop
Go sit under the stars, up on the rooftop
Spend an hour talking, watch the people walking by
When the coffee gets colder you can just hold me tight

Something special, something we don't do all the time
Something special, because I am yours and you are mine

A little celebration, just because we can
Walking by your side with my hand in your hand
Make a little history, make the kind of memories that last
Stop and smell the roses
You know they go so fast

Something special, something we don't do all the time
Something special, because I am yours and we can
Go down to the lake throw off our shoes
Jump into the water like there’s nothing to lose
