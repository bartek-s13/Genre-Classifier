A long time forgotten our dreams that just fell by the way
And the good life he promised ain't what she's livin' today
But she never complains of the bad times
Or the bad things he's done, lord
She just talks about the good times they've had
And all the good times to come

She's a good hearted woman in love with a good timin' man
She loves him in spite of his ways that she don't understand
Through teardrops and laughter, they'll pass through this world hand in hand
A good hearted woman, lovin' her good timin' man

He likes the night life and bright lights and good timin' friends
When the party's all over, she'll welcome him back home again
Lord knows she don't understand him
But she does the best that she can
'Cause she's a good hearted woman
She loves her good timin' man

She's a good hearted woman in love with a good timin' man
And she loves him in spite of his wicked ways that she don't understand
Through teardrops and laughter, they'll pass through this world hand in hand
A good hearted woman, lovin' her good timin' man
She's a good hearted woman in love with a good timin' man
She loves me in spite of my wicked ways that she don't understand
Through teardrops and laughter, we'll pass through this world hand in hand, love
A good hearted woman, lovin' her good timin' man
