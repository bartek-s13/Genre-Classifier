I'll always remember
The song they were playing
The first time we danced and I knew
As we swayed to the music
And held to each other
I fell in love with you
Chorus:
Could I have this dance
For the rest of my life
Could you be my partner
Every night
When we're together
It feels so right
Could I have this dance
For the rest of my life
I'll always remember
That magic moment
When I held you close to me
As we move together
I knew forever
You're all I'll ever need
Could I have this dance
For the rest of my life
Could you be my partner
Every night
When we're together
It feels so right
Could I have this dance
For the rest of my life
Could I have this dance
For the rest of my life
Could you be my partner
Every night
When we're together
It feels so right
Could I have this dance
For the rest of my life
