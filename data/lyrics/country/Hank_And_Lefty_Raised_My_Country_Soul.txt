Daddy had a 1949 Ford
When I was just about ten years old
We would listen to 'Hank And Lefty' on the radio
Why don't you love me like you used to do?
And just look what thoughts will do
Old 'Hank And Lefty' raised my country soul
Now I learned how to sing and shuffle my shoes
Listenin' to Hank sing the lovesick blues
We never met old Hank but we was awful close
I cut my teeth on 'Always Late'
And, 'I Love You A Thousand Ways'
Old 'Hank And Lefty' raised my country soul
Daddy said, the hair on his neck would crawl
When old Hank sang about the light he saw
Hank sure put a whole lot of heart in the songs he wrote
Every time daddy got a little bit tight
Mom and dad's waltz would make him cry
Old 'Hank And Lefty' raised my country soul
Now I learned how to sing and shuffle my shoes
Listenin' to Hank sing the lovesick blues
We never met old Hank but we was awful close
Cut my teeth on 'Always Late'
And, 'I Love You A Thousand Ways'
Old 'Hank And Lefty' raised my country soul
Old 'Hank And Lefty' raised my country soul
