Granddaddy was Irish Cherokee
Ran moonshine from here to Tennessee
Spent half his life in the Montgomery county jail
Grandma she got drunk and left
All her kids on her mamas front porch steps
An no ones heard from here since she hightailed
I come from long line of losers
Half outlaw half boozer
I was born with a shot glass in my hand
I'm part hippie a little red neck
I'm always a suspect
My blood line made me who I am
Daddy never finished school
But he played one mean game of pool
Took a bullet for stealin' cars down in Birmingham
Mama always went to church
Soon found out what her reasons were
Got caught at the local Motel with preacher man
I come from long line of losers
Half outlaw half boozer
I was born with a shot glass in my hand
I'm part hippie a little red neck
I'm all ways a suspect
My blood line made me who I am
I come from long line of losers
Half outlaw half boozer
I was born with a shot glass in my hand
I'm part hippee a little red neck
I'm all ways a suspect
My blood line made me who I am
I come from long line of losers
Half outlaw half boozer
I was born with a shot glass in my hand
I'm part hippee a little red neck
I'm all ways a suspect
My blood line made me who I am
