This fruit from the strongest vine
Finest grapes in a glass of wine
Oh baby, time after time
The sweetness is in the struggle
When the sky turns to grey
Don't let the dark blind the way
Love is night and love is day
There's always beauty in the trouble

Rain from heaven, roll on through
Thunder go on, wait for magnolia blooms
Wind and lightning, dust off the avenue
Rain from heaven, wash over me and you

Rivers rise and oceans drop
Don't forget, baby, what we got
Music plays when the needle drops
Through the scars on the vinyl

Rain from heaven, roll on through
Thunder go on, wait for magnolia blooms
Wind and lightning, dust off the avenue
Rain from heaven, wash over me and you

Wash away my troubles
Rain from heaven
Rain from heaven

Rain from heaven, roll on through
Thunder go on, wait for magnolia blooms
Wind and lightning, dust off the avenue
Rain from heaven, wash over me and you
