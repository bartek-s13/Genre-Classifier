Mother nature's opened up the door to lots of things I never saw before
It's a lovely lovely world since I met you
Never did see everything looking so nice I just learned the meaning of paradise
It's a lovely lovely world since I met you
Now the sun shines brighter and the sky'is a little bit bluer
And my little old rattle trap Ford coupe even seems a little bit newer
Well my guitar stays a little better in tune
The stars snine brighter there's honey on the moon
It's a lovely lovely world since I met you
Ever since you cuddled in my embrace I've had more fate in the human race
It's a lovely lovely world since I met you
Now I don't mind working or slaving all day
Cause I know tonight there'll be love to pay
It's a lovely lovely world since I met you
Everything seems nutural and right since the day I found you
Everything looks rosy and shiny bright in the dreams I'm building around you
Used to think that miracles would never come true
But now I'm happy cause I know they do
It's a lovely lovely world since I met you
