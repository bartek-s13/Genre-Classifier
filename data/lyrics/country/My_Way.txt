There's a kind of lovin' that don't take much
It'll leave you colder than a stranger's touch
Some guys will lie late at night
Then they're gone by morning light
Well that ain't my way
Baby sure enough if you look my way
You'll find my love
Strong as an oak
Solid as a pine
It shines like the stars above
My way is moonlit nights
Sunny days and treating you right
You may have been in love before
But not my way
There's a kind of man
Knows all the lines
The body language
The zodiac signs
It's a cold cold game and he plays to win
But there's always a loser when that game ends
Well that ain't my way
Baby sure enough if you look my way
You'll find my love
Strong as an oak
Solid as a pine
It shines like the stars above
My way is moonlit nights
Sunny days and treating you right
You may have been in love before
But not my way
Well that ain't my way
Baby sure enough if you look my way
You'll find my love
Strong as an oak
Solid as a pine
It shines like the stars above
My way is moonlit nights
Sunny days and treating you right
You may have been in love before
But not my way
Well you may have been in love before
But not my way
(My way)
My way
