I can't hide the way I feel about you
Anymore
I can't hold the hurt inside, keep the pain out of my eyes
Anymore

My tears no longer waiting
My resistance ain't that strong
My mind keeps recreating
A life with you alone
And I'm tired of pretending
I don't love you anymore

Let me make one last appeal to show you how I feel
About you (Mhm)
'Cause there's no one else, I swear, holds a candle anywhere
Next to you (Mmm-hmm)

My heart can't take the beating
Not having you to hold
A small voice keeps repeating
Deep inside my soul
It says I can't keep pretending
I don't love you anymore
I've got to take the chance or let it pass by
If I expect to get on with my life

My tears no longer waiting
Oh, my resistance ain't that strong
But my mind keeps recreating
A life with you alone
And I'm tired of pretending
I don't love you anymore

Anymore
