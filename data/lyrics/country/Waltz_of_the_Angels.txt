The waltz of the angels the moonlight and you
The waltz of the angels I hear each time I hold you tightly in these arms of mine
It's surely from heaven this music I hear
When your lips say I love you in waltz time my dear
There must be a power much higher than I a writer of love songs way up in the sky
The maker of roses of love sweet and true
And the waltz of the angels the moonlight and you
Oh hurry my darling to my waiting arms I'll love you forever and keep you from harm
We know love is endless our hearts have been kissed
By the waltz of the angels and far beyond this
There must be a power much higher than I a writer of love songs way up in the sky
The maker of roses of love sweet and true
And the waltz of the angels he wrote just for you
