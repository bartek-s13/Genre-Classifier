Alright

My baby told me she didn't love me
So here i am down in Mexico
In Rosarito Rio Cantina
Working on my espanol

Mas tequila porfavor
Do I like it si senor
Mi amigo pour some more
Mas tequila porfavor
My poor liver feels like that river
But i'm not sure I'm over her or not
So we're gonna stay here
Me and Jose here
And give it just one more shot

Mas tequila porfavor
Do I like it si senor
Mi amigo pour some more
Mas tequila porfavor
Now I don't want no cold cerveza
I don't want sangria wine
All I want is what goes great with
A broken heart a shake of salt
And a slice of wine

Mas taquila
Mas tequila porfavor
Do I like it si senor
Mi amigo pour some more
Mas tequila porfavor
Do I like it si senor
Mi amigo pour some more
Mas tequila porfavor
Nah she don't love me anymore
Mas tequila porfavor
