Is it a wheat field behind a fence line
A 12 gauge pepper on a road sign
Is it a dirt road, off the blacktop
Deadman’s name beside a map dot
Is it a mail box, says your last name
The lonesome rumble of the coal train
Is it a dust cloud, behind a John Deere
And knowing you’re never gonna leave here
It’s who I am
It’s who we are
That’s what makes
A country heart
And it’s the sum
Of all it’s parts
That’s what makes
A country heart
Is it the grey ink in a tattoo
You hid from your momma back in high school
Is it your first beer or your first car
Old war stories from your Grandpa
Is it your first love on your first date
Stealing a kiss up on the tailgate
Is it a handshake from her old man
Buying a ring and making big plans
It’s who I am
It’s who we are
That’s what makes
A country heart
And it’s the sum
Of all it’s parts
That’s what makes
A country heart
Is it the long days starting sunrise
Feeling alone under a big sky
Is it the diesel, or the barbed wire
Breaking your back to fight a bushfire
Is it the new grass after a big flood
Trying to be half the man your dad was
Is it in the blood, is it in the genes
Hard work, love and all that makes me
Who I am
It’s who we are
That’s what makes
A country heart
And it’s the sum
Of all it’s parts
That’s what makes
A country heart
Yeah that’s what makes
A country heart , A country heart
