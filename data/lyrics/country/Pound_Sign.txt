Dog-tired, yeah, I'm wired
Uptight-er than an a-string about to break
Tail-draggin', a little ragged
Hangin' by a thread that's startin' to fray

Just in case there might be little ears around
I won't say it, I'll just spell it out

I feel like pound-sign, question mark, star, exclamation point
Don't give a blank and a whole lot of other
Choice words I can't say, today I feel like
Pound-sign, question mark, star, exclamation point

Hung-over, a lot closer
To ringin' death's door than I was yesterday
Head-achin', hand-shakin'
Badly in need of a shower and shave

Yeah, I know I'm lookin'
A little rough
The least I can do
Is clean my language up
I feel like pound-sign, question mark, star, exclamation point
Don't give a blank and a whole lot of other
Choice words I can't say, today I feel like
Pound-sign, question mark, star, exclamation point

I think I partied
A little too hard last night
Let's see here now
How do I put this right?

I feel like pound-sign, question mark, star, exclamation point
Don't give a blank and a whole lot of other
Choice words I can't say, today I feel like
Pound-sign, question mark, star, exclamation point

Don't give a blank and a whole lot of other
Choice words I can't say, today I feel like
Pound-sign, question mark, star, exclamation point
Percentage sign, at symbol, back-slash, squiggle-thing
Pound-sign, question mark, star, exclamation point
