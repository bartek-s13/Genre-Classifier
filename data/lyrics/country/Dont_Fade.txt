Let's put it into wax
Pray for it every day
So when we're lookin' back
The memory stays the same
Don't fade
I don't want to turn the page
Put it in a frame
Lock it up and keep it safe
I hope I don't ever have to forget
You and me just like this
Every inch of this kiss
Don't fade
Let's put it in a song
So when this night is gone
I can turn it up
I can sing along
Don't fade
I don't want to turn the page
Put it in a frame
Lock it up and keep it safe
I hope I don't ever have to forget
You and me just like this
Every inch of this kiss
Don't fade
Don't fade
I don't want to turn the page
Tuck it away
Lock it up and keep it safe
And I hope I don't ever have to forget
I'd play it time and time again
A song that's spinnin' in my head
Words I hadn't written yet
And it's somethin' that I've been dreamin' about
Holdin' on to you right now
You &amp; me, just like this
Every inch of this kiss
Don't fade
