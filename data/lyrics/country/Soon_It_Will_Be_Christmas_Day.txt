Hear the children how they're a singing now everybody's happy and gay
All of the stockings are hung with care soon it will be Christmas Day
Tiny silver bells are a ringing up hanging on out as they sway
Songs of the carolers fill the air soon it will be Christmas Day
At every house you'll find the window with a Christmas tree
And all the boys and girls are just as good as they can be
Cause Santa's reindeer soon will be swinging up bringing lots of presents their way
All the excitements are hard to bear it will be Christmas Day
At every house you'll find the window...
