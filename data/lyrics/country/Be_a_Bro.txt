Ooh Ooh, Ooh Ooh

If she got lipstick on her teeth, then you tell her
She looking like a hot mess, you don’t let her
Take that show on the road out the door
If she got shit on her shirt, let her borrow yours
You don’t date her brother, don’t date her cousin
Don’t date that guy she really likes, even if she says she doesn’t
Cause she does and you know that she does, yeah (yeah)

Cause life is tough enough
You gotta show a little love
Sometimes I mess it up, but here’s what I know-ow, oh
If you hold a sister down
It’ll all come back around
So, be a bro
Know the girl code

Ooh Ooh (be a bro bro)
Ooh (know the girl code) Ooh (be a bro bro)

If she need her hair tied, give her your hair tie
Never post a picture of her if it’s on her bad side
You agree when she says her ex is nuts
Even if he’s pretty cool, you gotta hate his guts cause
Cause life is tough enough
You gotta show a little love
Sometimes I mess it up, but here’s what I know-ow, oh
If you hold a sister down
It’ll all come back around
So, be a bro
Know the girl code

Bitches gotta stick together
Like velcro on a wool sweater, yeah yeah yeah
Bitches gotta stick together
Remember remember oh oh
Life is tough enough, so show a little love
Yeah, we all mess it up but here’s what I know
Oh woah ohh

If you hold a sister down
It’ll all come back around
So, be a bro (be a bro, be a bro yeah)
Know the girl code
Cause life is tough enough
You gotta show a little love
Sometimes I mess it up, but here’s what I know-ow, oh
If you hold a sister down
It’ll all come back around
So, be a bro
Know the girl code
Know the girl code
Be a bro bro (Be a bro bro)
Yeah, Know the girl code
Know the girl code
