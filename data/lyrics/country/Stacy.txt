Twenty-five times he's hit decline
On his cell phone
Quit driving by 'cause you cry every time
When he ain't home
I know you saw a diamond ring
Babies and an SUV
Bless your little broken heart
And how you fall apart

Aw, Stacy, why you gotta be so crazy
Honey, don't you thnk that maybe
You're the one to blame for running them boys away
Aw, Stacy, poor little someone come and save me
Ain't it something sad
When girls like you make women like me look bad

You ought to be out on the town running round
With your girlfriends
Instead here you sit with your fist in a clinch
Like an old hen
Gotta get a grip on yourself
Girl, you're getting hard to help
Happens every time
You find a man and lose your mind

Aw, Stacy, why you gotta be so crazy
Honey, don't you thnk that maybe
You're the one to blame for running them boys away
Aw, Stacy, poor little someone come and save me
Ain't it something sad
When girls like you make women like me look bad


Aw, Stacy, why you gotta be so crazy
Honey, don't you thnk that maybe
You're the one to blame for running them boys away
Aw, Stacy, poor little someone come and save me
Ain't it something sad
When girls like you make women like me look bad
Don't you know it's girls like you
Who make women like me look bad

Aw, Stacy
Poor little Stacy
Crazy cracy Stacy
Everybody knows a Stacy
