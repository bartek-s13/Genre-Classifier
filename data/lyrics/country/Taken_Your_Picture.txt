Got one of you and me, tequila on the beach
That one just stays on my dash
A couple in my phone with not a lot on
That you thought I had to have
But the one I didn't get
Is the one I don't wanna forget

We were watching that sunlight fade
You were sittin' on the porch at my place
Kind of playing with the tear in your jeans
Your eyes kind of cutting right through me
One looked like a thousand words
With a smile so sweet that it hurts
Should've leaned in, should've kissed you
I should've taken your picture
I should've taken your picture

And if I knew then what I know now
Girl, I wouldn't play it so cool
I'd breathe it all in, every little bit
Would've got somethin' I can hold onto
And never let it go (Never let her go)
Oh, you know I could never let it go, no

We were watching that sunlight fade
You were sittin' on the porch at my place
Kind of playing with the tear in your jeans
Your eyes kind of cutting right through me
One looked like a thousand words
With a smile so sweet that it hurts
Should've leaned in, should've kissed you
I should've taken your picture

Hoo, hoo, hoo
Oh, wish that I could rewind
How was I supposed to know it'd be your last time?

We were watching that sunlight fade
You were sittin' on the porch at my place
Kind of playing with the tear in your jeans
Your eyes kind of cutting right through me
One looked like a thousand words
With a smile so sweet that it hurts
Should've leaned in, should've kissed you
I should've taken your picture
'Cause it hurts bad when it hits you
I should've taken your picture, mmh

I should've taken your picture, oh no, oh no, oh no
Oh yeah, I should've taken your picture, mmh
