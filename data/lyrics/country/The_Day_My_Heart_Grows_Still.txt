Yes, I know
Well, I know I will, I will
Love you 'til the day my heart goes still
Until they put me in the ground up on some hill
I don't think I'll ever get my fill
I'm gonna love you 'til the day my heart goes still

When I was younger
Lord knows I tried, I tried
I wish that I had somebody by my side
There were times I thought I'd get lost in fold
But you lived your life so fearlessly and bold
I'm gonna love you 'til the day my blood runs cold

Yes, I know
Well, I know I will, I will
Love you 'til the day my heart goes still
Until they put me in the ground up on some hill
I don't think I'll ever get my fill
I'm gonna love you 'til the day my heart goes still

Now I ain't no young girl
But this I know, I know
I still got a long, long way to go
But if the good Lord should come knockin' at my door
I had everything I wanted and more
And if there's hell to pay when we settle up the score
I can always say I lived my life my way
No tomorrow for mistakes I made today
I don't think I'll ever get my fill
I don't think I'll ever get my fill
I don't think I'm ever gonna get my fill
I'm gonna love you 'til the day my heart goes still
