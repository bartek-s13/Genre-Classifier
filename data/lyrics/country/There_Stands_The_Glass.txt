There stands the glass that will ease all my pain
That will settle my brain it's my first one today
There stands the glass that will hide all my tears
That will drown all my fear brother I'm on my way
I'm wondering where you are tonight I'm wondering if you are all right
I wonder if you think of me in my misery
There stands the glass fill it up to the brim
Till my troubles grow dim it's my first one today
I'm wondering where you are tonight...
