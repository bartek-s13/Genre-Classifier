It's about style
It's about cool
Long haired trucker caps and country roots
Yeah it's a feeling that you get
From suicide doors and Johnny Cash, yeah

It's about real
It's about smoove
That flat black and them speakers boom
It's slow
It's fast
If you're gonna roll, roll in a Cadillac

Fuzzy dice on the mirror
Cooler in the back full of beer
Radio bumping a little bits something that sounds like cheap sunglasses
Catching every girls eye
As we roll on by
Horns on the hood looking damn good
Cadillacin'

It's about four rings of fire
Them white wall spinning, smoking tires
It's about giving her a ride
She got a thumb in the air, yeah she knows what I got
She wants to slide right in my TC-3
On a Saturday night in them leather seats
Heads bopping back and forth to the beat, yeah alright
Fuzzy dice on the mirror
Cooler in the back full of beer
Radio bumping a little bits something that sounds like cheap sunglasses
Catching every girls eye
As we roll on by
Horns on the hood looking damn good
Cadillacin'
