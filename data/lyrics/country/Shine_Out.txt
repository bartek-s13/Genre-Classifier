Sky ain't fading to black
Sun is settin' deep
Nothin' to hear but my
Well, my lonesome heart beat
Not a whisper of wind
And no moon in the sky
Just airplane lights and stars
Of a thousand times
Let the light shine out
And never come back around
I'll just sit here tonight
And think about
All of those times that we had it out
Let the light shine out
Gravel roads and city streets
Always lead you to me
You just stop there in your tracks
And turn the car around
Then you burn the ground
Well let the light shine out
And never come back around
I'll just sit here tonight
And think about
All of those times that we had it out
Let the light
Oh grass will burn it'll grow again
Greener than it was, than it's ever been
Just gotta give it time
Oh love is true but not for you
And not for me it's easy to see
We'll just let it be
Let the light shine out
And never come back around
I'll just sit here tonight
And think about
All of those times that we had it out
Let the light shine out
Let the light shine out
