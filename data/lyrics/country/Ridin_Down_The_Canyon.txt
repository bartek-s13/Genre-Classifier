When evening chores are over at our ranch house on the plains
And all I have got to do is lay around
I saddle up my pony and go ridin' down the trail
To watch the desert sun go down
Ridin' down the canyon to watch the sun go down
A picture that no artist 'ere could paint
White faced cattle lowing on the mountain side
I hear a coyote whining for its mate
Cactus plants are blooming, sage brush everywhere
Granite spires are standing all around
I tell you folks it's heaven to be riding down the trail
When the desert sun goes down
