Rosalita, my little rose of the rancho
You won my heart down by the rio
Dry your eyes, dear, and don't be blue, Anita
I'll come back to you my little Rosalita

Each night I tell the moon on high and all its glory
Of you and I and days gone by and love's sweet story

Rosalita another day, now, is dawning
For you I'm longing Rosalita

Each night I tell the moon on high and all its glory
Of you and I and days gone by and love's sweet story
Rosalita another day, now, is dawning
For you I'm longing Rosalita

Rosalita another day, now, is dawning
For you I'm longing Rosalita
