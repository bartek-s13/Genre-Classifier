I still recall the morning that I met you
Standing out in front of Wilson's five and dime
Staring through the window at the jewelry
Hungry for the things you couldn't buy
Just like a fool I thought that I could please you
I saw you had an eye for things that shine
I paid seven sawmill dollars for a bracelet
Just to satisfy your fourteen carat mind
Layin' by these railroad tracks in Denver
With a hurtin' head and a half a pint of wine
Everything except my soul has been surrendered
Just to satisfy your fourteen carat mind
The cabin that I built in West Virginia
Was not enough to keep you satisfied
'Cause a man that's got a sawmill occupation
Can't afford to feed a rich girl's appetite
I wonder if you're still with Willie Jackson
Sometimes I wonder if he's still alive
Ol' Willie he gave up his wife and children
Just to satisfy your fourteen carat mind
Layin' by these railroad tracks in Denver
With a hurtin' head and a half a pint of wine
Everything except my soul has been surrendered
Just to satisfy your fourteen carat mind
