Well
I'm an eight-ball shooting double fisted drinking son-of-a-gun
I wear my jeans a little tight
Just to watch the little boys come undone
I'm here for the beer
And the ball-busting band
Gonna get a little crazy just because I can

You know I'm here for the party
And I ain't leaving till they throw me out
Gonna have a little fun gonna get me some
You know I'm here
I'm here for the party

I may not be a ten
But the boys say I clean up good
And if I gave 'em half a chance for some rowdy romance
You know they would
I've been waiting all week just to have a good time
So bring on them cowboys
And their pick up lines

[Bridge:
Don't want no purple hooter shooter
Just some Jack on the rocks
Don't mind me if I start that trashy talk
