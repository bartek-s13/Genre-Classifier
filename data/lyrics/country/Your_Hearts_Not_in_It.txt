I never wanted anyone as much as I want you tonight
It would feel so good to feel your touch
And to let you hold me tight
If it was only right
But your heart's not in it
And I can't take your body if
Your heart's not in it
There's an old love on your mind
That you just can't forget
At least you haven't yet
No, your heart's not in it
And I won't gamble on a love
If I can't win it
And I can't win it
If your heart's not in it
I wish I thought that you'd be loving me
If I gave my love to you
I'd close my eyes and I'd set my feelings free
If you only love me too
I wish you loved me too
But your heart's not in it
And I can't take your body if
Your heart's not in it
There's an old love on your mind
That you just can't forget
At least you haven't yet
No, your heart's not in it
And I won't gamble on a love
If I can't win it
And I can't win it
If your heart's not in it
No, your heart's not in it
And I won't gamble on a love
If I can't win it
And I can't win it
If your heart's not in it
No your heart's no in it
