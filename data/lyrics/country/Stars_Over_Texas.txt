As you lie in my arms, girl, my heart's on my sleeve
Words come so hard in moments like these
There's feelings I have that are so hard to show
But right now there's one thing I want you to know

As long as the tides ebb, the earth turns, the sun sets
I promise I'll always be true
And as long as there's stars over Texas
Darlin', I'll hang the moon for you

I know I have stumbled and caused you some tears
When you needed me most I haven't always been here
I know I'm not always the man I should be
But don't ever wonder what you mean to me

As long as the tides ebb, the earth turns, the sun sets
I promise I'll always be true
And as long as there's stars over Texas
Darlin', I'll hang the moon for you

And as long as there's stars over Texas
Darlin', I'll hang the moon for you
Darlin', I'll hang the moon for you
