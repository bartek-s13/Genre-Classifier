Whatever happened to a feeling bad song?
Lost the best damn woman, that you ever had song
It's all four wheel drive, and jacked up tires, and rolling out with them speakers
But for a trip down memory lane tonight, I need something a little deeper

Than S10 Chevy's or F150's
Flatbed, Dodge Ram, dirt road ditties
Headlights, tailights, daddy's Eldorado
Dashboards, ditches, or silver Silverado's
Down by the lake or down by the river
Mud bank, no thanks
I'm just gonna sit here, and miss her
So mister, here's my 20 bucks
Don't play no songs about trucks

Most nights I don't really mind 'em
With the windows down, hell I might even rewind 'em
But since my heart got broke
I don't wanna drive around
Just wanna let this heartache soak up a sadder sound


Or trailers, or tailgates, or tractors
I'm gettin' drunk, but not in a pasture
This bar stool is right where I'll stay stuck

Yeah, have another beer
But I don't wanna hear
No songs about trucks
No, no, no
No more songs about trucks
No, no, no, no, no
