I cheat 'cause I lie
I lie 'cause I steal
I steal because my heart is good as buried in a field
It's food for the flowers
In God's honest truth
Even the wild roses are blue

I drink because I smoke
I smoke because there's fire
A flame unquenchable burns higher and higher
My love is long gone
A love I thought was true
Now even the wild roses are blue

In my dreams (Dreams, dreams)
You reach out for me
In my dreams (Dreams, dreams)
I reach out for you

And I wake up crying
There's nothing I can do
And even the wild roses are blue
The river is long
The valley is dry
The birds, they don't sing
They just hang their heads and cry
It's lonesomest sound
Now, how do I get through?
When even the wild roses are blue

In my dreams (Dreams, dreams)
You reach out for me
In my dreams (Dreams, dreams)
I reach out for you

I wake up crying
There's nothing I can do
Even the wild roses are blue
Even the wild roses are blue

I cheat 'cause I lie
I lie 'cause I steal
And I steal because my heart's been buried in a field
