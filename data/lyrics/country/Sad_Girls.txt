Hotels, midnight
Blue dress, black tie
Sad girls, red lights
White lies, red wine

You can't jump out of the car right now
'Cause it's too damn far to walk alone
His hand on the wheel while the rain comes down
And you don't have a cigarette to smoke
And the way he says he's sorry
Makes you feel so small
So small

Tears from closed eyes
One kiss, goodbye
You tell yourself you're gonna be alright
White lies, red wine

And you can't jump out of the car right now
'Cause it's too damn far to walk alone
His hand on the wheel while the rain comes down
And you don't have a cigarette to smoke
And the way he says he's sorry
Makes you feel so small

Small enough to get out from under it
Lonely enough to wanna find something better
If it were a movie, the music would swell
And you'd slam the door and tell him to go to hell
But you won't, 'cause it's not

You can't jump out of the car right now
'Cause it's too damn far to walk alone
His hand on the wheel while the rain comes down
And you don't have a cigarette to smoke
And the way he says he's sorry
Makes you feel so small
So small

Hotels, midnight
Blue dress, black tie
