While putting some new strings on my old guitar
I know just what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna sit down and write me a song
And I'm gonna sing it to you

I realize now after all those hard times
And Lord knows we've had us a few
Together forever, where ever we are
I couldn't be me without you

I couldn't be me without you
I couldn't be me without you
Together forever, where ever we are
I couldn't be me without you
I couldn't be me without you
I couldn't be me without you
Together forever, where ever we are
I couldn't be me without you
