If you get out in the drivin' rain
Stand in the eye of a hurricane
And never think twice
If you turn your back on selfishness
And your thoughts are for someone else
'Cause they've changed your life
Chorus:
That's how you know it's love
That's how you know it's meant to be
When the span of forever
Just never seems long enough
That's how you know it's love
When your heart insists that you give it all
When you no longer fear the fall
And you just let it go
When the past is finally dead and gone
Fate leads you somewhere to the one
That has your soul
Chorus
No part of you questions
No part of you doubts
You're only sure this is what loves about
And nothing and no one can stand in your way
Or keep you from saying what your heart is dying to say
Chorus
