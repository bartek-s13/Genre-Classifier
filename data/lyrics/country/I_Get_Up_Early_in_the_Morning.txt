When Christopher Columbus returned to Spain
The wise men asked him would you please explain
How'd you know the world was round he said I used my brain
And I get up early in the morning
Well get up and get up when the sun comes up
Don't lay there dozin' like a lazy pup
Health and wealth will overflow your cup
If you get up early in the morning
Andrew Jackson fought the British down in New Orleans
And he sent them runnin' through the turnip greens
When they wondered how he did it he said were just mean
And I get up early in the morning
They asked Casanova uh man what you got
That makes all the women think that you're so hot
He said well my little secret boys believe it or not
Is I get up early in the morning
