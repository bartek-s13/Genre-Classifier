Sometimes I think this world's too much
All the hurt, all the hate, all it takes is a human touch
It's so easy to get lost in the light
Make a change, make a choice, all the noise, we can drown it out

Meet me out where the stars turn blue, come on
Touch the sky and enjoy the view
So come here, make it all disappear like lovers do
Girl, for you, I wish that I could build a world for two
Girl, for you, I wish that I could build a world for two

Kiss me like there's no one else for miles
Take it fast, take it slow, letting go for a little while
Heaven's so close to the both of us
For the rest of the night we can fly, we can rise above

Meet me out where the stars turn blue, come on
Touch the sky and enjoy the view
So come here, make it all disappear like lovers do
Girl, for you, I wish that I could build a world for two
Girl, for you, I wish that I could build a world for two (Oh)
Girl, for you (I'd build a world)
For two (I'd build a world)
Girl, for you (I'd build a world)
For two, yeah

Meet me out where the stars turn blue, come on
Touch the sky and enjoy the view
So come here, make it all disappear like lovers do
Girl, for you, I wish that I could build a world for two
Meet me out where the stars turn blue, come on
Touch the sky and enjoy the view
So come here, make it all disappear like lovers do
Girl, for you, I wish that I could build a world for two
Girl, for you, I wish that I could build a world for two
