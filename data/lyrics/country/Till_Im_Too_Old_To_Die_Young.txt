If life is like a candle bright death must be the wind
You can close your window tight and it still comes flowing in
So I will climb the highest hill and watch the rising sun
And I pray that I don't feel the chill till I'm too old to die young
CHORUS
Let me watch my children grow to see what they become
Oh Lord don't let that cold wind blow till I'm too old to die young
Now I have had some dear sweet friends I thought would never die
Now the only thing that's left of them is the teardrops in my eyes
If I could have one wish today and know it would be done
Well I would say everyone could stay till they're too old to die young
REPEAT CHORUS TWICE
