All the times I doubted myself
All the stories that I could tell
Wouldn’t stand in front of a crowd
Or say my thoughts too loud
But there’s a fire, desire, that burns me up
For once in my life I’m ready to jump
I’m falling fearless
No other way to do this
‘Cause even when I’m crashing down
There is higher ground
I’m falling fearless
No other way to do this
‘Cause even when I’m coming down
It’s so much better now
I’m falling fearless
All my demons made me who I am
Hold my breath and let it in
All the struggles lead me to a plan
Driving forward with no hands
There’s a fire, desire, that burns me up
For once in my life I’m ready to jump
I’m falling fearless
No other way to do this
‘Cause even when I’m crashing down
There is higher ground
I’m falling fearless
No other way to do this
Cause even when I’m coming down
It’s so much better now
I’m falling fearless
I’m falling fearless
I’m falling fearless
Fearless
