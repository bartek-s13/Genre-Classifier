In Alamogordo, New Mexico just a few years ago
While the nations of this world were at war
America's greatest men were workin' hard then
On the things that had never been before
When the Lord held out His mighty hand
So that others in this world might understand
That wars could never be and this world it must be free
When they found the mighty, mighty Atomic Power
They were at Los Alamos, Oak Ridge and old Pasco
Working in a downpour of rain
In that zero hour seeking out some heavenly power
While the Star Spangled Banner was being played
When the Lord held out His mighty hand
So that others in this world might understand
That wars could never be and this world it must be free
When they found the mighty, mighty Atomic Power
Then a flash, a rumbling roar out across the desert floor
They had found the atomic power from above
Then God with His mighty hand showed the world it could not stand
When they found the mighty, mighty Atomic Power
When the Lord held out His mighty hand
So that others in this world might understand
That wars could never be and this world it must be free
When they found the mighty, mighty Atomic Power
