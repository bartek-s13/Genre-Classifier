Who's gonna give a middle finger to the man
Give a damn about Jesus and Jones
Who's gonna fight, turn a wrong into right, throw a punch when your back's to the wall
Who's gonna drive them old trucks?
Who're you gonna call when you're stuck?

Outlaws like us
Yeah, we're still around
We spit, fight and cuss and run one-stoplight towns
We ain't got much
It's more than enough to make a girl fall in love
With outlaws like us

We drink our beer, five o-clock, two for one in some bar where they know our last name
We stand our ground living high, we was raised, raise 'em up boys
Cause we ain't ashamed
We still got pride in the South
We don't let that flag hit the ground

Outlaws like us
Yeah, we're still around
We spit, fight and cuss and run one-stoplight towns
We ain't got much
It's more than enough to make a girl fall in love
With outlaws like us
Well, buddy don't try pushing us
Cause we still got guns in our trucks

Outlaws like us
Yeah, we're still around
We spit, fight and cuss and run one-stoplight towns
We ain't got much
It's more than enough to make a girl fall in love
With outlaws like us
Yeah, we're still around
We spit, fight and cuss and run one-stoplight towns
We ain't got much
It's more than enough to make a girl fall in love
With outlaws like us
Outlaws like us
Yeah, outlaws like us
Outlaws like us

Who's gonna give a middle finger to a man to the man
Give a damn about Jesus and Jones
