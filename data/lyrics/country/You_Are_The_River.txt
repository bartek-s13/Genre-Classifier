I fall into you, get pulled along
Dragged out to sea before too long
Funny how it’s me who made you strong
You are the river and I’m the rain
You’ll flood your banks, you’ll take out towns
I dove in, swearing I won’t drown
If only I could just slow you down
You are the river, and I’m the rain
We’re just too much now, too much now
I guess we’re both to blame
No I don’t know how, I don’t know how to stay away…
I never know just when to stop
You swell with pride till your levees drop
A hurricane, oh all was lost
You are the river and I’m the rain
We’ll never change
Try to wish us away, Love
Oh but I know better
We’re a perfect storm
It’s just how we’re made
I fall, you run…
We’re just too much now, too much now
It’ll always be that way
I don’t know how, I don’t know how we’ll ever change
You’re the river and I am the rain
You are the river and I am the rain
