Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

No, I can't stay
I gotta hit the road
Sometime life teach you a lesson
That makes you cold (Cold!)

Hell, I gave her everything, even down to my last sin
And she just took my heart and ran away with it
She gave me life (Life!)
And told me everything would be perfect
But it ain't right (Right!)
Don't even know if it was worth it

You gotta strap up your boots, get your feelings aligned
Yeah, I'll be alright, yeah, I'll be alright
Gotta get in your mood, thank God I'm alive
Yeah, I'll be alright, yeah, I'll be alright

Eeny, meeny, meeny, meeny, miny, moe
I'll never, ever, ever let her take my soul
Eeny, meeny, meeny, meeny, miny, moe
Don't aim too high, don't shoot too low
Eeny, meeny, meeny, meeny, miny, moe
Everything that live gon' grow
Gotta get it while we're on the go
Bless the hearts that try to take my soul

Now, I can't wait (What?)
I gotta make a move (Move!)
Sometimes you find yourself in places
That makes you cross

Hell, I gave her everything, even down to my last sin, yeah
She paired up with Satan and they became the best of friends
She fed me life
And told me everything would be perfect
But it ain't right
Don't even know if it was worth it

Eeny, meeny, meeny, meeny, miny, moe
Said you jumped on a plane, but you jumped the broom
Well, you left your feelings with the honeymoon
Yeah, you left your feelings with the honeymoon
Eeny, meeny, meeny, meeny, miny, moe
Said you dropped your feelings when you left her cold
She was playin' with your heart, tryna get your gold
Playin' with your heart, tryna get your gold

You gotta strap up your boots, get your feelings aligned
Yeah, I'll be alright, yeah, I'll be alright
Gotta get in your mood, thank God I'm alive
Yeah, I'll be alright, yeah, I'll be alright

Eeny, meeny, meeny, meeny, miny, moe
I'll never, ever, ever let her take my soul
Eeny, meeny, meeny, meeny, miny, moe
Don't aim too high, don't shoot too low
Eeny, meeny, meeny, meeny, miny, moe
Everything that live gon' grow
Gotta get it while we're on the go
Bless the hearts that try to take my soul

Sometimes you find yourself alone, and
You need someone by your side, but
They're just not the right one
So you gotta move on, and live life

You gotta strap up your boots, get your feelings aligned
Yeah, I'll be alright, yeah, I'll be alright
Gotta get in your mood, thank God I'm alive
Yeah, I'll be alright, yeah, I'll be alright

Woo, woo
Woo, woo
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
