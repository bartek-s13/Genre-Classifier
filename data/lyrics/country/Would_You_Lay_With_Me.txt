Would you lay-ay wi-ith me in a fie-ield o-of sto-one
If my needs were strong, would you lay-ay wi-ith me
Should my lips grow-ow dry, would you wet them dear
In the midnight hour, if my lips were-ere dry
Would you go a-away to another-er land
Walk a thousand miles through the burni-in' sand
Wipe the blood a-away from my dyin' ha-and
If I give my-yself to-oo you
Will you bathe wi-ith me in the strea-eam o-of life
When the moon is full, will you ba-athe wi-ith me
Will you still lo-ove me, when I'm down and out
In my time of trial will you sta-and by-why me
Would you go a-away to anothe-er land
Walk a thousand miles through the burni-in' sand
Wipe the blood a-away from my dyin' ha-and
If I give my-yself to you
Would you lay wi-ith me in a field of sto-one
(Would you lay with me in a field of stone)
Should my lips grow dry, would you wet them dear-ear
(Should my lips grow dry, would you wet them dear)
Will you bathe wi-ith me in the strea-eam of life
(Will you bathe wi-ith me in the strea-eam of life)
Will you still lo-ove me, when I'm down and out
