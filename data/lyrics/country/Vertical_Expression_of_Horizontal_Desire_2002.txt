When she asked me to dance I said, No No...."I have two left feet."
And the she took my hand and whispered a song so sweet
And she said, "Hold me as close as you can 'til my bodies on fire."
It's just a vertical expression of horizontal desire
Nuestro amor se contó*
Como el agua sobre el acero
Y no puedo explicar
La manera como te quiero
Y la música toca
El calor aumenta más alto
Es una vértica expresión
Un deseo horizontal
(Given below is the english transalation of the above )
So we moved like water bein' poured over polished steel
And I really can't translate the way she made me feel
And the music played on and the mercury just went higher
It's just a vertical expression of horizontal desire
We did the samba, the mambo
The tango, the two-step while we romanced
Con el compás abrazando
Nos fuimos sin saber por qué
(Given below is the english transalation of the above )
And when the music got fast
We just held to each other and slow danced
I took nothing for granted but I wished I could stay all night
Y al llegar a su casa ella apagó la luz
(Given below is the english transalation of the above )
And as we walked in to her place she reached out to dim the light
She said, "Dance with me darlin' 'til the moon and the stars retire."
It's just a vertical expression of horizontal desire
Es una vértica expression un deseo horizontal
(Given below is the english transalation of the above )
It's just a vertical expression of horizontal desire...
