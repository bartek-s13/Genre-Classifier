Ain't done one single thing this morning except of crying all alone
Ain't had no lovin' since you've been gone
And I ain't gonna get no lovin' till you come home
Nothin's been the same since you've left me everything has gone from right to wrong
Ain't had no lovin' since you've been gone
And I ain't gonna get no lovin' till you come home
Smiles of yesterday now find me cryin' the red and golden rainbow turned to blue
With every breath I take I feel like dyin'
A life just ain't worth livin' when I ain't got you
Each and every day I've been without you is one more hurtin' lonely day too long
Ain't had no lovin' since you've been gone
And I ain't gonna get no lovin' till you come home
Ain't had no lovin' since you've been gone
And I ain't gonna get no lovin' till you come home
