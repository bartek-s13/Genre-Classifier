I need you cause i love you
Always and forever
And i love you cause ive known you
Always and forever
Well time it flys
And time it runs by
And time will run out on us soon
Your eyes filled with tears
From fighting your fears
Searching for who you are
And i will be here
Waiting my dear
Always and forever
I need you cause i love you
Always and forever
Well i love you cause ive known you
Always and forever
The moon and stars
And the sun streaches far
Shining for all to veiw
Eternaly bound they light up the ground
Never once being untrue
And you are for me
A light which i need
Always and forever
I need you cause i love you
Always and forever
And i love you cause ive known you
Always and forever
Always and forever
