Just about a mile off'a one-oh-nine
There's a little church sittin' back in the pines
I promised that girl she was gonna be mine
I wouldn't be surprised if she was standin' there cryin'

Oh, I didn't know a bored out Ford could go so slow
Oh, you got to put your foot down on the floor
Yeah we've been rockin' all night, but don't you know
You gotta get me to the church on Cumberland Road

Billy's passed out in the back, but I think he's alive
Bobby's got his head hangin' over the side
Here we are doin' only ninety-five
What's the matter with you man
I thought you said you could drive

Oh, I didn't know a bored out Ford could go so slow
Oh, you got to put your foot down on the floor
Yeah we've been rockin' all night, but don't you know
You gotta get me to the church on Cumberland Road

Sweeter than the dew on a honeysuckle vine
Warmer than noon on the fourth of July
Cutest little girl that I ever have known
Waitin' at the church on Cumberland Road

Oh, I didn't know a bored out Ford could go so slow
Oh, you got to put your foot down on the floor
'Cause we've been rockin' all night, but don't you know
You gotta get me to the church on Cumberland Road

Yeah we've been rockin' all night but don't you know
You gotta get me to the church on Cumberland Road
