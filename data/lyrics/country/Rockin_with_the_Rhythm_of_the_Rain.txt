Sitting on the porch swing
Listen to the light rain
Beating on the tin roof
Baby
Just me and you
Rockin' with the rhythm of the rain
Slide on over
Baby, hold me closer
Moving to and fro
Just swaying
Like a slow freight train
Rockin' with the rhythm of the rain

So let the breeze keep blowing
Rocking with the rhythm of the rain
That's a fallin'
Night birds a singing
The cricket a calling
Oh, my heart will never be the same
Keep the sweet feeling flowing
Whisper in my ear, baby
Oh, feels so fine
Nights like this
Come once in a lifetime
Me and my baby
Rockin' with the rhythm of the rain

Oh, baby
Hold me tight say
Say you love me
That's all I wanna hear tonight
Sitting on the porch swing
Listening to the light rain
Beating on the tin roof
Baby
Just me and you
Rockin' with the rhythm of the rain
Slide on over
Baby, hold me closer
Moving to and fro
Just swaying
Like a slow freight train
Rockin' with the rhythm of the rain

Me and my baby
Rockin' with the rhythm of the rain
