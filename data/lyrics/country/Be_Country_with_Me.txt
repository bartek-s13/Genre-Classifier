Baby let's take a ride
Down to the countryside
Where crickets sing a lullaby
We'll make it our song
And leave behind the city lights
Just me, you, and the fireflies
Barefoot on the riverside
Dance all night long

I'd like to show to you where I come from
Give me just one night, you'll fall in love
With the starry nights, the air you breathe
That's who I am, baby you'll see
If you come and be country with me

I know a spot up on a hill
The perfect place where we can build
Ourselves a home
Watch the red sunset paint the west
Lay my head down on your chest
Make love 'til dawn, out here alone

I'd like to show to you where I come from
Give me just one night, you'll fall in love
With the starry nights, the air you breathe
That's who I am, baby you'll see
If you come and be country with me
I'd like to show to you where I come from
Give me just one night, you'll fall in love
I'd like to show to you where I come from
Give me just one night, you'll fall in love
With the starry nights, the air you breathe
That's who I am, baby you'll see
If you come and be country with me
Be country with me
