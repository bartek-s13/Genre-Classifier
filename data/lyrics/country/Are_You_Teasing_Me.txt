When we're all alone dear and I'm in your arms
Are you teasing me when your telling me
How you thrill to my charm
Are you teasing me
Are you untrue when I'm not with you
When we're apart are you free
Tell me darling while our love is still young
Are you teasing me
You say that my kissing set your heart in a whirl
Are you teasing me
And that you'll be mine till the end of the world
Are you teasing me
You tell me my love makes your life complete
And tied in my arms you want to be
Tell me darling while our love is still young
Are you teasing me
