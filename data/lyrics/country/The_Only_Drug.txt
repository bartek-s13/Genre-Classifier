I been rolling up and down that lost highway
Doing everything I wanted to every which way I could
As long as it felt good
But there's nothing that can make me feel the way you can
So I gave up my addictions
I'm a brand new man, it's true
Cause all I really want is you!
Baby you got what I need, nothing else'll do
Nothing gets me high on life or drunk on love the way you do
So if your thinking I'm addicted
I guess it's kinda true, but they can keep their drink
Their smoke, their pills, and their cocaine too
Because your loves the only drug I do!
