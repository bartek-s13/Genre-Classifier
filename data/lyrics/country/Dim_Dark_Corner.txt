Love can't live in a dim dark corner
Love needs sunshine, the rain and the air
Yes, here we are in a dim dark corner
Tasting forbidden fruit and too much in love to care
What's to become of us? I guess in my heart I know
One of those times your conscience will keep you home
Here I'll be in this dim dark corner
Hopelessly loving you, waiting and crying alone
What's to become of us? I guess in my heart I know
One of those times your conscience will keep you home
Here I'll be in this dim dark corner
Hopelessly loving you, waiting and crying alone
