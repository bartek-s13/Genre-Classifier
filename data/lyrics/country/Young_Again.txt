I can hear the music from the bars out in the street
I got a neon rhythm in my hands and in my feet
Dancin' here with you and the way you look at me
You set fire to the moon, there's nowhere else I'd rather be

And every song we're singin', we're singin' about us
This night could last forever, but it won't be long enough

'Cause we're drunk on love and whiskey shots
So what the clock says 1 a.m
And we'll raise a glass to the wild and free
We will never be this young again
(Wooaahhhoo woooaaahh)
We will never be this young again

Throw a twenty in the jukebox, playin' DJ for the night
Got some friends in low places helpin' us get high
Yeah, the morning's comin' quick, but we got time to steal a kiss
It's like the best nights of our lives are gonna all go down like this

'Cause we're drunk on love and whiskey shots
So what the clock says 2 a.m
And we'll raise a glass to the wild and free
We will never be this young again
(Wooaahhhoo woooaaahh)
We will never be this young again
Every song we're singing's out of tune and out of time
We're just gettin' started when they're callin' closin' time

'Cause we're drunk on love and whiskey shots
So what the clock says 3 a.m
And we'll raise a glass to the wild and free
We will never be this young again
Yeah, we're drunk on love and whiskey shots
So what the clock says 4 a.m
And the sun will rise long before we sleep
We will never be this young again
(Wooaahhhoo woooaaahh)
We will never be this young again
(Wooaahhhoo woooaaahh)
We will never be this young again
