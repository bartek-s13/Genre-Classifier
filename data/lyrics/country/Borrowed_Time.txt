When it comes to you and me
It's never how it's supposed to be
And every time you come around
It gets a little harder to breath
If we only have tonight
I wouldn't change a thing
No I wouldn't change a thing
And I ain't going anywhere
It's too late for me to leave
It's too late for me to leave

Cause I'm falling in slow motion
We only have this moment
Even if God gave us, forever
It still wouldn't be enough of your love
So as long as you're selling
Then you know I'd buy it
A little bit more of this borrowed time

Let's not waste what we have left
Just talking about goodbye no
We can sit here pretending
We have more than a lifetime, than a lifetime
How can something end so soon
When it feels so right
Yeah it feels so right

I'm falling in slow motion
We only have this moment
Even if God gave us forever
It still wouldn't be enough of your love
So as long as you're selling
Then you know I'd buy it
A little bit more of this borrowed time
Borrowed time

This life is ours to live
This time is all we get so

I'm only falling in slow motion
We only have this moment
Even if God gave us forever
It still wouldn't be enough of your love
So as long as you're selling
Then you know I'd buy it
A little bit more of this borrowed time
