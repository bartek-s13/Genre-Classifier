My baby she talks softly
My baby she found out
You catch more flies with honey
More with a whisper than a shout
My baby she don't scold me
No she don't like to fight
She knows a little secret
How to keep me home at night
She likes it sweet and easy
She likes the simple things
Sunsets and dewey mornings
And the way my guitar rings
We like to sing together
Harmonies all night long
She don't need flash or fancy
She loves the one chord song
One chord song
All night long
It never does me wrong
One chord song
All night long
It never does me wrong
We like to sing together
Harmonies all night long
She don't need flash or fancy
She loves the one chord song
My baby she don't scold me
No she don't like to fight
She knows that little secret
How to keep me home at night
One chord song
All night long
It never does me wrong
One chord song
All night long
It never doe
