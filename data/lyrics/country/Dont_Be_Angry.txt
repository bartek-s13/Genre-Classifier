Don't be angry at me darling if I fail to understand
All your little whims and wishes all the time
Just remember that I'm dumb I guess like any foolish man
And my head stays sorta foggy cause you're mine
Well I recall the first time that I flirted with you dear
When I jokingly said come and be my bride
Now that time has turned the pages it's the sweetest joke on earth
That I have you here, forever by my side
Maybe someday you're gonna hurt me I've been hurt in love before
Only God can know and time alone will tell
But in the mean time I'll keep loving you with all my heart and soul
And pray God to let it last if it's his will
So don't be angry...
