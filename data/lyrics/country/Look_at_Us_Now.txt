Just a couple kids with a big dream
That's what you do when you're in love and you're 16
House on a hill with an oak tree
Have a couple kids, push 'em on a tire swing

Ooh, we had it all planned out
Ooh, and everyone had their doubts

But look at us now, look at us now
There's a ring on the finger that I'm wrapped around
Look at us now, look at us now
We got a baby with my eyes and he's got your smile
Livin' that good life with you, baby
Everybody thought that we were crazy
But look at us now, look at us now
Baby, look at us now

I'm still all about you, you're still all about me
And after all these years, baby all I see
Is the same girl I feel in love with
I went from boyfriend, to fiancé, to husband
Yeah, ooh, we had it all planned out
Ooh, and everyone had their doubts

But look at us now, look at us now
There's a ring on the finger that I'm wrapped around
Look at us now, look at us now
Got a baby with my eyes and he's got your smile
Livin' that good life with you, baby
Everybody thought that we were crazy
But look at us now, look at us now
Baby, look at us now, yeah

Ooh, we had it all planned out
Ooh, everyone had their doubts
But look at us now, look at us now (Hey)

Look at us now, look at us now
There's a ring on the finger that I'm wrapped around
Look at us now, look at us now
We got a baby with my eyes and he's got your smile
Livin' that good life with you, baby
Everybody thought that we were crazy
But look at us now, look at us now
Baby, look at us now
