At times she still comes around
Though she's someone else's now
I can't lay it down no matter how I try
To forget her when  I find
She's no farther than my mind
Makes me wonder if I ever said goodbye

Night and day, it's all the same
So pour some whiskey on the flame
Burn another memory in my mind
Through the years she's moved up town
While I've come a long way down
Makes me wonder if I ever said goodbye

Yes, she always says hello the way she used to
But my God, she only said goodbye one time
Heaven knows I live in hell, this barroom is my cell
Makes me wonder if I ever said goodbye
Makes me wonder if I ever said goodbye
