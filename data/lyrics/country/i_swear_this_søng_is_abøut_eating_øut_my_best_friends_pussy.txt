Give me one night
To hold you
I'll do my best
Not to haunt you
I know I do this all the time

I'm falling so slow
Within you
Watch me unfold
Before you
And now I'm gone
I'm gone
I'm gone

Babe I know that we were blind
I wish I never made you mine
I know I do this all the time

Try to fill my heart when I'm fuckin with a bitch but
I can't find a way to escape the emptiness yuh
Baby, my love, tell me is it enough
Gripping my wrist with your hand like a cuff
Holding me down, holding me down
Pulling me down
Baby yea I'll go down
Kissing on your locale
Holding on your thighs baby
Draw me in your soft sounds
Heavy are my eyes now
Falling with your sighs girl
My head between your thighs
I'll fuck you with my lungs now
Tryna find a hole
Wrap me up gold baby
Can you find my soul?
My chest is going numb baby
Will you be my hoe?
Because I'm lonely
I'm feeling so alone babe
I'm feeling so alone yea

Baby yea I'm still in love with you
Baby yea I'm still in love with you
Baby yea I'm still in love with you
Still in love, still in love
