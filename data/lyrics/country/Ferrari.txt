I’m like a cigarette
Burning down on Marlboro
Waiting on the curb for you
Hurry up, don’t mess around
Let’s get gone, I’m going now
Gonna do what I wanna do
Got my nails did, hair done
Headlights pulling up
Ooh baby, here I come

I don’t care that it costs two grand
Cause I like how it handles in my hands
Stereo up, with the top let back
And if you see me
I’m probably running way too fast, yeah
I don’t care that there’s holes in the floor
And all them down straps don’t work anymore
Even though it ugly, I ain’t sorry
I’mma still drive it like, like it’s a Ferrari
No, I ain’t sorry
I ain’t sorry
I’mma still drive it like, like it’s a Ferrari

I come up every lane
Engine red, round the bend
Acting like I’m queen of the night
Everybody round me shining
And that person in their diamonds
I’m just working hard for a dime
Cause it’s got real steel, strong feel
Knowing that it’s mine
Gets me off every time


Ferrari
Yeah, yeah
Oh nah, nah
I ain’t sorry, oh yeah
And it may not look like a million bucks
But under that hood
I keep it souped up good


I ain’t sorry
I’mma still drive it like, like it’s a Ferrari
