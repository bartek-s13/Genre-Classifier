Why must you disappear
Why must you go when I need you here with me
Don't you know how much I love you?
And why must you say goodbye
Once you saved my life
Now you're leaving me here to die
Girl, don't you know how much I love you?
You give me just enough to keep me hoping
Enough to make me forget the promises you've broken
Oh, why must you come around just to pick me up
So you can watch me hit the ground
Don't you know how much I love you?
Don't you know
Oh
Don't you know
Oh
Don't you know
Oh
Don't you know
Don't you know
Don't you know how much I love you?
You give me just enough to keep me hoping
Enough to make me forget the promises you've broken
Oh, tell me how long must this go on?
I'm so far gone
I'm on my knees now, baby
Don't you know how much I love you?
Don't you know how much I love you?
Don't you know how much I love you?
Don't you know
Oh
Don't you know
Oh
Don't you know
Oh
Don't you know
Don't you know
Don't you know how much I love you?
