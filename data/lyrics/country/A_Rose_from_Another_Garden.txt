Our love was as strong
As a flower in the spring
So full of life and colors
We kept it alive
With tenderness and desire
Trust was our sunshine and water
But lately I find myself praying for rain
For the light of the sun
To bring her home again
Is she tending to a rose
From another garden?
While ours slowly grows dry
Is she tending to a rose
From another garden?
Letting our love die on the vine
Should I lay the blame
Or feel any shame?
Should I be the one to let go?
Did her love like a rose
Changed with the season
Truly beyond her control
Should I hold on to the thorns
Or get on with my life?
Are the roots deep enough
For our love to survive?
Is she tending to a rose
From another garden?
While ours slowly grows dry
Is she tending to a rose
From another garden?
Letting our love die on the vine
Letting our love die on the vine
