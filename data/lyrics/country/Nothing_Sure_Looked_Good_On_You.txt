You found your greener pastures in a mansion on the hill
With a flashy foreign car to drive and lots of time to kill
Now my mind keeps on remembering the days of me and you
But when we were down to nothing, nothin' sure looked good on you
You said you needed simple things that I had plenty of
And through the days of dark and rain we could always live on love
With his style in life he lured you and you could not refuse
But when we were down to nothin', nothin' sure looked so good on you
When you honeymooned in Paris it was carried on the news
And I heard you laughed your cares away on a Caribbean cruise
You were always one for dreamin', now your dreams can all come true
But when we were down to nothin', nothin' sure looked good on you
You said you needed simple things that I had plenty of
And through the days of dark and rain we could always live on love
With his style in life he lured you and you could not refuse
But when we were down to nothin', nothin' sure looked so good on you
