I swear it’s never felt like this
She ain’t like any girl I’ve met
She walks in and I lose my breath
Prettiest girl in the room
Hands down
Someone told me when you know you
I want her with me everywhere I go
Every love songs on the radio
It’s like I finally know what they’re singin about

Yea this girl she’s got me shinin’
Struck me like a sip of white lighting
Can’t find the words to describe it
Hang on a second I'll try
Feels like

Rollin 100 miles an hour top down on a two lane
Like
Climbin’ up a water tower watchin’ that sunset fade, it’s like
Jumpin out an airplane
Way up over everything
Never gonna hit the ground
It’s like your
All time high
Best buzz you’ve ever had
It Feels Like That
Feels Like That
When shes lovin' me back
Yea it feels like, yea it feels like
Feels Like That
Call it crazy you can call it luck
All I know is I can’t get enough
If you could find a way bottle it up
Ohh You’d be a Billionaire I swear

Yea this girl shes got me thinkin’
Bout one knee diamond ringin’
Bout a money down white picket fence thing
But All I know right now
Is it feels like

Rollin 100 miles an hour top down on a two lane
Like
Climbin’ up a water tower watchin’ that sunset fade, it’s like
Jumpin out an airplane
Way up over everything
Never gonna hit the ground
It’s like your
All time high
Best buzz you’ve ever had
It Feels Like That
Feels Like That
When shes lovin' me back
Yea it feels like, yea it feels like
Feels Like That
Yea this girl she’s got me shinin’
Struck me like a sip of white lighting
Can’t find the words to describe it
Feels Like

Rollin 100 miles an hour top down on a two lane
Like
Climbin’ up a water tower watchin’ that sunset fade, it’s like
Jumpin' out an airplane
Way up over everything
Never gonna hit the ground
It’s like your
All time high
Best buzz you’ve ever had
It Feels Like That
Feels Like That
When shes lovin' me back
Yea it feels like, yea it feels like
Feels Like That
