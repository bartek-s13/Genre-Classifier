God bless Texas and Deacon Shackleford
He read the bible seven times and he believed every word
That ol' beat up leather book had been through it all
He sat on the back pew so he could chew him a chaw singing
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound, that saved a wretch like me
He carried candy for the kids in his Sunday dress coat
He'd take me fishing after church, he taught me things I needed to know
No Deacon didn't have a family, Lord knows he wished he did
He told the whole congregation that I was his grandkid
And today he joined up with Jesus wearin' shiny pearl snaps
We sang a few gospel hymns and then the soldier played Taps
I bet he's walkin' with Pete down a street paved with gold
Showin' off his brand spankin' new wings and his barbed wire halo
He married sweet Emma Grace before the war was through
She held his right arm next to his anchor tattoo
He was on a ship off at sea, when she died in child birth
He lost his whole world from the far side of the Earth
He lost the will to love, he lost the will to live
Until he met a man who taught him to forgive
Yeah life took him to hell and back, to hell and back a time or two
But in the end he beat the devil until he was black and blue
Singin' I once was lost, but now I'm found, was blind but now I see…
And today he joined up with Jesus wearin' shiny pearl snaps
We sang a few gospel hymns and then the soldier played Taps
I bet he's walkin' with Pete down a street paved with gold
Showin' off his brand spankin' new wings and his barbed wire halo
Before he went, he made me promise him that I wouldn't cry
And though I told him that I wouldn't, you know I couldn't help but lie
'Cause today he joined up with Jesus wearin' shiny pearl snaps
We sang a few gospel hymns and then the soldier played Taps
I bet he's walking with Pete down a street paved with gold
As sure as the old church bell still rings
He always said he had country in his soul
He's showin' off his brand spankin' new wings and his barbed wire halo
Sweet chariot comin' forth to carry me home
Swing low sweet chariot comin' forth to carry me home
