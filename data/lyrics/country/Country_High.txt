It's that morning sun coming up peaking through the sycamore trees
Coffee strong, bacon on, taking off down to the creek
Dropping tailgate, fresh bait, all day and I ain't catching a thin
But a feel good feeling that only all that can bring

Give me that country high, that big old blue sky
No there ain't nothing like kicking back in the sunshine
You and me somewhere int he middle of nowhere
Buzzing on every honey suckle breath of fresh air we can find
Give me that, give me that country high

Let's put our getting on, shoes on
What you say we get on out of town?
I need a wide open gravel slinging dusty old road to go down
Out where the corn grows, don't you know, our road like a lazy old hound


Let's go rolling down a river, no one else around You and me together, all strung out
