It takes a long time to forget, what caused a lifetime of regret
And the day slips slowly by, we can run but we can't hide
And you ask me to forgive, you said lets just go on and live
Like it's my choice to make, oh honey I bend but I don't break
Things were different when we were young
And our story had just began
Who knew that growin' old could ever be so cold?
Together but alone
Together but alone
But now we sleep in different rooms
A love that blossomed but never bloomed
What were we runnin' from?
Something we were scared to become
Things were different when we were young
And our story had just began
Who knew that growin' old could ever be so cold?
Together but alone
Together but alone
Things were different when we were young
And our story had just began
Who knew that growin' old could ever be so cold?
Together but alone
Together but alone
Together but alone
Together but alone
