Well it's late tonight
And I see the look in your eyes
They lighten you up like a burning fire full of desire
And I touch your face
And you move with grace
And our lips collide in a burning ride with a warm embrace
Cause I wanna taste your skin
And I wanna be let in
I wanna hold you, and feel you
Like you've never been
And I wanna touch you there
I wanna kiss you here
And maybe, by the sunrise, we'll both come to our senses
Well I close my eyes
But I open my heart
As the heat of the moment slowly tears our clothes apart
And we begin to move
And I slowly surrender to the beauty and seduction
That embodies you
Cause I wanna taste your skin
And I wanna be let in
I wanna hold you, and feel you
Like you've never been
And I wanna touch you there
I wanna kiss you here
And maybe, by the sunrise, we'll both come to our senses
Cause I wanna taste your skin
And I wanna be let in
I wanna hold you, and feel you
Like you've never been
And I wanna touch you there
I wanna kiss you here
And maybe, by the sunrise, we'll both come oh to our senses
Oh baby
I said maybe, by the sunrise, we'll both come to our senses
