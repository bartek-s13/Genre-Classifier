Come and listen in to a radio station
Where the mighty hosts of heaven sing
Turn your radio on, turn your radio on
Turn your radio on, turn your radio on
If you wanna hear the songs of Zion
Coming from the land of in the spring
Get in touch with God, turn your radio on
Turn your radio on
Turn your radio on and listen to the music in the air
Turn your radio on
Turn your radio on and glory share
Turn the lights down low
Turn the lights down low and listen to the masters radio
Get in touch with God
Get in touch with God, turn your radio on
Turn your radio on
Listen to the songs of the fathers and mothers
And the many friends gone on before
Turn your radio on, turn your radio on
Turn your radio on, turn your radio on
Some eternal morning we shall meet them
Over on the alleluia shore
Get in touch with God, turn your radio on
Turn your radio on
Turn your radio on and listen to the music in the air
Turn your radio on
Turn your radio on and glory share
Turn the lights down low
Turn the lights down low and listen to the masters radio
Get in touch with God
Get in touch with God, turn your radio on
Turn your radio on
Turn your radio on
Turn your radio on and listen to the music in the air
Turn your radio on
Turn your radio on and glory share
Turn the lights down low
Turn the lights down low and listen to the masters radio
Get in touch with God
Get in touch with God, turn your radio on
Turn your radio on
