She threw her brush across the room and hung up her dress
Said I don't feel pretty, my hairs all a mess
Tucked her curls underneath a ball cap
I just shook my head and said with a laugh
Honey I didn't fall in love with your hair
Up or down girl I really don't care
The heart that's inside you is why I stopped and stared
I swear I didn't fall in love with your hair
Sometimes I wish you could see what I see
When you think you're at your worst girl you're perfect to me
In faded jeans over just my teeshirt
You're still the most beautiful girl in the world
I didn't fall in love with your hair
Brown or blond girl I really don't care
The heart that's inside you is why I stopped and stared
I swear I didn't fall in love with your hair
Phone call came in from her doctor back home
The cancer had spread and she threw down the phone
She looked in the mirror, tears running down her cheeks
Said if it all falls out, baby what would you think?
I didn't fall in love with your hair
Hair or gone girl I really don't care
The heart that's inside you is why I stopped and stared
I swear I didn't fall in love with your hair
I didn't fall in love with your hair
Hair or gone girl I really don't care
The heart that's inside you is why I stopped and stared
I swear I didn't fall in love with your hair
