Oh, it's on now
C'mon

Somebody better call the law
We done took it outside we池e about to brawl
Old boy done put his hands on a woman
Where I come from son, the next thing coming is a
Ass whooping in the parking lot
About to drop this fool right in front of the cops
And I ain稚 going to run
I'm proud of what I done

Yeah read me my rights, put me in cuffs
Take me downtown, barney lock me up
And I値l do my time and raise my right hand
I値l tell the judge that I'd do it again

Well I heard it through the grapevine
Good daddy and a husband is a-doing time
Said his wife and his kids was in the house
Some old boy broke in, man it all went south
When he dropped the hammer on his forty five
Now he's in the pen; twenty-five to life
I hate to say, but if it'd have been me
Well, I'd have said

Read me my rights, put me in cuffs
Yeah, take me downtown barney lock me up
I値l do my time and raise my right hand
I値l tell the judge that I'd do it again

If I have to put the law in my hands, yeah
Well it has time to break
Because I know right from wrong and if you cross that line
Boy all I gotta say is
All I've gotta say, boy

Is read me my rights put me in cuffs
Take me downtown barney lock me up
I値l do my time and raise my right hand
I値l tell the judge I壇 do it again

Read me my rights, put me in cuffs
Take me downtown, you better lock me up
I値l do my time and raise my right hand
I値l tell the judge that I'd do that shit again
