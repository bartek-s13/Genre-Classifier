Train rolls in at 10:00 AM
Kill the lamb for the lions, find some water for the elephants
The monkey on my shoulder got a monkey on his back
Could I bum a cigarette, he done smoked my last pack
Throw up the big tent, throw down the sawdust
We don't open 'til tomorrow, so step right up
We got beer for the bearded lady
And the Siamese twins are into opium
The trapeze guys are all high on cocaine
That they bought from a guy that used to drive the train
We got water for the elephants
Everybody knows the greatest party on earth
Is the circus down on Ringling Road
Well, the tattoo man is makin' out with snake lady
Just to piss off the human cannonball that she been datin'
The clown got wasted and he's throwing his shoes
At a bear on a bike with a bottle of booze
The tightrope walker is to damn high
Welcome to a freakshow Friday night
We got beer for the bearded lady
And the Siamese twins are into opium
The trapeze guys are all high on cocaine
That they bought from a guy that used to drive the train
We got water for the elephants
Everybody knows the greatest party on earth
Is the circus down on Ringling Road
Ringling Road
Down on Ringling Road
We got beer for the bearded lady
And the Siamese twins are into opium
The trapeze guys are all high on cocaine
That they bought from a guy that used to drive the train
We got beer for the bearded lady
And the Siamese twins are into opium
The trapeze guys are all high on cocaine
That they bought from a guy that used to drive the train
We got water for the elephants
Everybody knows the greatest party on earth
Is the circus down on Ringling Road
