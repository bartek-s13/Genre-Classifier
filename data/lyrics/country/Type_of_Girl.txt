Hmm, oh, oh

I'm not the girl who keeps her mouth shut
I ain't no highbrow but it ain't no secret
Give me that dive, old school ride
If you say no then I'm still gonna try
I'm not the kind to ever really give up

Laying on the line and it's no surprise
What you're getting into
I'll be kind and then I lose my mind
Over something you didn't do

Yeah, I'm crazy
And I know that you kinda like it
Listen baby
If you come into my world
There'll be magic
Mixed with a little madness
I'm dramatic, yeah
I'm the type of girl
I'll give you that low
Sugar rush high
If you're cool with that, you can be my guy
I like to make up, after a fight
'Cause I'm that type of girl

If you're the guy
Who's looking for a good wife
Don't look at me
To fit that '50s-stereotype
I cook, sometimes clean
Gotta pull your weight
If you sleep with me
But I'm telling you
Yeah baby
We'll have one hell of a good time

Make no mistake
You know I won't be fake
That's something I'll never do
I'll compromise and then I'll change my mind
You'll think what you got yourself into

'Cause I'm crazy
And I know that you kinda like it
Listen baby
If you come into my world
There'll be magic
Mixed with a little madness
I'm dramatic, yeah
I'm the type of girl
I'll give you that low
Sugar rush high
If you're cool with that, you can be my guy
I like to make up, after a fight
'Cause I'm that type of girl

Vincent painted a masterpiece
Newton discovered gravity
You got the impossible job
Of just loving me
'Cause I'm a nightmare
Wrapped up in candy
I look so sweet, but too much of me
You'll get sick, babe
This ain't a trick, say
Love can be poison or a remedy

Yeah, I'm crazy
And I know that you kinda like it
Listen, baby
If you come into my world
There'll be magic
Mixed with a little madness
It's dramatic, yeah
I'm the type of girl
I'll give you that low
Sugar rush high
If you're cool with that, you can be my guy
I like to make up, after a fight
'Cause I'm that type of girl

That type of girl, hmm
I'm the type of girl
