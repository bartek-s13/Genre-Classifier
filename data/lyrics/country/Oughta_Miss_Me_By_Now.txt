I see her light in the window again
I drive by but I can't go in
She's got her space, I've got my pride
I can see her silhouette
She's at that mirror by her bed
She won't sleep a wink tonight

She oughta miss me by now
She oughta pick up that phone
For crying out loud
This has gone on too long
She should have come to her senses
And want to work it all out
As bad as I'm hurting
She oughta miss me by now

I haven't wrote, I haven't called
Ain't sent one single rose at all
I haven't shown up at her door
Don't go to places that she goes
I've moved on for all she knows
That should make her want me more

She oughta miss me by now
She oughta pick up that phone
For crying out loud
This has gone on too long
She should have come to her senses
And want to work it all out
As bad as I'm hurting
She oughta miss me by now

She should have come to her senses
And want to work it all out
As bad as I'm hurting
She oughta miss me by now
As bad as I'm hurting
She oughta miss me by now
