Monday mornin' I get up
With Friday on my mind
And I hit the ground runnin'
From sun up to quittin' time
When that weekend whistle blows
I race across town to pick you up
I just can't get there fast enough
{chorus}
We'll take it slow
Creepin' down a back road
Slow
Watchin' the sun go down with my arm around you
Love song comin' on strong through the stereo
Slow
Sippin' on a bottle of red
Slow
Dancin' in the truck bed
With nothin' between us but the cool night air
Lettin' it all go
Slow
It's a right now world we're livin' in
And all I want right now is you
We can hop a plane to Vegas
Roll the dice and say, "I do"
Get a two bed, one bath shotgun shack
Baby, on the way; a dog out back
Or we can just stay right where we're at
Takin' it slow
Creepin' down a back road
Slow
Watchin' the sun go down with my arm around you
Love song comin' on strong through the stereo
Slow
Sippin' on a bottle of red
Slow
Dancin' in the truck bed
With nothin' between us but the cool night air
Lettin' it all go
Slow
Oh, I sure love what we got cookin'
I ain't tryin' to rush this thing
But girl tonight the way you're lookin'
I can't wait
To take it slow
Creepin' down a back road
Slow
Watchin' the sun go down with my arm around you
Love song comin' on strong through the stereo
Slow
Sippin' on a bottle of red
Slow
Dancin' in the truck bed
With nothin' between us but the cool night air
Lettin' it all go
Slow
Lettin' it all go
