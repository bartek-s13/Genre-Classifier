Immerse my underlying message
One for all of her and one for him
Open up let's play our part in this
Terms are yours to use them as you wish
Don't you love it when the rain
Falls down upon your face
Like sleeping on a train
When there's nothing else at stake
I'm leaving when the sun burns and tears my soul apart
But I'll never leave you stranded with your broken down heart
Cos I love it when it rains
Immerse our underlying message
One for all of you and one for me
Open up let's play our part in this
Terms are ours to use them as we wish
Don't you love it when the rain
Falls down upon your face
Like sleeping on a train
When there's nothing else at stake
I'm leaving when the sun burns and tears my soul apart
And I'll never leave you stranded, no I'll never leave you stranded
Ukelele Solo
Don't you love it when the rain
Falls down upon your face
Like sleeping on a train
When there's nothing else at stake
I'm leaving when the sun burns and tears my soul apart
And I'll never leave you stranded, with your broken down heart
Don't you love it when the rain
Falls down upon your face
Like sleeping on a train train train train
When there's nothing else at stake
I'm leaving when the sun burns and tears my soul apart
And I'll never leave you stranded, no I'll never leave you stranded
I'll never leave you stranded, with your broken down heart
Because I love it when it rains
Oh you know I love it when it rains
You know I love it when it rains
