Smokey Mountain memories
About my home in Tennessee
Yesterday keeps calling me
Calling me home
Mountains rising in my soul
Higher than the dreams I've known
Misty eyed, they cling to me, my Smokey Mountain memories
An old gray man with a dog asleep at his feet
Played a worn out fiddle full of melodies
He smiled with his eyes but the lines on his face
Told me as much as the tunes he played
Talking about my...
Smokey Mountain memories
Pretty girl from Tennessee
I was such a fool to leave
Leave her all alone
Think about her in my dreams
Wonder if she thinks of me
I'll always hold her close to me in my Smokey Mountain memories
So mister play your fiddle please, play some mountain melodies
I been down a lonely road to far away from home
Nothing left to hold on to, made some plans but they fell through
Now there's nothing left for me but my Smokey Mountain memories
Smokey Mountain memories
About my home in Tennessee
Yesterday keeps calling me
Calling me home
Mountains rising in my soul
Higher than the dreams I've known
Misty eyed, they cling to me, my Smokey Mountain memories
