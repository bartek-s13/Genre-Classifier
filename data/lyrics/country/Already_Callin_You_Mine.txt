I barely know you, you barely know me
We ain't but two slow dances into this thing
Come on and sit down, I'll order us a round
I want to know everything

Girl where's your hometown
Are those your momma's eyes
What are you doing
For the rest of your life

'Cause I'm already thinking about you and me
Getting out of here and taking a drive
Just slide a little closer
Put your head on my shoulder
Like this ain't our first time
Girl don't worry 'bout holding on tight
'Cause I'm already callin'
I'm already callin' you mine
Whoa whoa

I know that there's a chance
I'm thinking too fast
Tell me, tell me am I right
Or am I reading this wrong
They'll play the last song
The lights will come on
That don't mean we can't take
The long way home, home, home

'Cause I'm already thinking about you and me
Getting out of here and taking a drive
Just slide a little closer
Put your head on my shoulder
Like this ain't our first time
Girl don't worry 'bout holding on tight
'Cause I'm already callin'
I'm already callin' you mine

If you like the way that sounds
We can leave this place right now, right now

'Cause I'm already thinking about you and me
Getting out of here and taking a drive
Just slide a little closer
Put your head on my shoulder
Like this ain't our first time
Girl don't worry 'bout holding on tight
'Cause I'm already callin'
I'm already callin' you mine
Whoa Whoa
I'm already callin' you mine
Whoa whoa
