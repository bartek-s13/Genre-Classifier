When I was young I was fearless and bright
I made big decisions and I had you in sight
But then you checked in
I won't let you check out
You say jump
I say how high?
Remember when we danced on the kitchen benchtop
Little long couth as my mother once goved
But I love your dancing shoes
And a smile on your face when there on
Paint your cup
Paint your cup
Blue just like my eyes
And I will cup it
Hold it
Drink it
Drink up for you
Paint my cup
Paint my cup Green
And I will cup it
Hold it
Drink it
Drink up for me
I had a feeling that I wanted you to know
I had a feeling that our lives would change
No looking back
No looking ahead
Only looking at right now instead
I've got a bone to pick with you
I've got a bone to pick with you
And I love you more than I loved you then
And I will always pin you too
Paint your cup
Paint your cup
Blue just like my eyes
And I will cup it
Hold it
Drink it
Drink up for you
Paint my cup
Paint my cup Green
And I will cup it
Hold it
Drink it
Drink up for me
Yeahhhhhhh
INSTRUMENTAL
And then we danced on the kitchen bench top
A little long couth as our children has goved
But I love your dancing shoes and the smile on your face when there on
Paint your cup
Paint your cup
Blue just like my eyes
And I will cup it
Hold it
Drink it
Drink up for you
Paint my cup
Paint my cup Green
And I will cup it
Hold it
Drink it
Drink up for me
Yeahhhhhhh
