Dim lights, thick smoke and loud, loud music
Is the only kind of life you'll ever understand
Dim lights, thick smoke and loud, loud music
You'll never make a wife to a home loving man
A home and little children mean nothing to you
A house filled with love and a husband so true
You'd rather have a drink with the first guy you meet
The only home you know is that bar down the street
Dim lights, thick smoke and loud, loud music
Is the only kind of life you'll ever understand
Dim lights, thick smoke and loud, loud music
You'll never make a wife to a home loving man
Drinking and dancing, to a honky tonk band
Is the only kind of life you'll ever understand
Go run and have your fun, you think you played it smart
I'm sorry for you and your honky tonk heart
