Some people like to rock, some people like to roll
Movin' and a groovin' gonna satisfy my soul
Let's have a party, wooh! let's have a party
Send him to the store, let's buy some more
Let's have a party tonight
I never kissed a bear, I never kissed a goon
But I can shake a chicken in the middle of the room
Let's have a party, wooh, let's have a party
Send him to the store, let's buy some more
Let's have a party tonight
Why not!
Wooh! Damn ...
I never kissed a bear, I never kissed a goon
But we can shake a chicken in the middle of the room
Let's have a party, wooh! let's have a party
Send him to the store, let's buy some more
Let's have a party tonight
Well, Honky Tonky Joe is knockin' at the door
Bring him in, fill him up, set him on the floor
Let's have a party, wooh! let's have a party
Send him to the store let's buy some more
Let's have a party tonight
Now the meat is on the stove and the bread's a-gettin' hot
Everybody run, take the possum pappa shot
Let's have a party, wooh! let's have a party
Send him to the store
Let's buy some more
Let's have a party tonight
Well, let's have a party tonight
We're gonna have a party tonight
