Baby where are you going now?
Do you ever really know?
Oh you hate to be tied down
But you hate to sleep alone

I bet you still think about me
Yeah I bet you still think about me

Like I think about you
Even when I don't want to
There’s just something about you baby
There’s nothing that I can do
I think about you, you were always wild and free
I know we couldn’t hold on forever, but baby
I bet you still think about me

Are you driving up the coast?
Are you wearing any shoes?
Did you  outrun all your ghosts?
Like you were always tryna do...

I bet you still think about me
Yeah I bet you still think about me

Like I think about you
Even when I don't want to
There’s just something about you baby
There’s nothing that I can do
I think about you, you were always wild and free
I know we couldn’t hold on forever, but baby
I bet you still think about me
Like I think about you
Even when I don't want to
There’s just something about you baby
There’s nothing that I can do
I think about you, you were always wild and free
I know we couldn’t hold on forever, but baby
I bet you still think about me

Yeah I bet you still think about me
Yeah I bet you still think about me
