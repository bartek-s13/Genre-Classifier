I know you see me just sitting here drinking
And thinking about calling her up
Just give me time to come to my sense
And commencing to just getting drunk
'Cause I just need a moment alone to think it over
I promise, babe, I’ll forget
How she done me wrong for so long
But, girl, don't come over yet

And just leave, leave me alone
Why can't you see that I can’t move on?
'Cause I see her face in yours
And I hear her voice any time you talk
Her lips on the glass of the drink you're drinking
And her hips in the way you walk
So leave me alone

I know our eyes have met from afar
In this bar before
Be there up in line to buy her a drink
Or out there on the dance floor
But I can't believe the night of all nights
She chose to come and talk to me
But I ain't heard a word you've been saying
I'm talking to a memory
That I wish would leave, leave me alone
Why can't you see that I can’t move on?
’Cause I see her face in yours
And I hear her voice any time you talk
Her lips on the glass of the drink you're drinking
And her hips in the way you walk
So leave me alone

Just leave, leave me alone
Why can’t you see that I can't move on?
'Cause I see her face in yours
And I hear her voice any time you talk

Why don't you leave, leave me alone?
Why can’t you see that I can't move on?
'Cause I see her face in yours
And I hear her voice any time you talk
Her lips on the glass of the drink you're drinking
And her hips in the way you walk
So leave me alone
