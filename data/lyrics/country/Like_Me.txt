Without your glasses you just plain can't see
Your favorite color for the most part is green
You're close to your grandma on your mother's side
You can count up on one hand the times you have lied
You won't eat a tomato on a double-dog dare
You don't think you're a beauty but you do like your hair
Your complex and tricky, yet someways you're not
You're up some, you're down some
You're cold and you're hot
And who's gonna end up holdin' your hand-
A beautiful woman or a tall, handsome man?
There's no doubt they'll love you, but it's yet to be seen:
Will anyone ever know you like me?
Will anyone ever know you like me?
You like plantin' flowers, that's heaven to you
Crack open a beer when you're planting through
You'll paint all your toenails if you have time
While listening to Willie, Dylan and Pride
And who's gonna end up holdin' your hand-
A beautiful woman or a tall, handsome man?
There's no doubt they'll love you, but it's yet to be seen:
Will anyone ever know you like me?
You'd rather make-out then make love all night
You like if your bath is too hot
Your closet is cluttered with dress pants and Levis that you wish you'd never bought
And who's gonna end up holdin' your hand-
A beautiful woman or a tall, handsome man?
There's no doubt they'll love you, but it's yet to be seen:
Will anyone ever know you like me?
Will anyone ever know you like me?
