It’s been a long time coming
As you shed a lonesome tear
Now your in a wonderama
I wonder what your doing here
The flame no longer flickers
You’re feeling just like a fool
You keep staring into your liquor
I’m wondering what to do
I don’t hardly know you
But I’d be willing to show you
I know a way to make you smile
Let me touch you for a while
I’m gonna ruin my black mascara
You’re drinking whiskey when it should be wine
You keep on looking in to that mirror
But to me your looking really fine
I don’t hardly know you
But I’d be willing to show you
I know a way to make you laugh at that cowgirl as she’s walking out your door
I know a way to make you smile
Just let me whisper things
You never heard before
Just let me touch you baby
Just let me touch you for a while
I don’t hardly know
But I’d be willing to show you
I know a way to make you smile
It’s been a long time
Just let me touch you for a while
