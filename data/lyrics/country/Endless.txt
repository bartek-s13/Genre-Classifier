Do you ever think about
How its crazy that we found
Each other in this round big old world
Or do you ever wonder if what we're feeling really is
The kind of love that they write stories about
Baby if you're asking me I'll tell you now
Ooh, like a midnight summer sky
The way the stars light up the night
You can see for miles and miles
Ooh, like the way a river flows on and on until it goes out to sea I hope you know
My love is endless
My love is endless
I may not tell you near enough
Just how much you are loved
But I'm telling you right now, so you know
I never knew a heart could be this full but
I never knew somebody quite like you and I'm still amazed at how I love you so
So if you're asking me how far my love can go
Ooh, like a midnight summer sky
The way the stars light up the night
You can see for miles and miles
Ooh, like the way a river flows on and on until it goes out to sea
I hope you know
My love is endless
Ooh, like the way a river flows on and on until it goes out to sea
I hope you know
My love is endless
My love is endless
My love is endless
