Now I've got schemes
And you've got schemes
Let's get together and dream some dreams
Let's go
Times a wastin'
I've got lips
And I've got lips
Let's get together and use those lips
Let's go
Times a wastin'
A cakes no good if you don't mix the batter and bake it
And loves just a bubble if you don't take the trouble to make it
So if you're free to go with me
I'll take you quicker than one, two, three
Let's go
Times a wastin'
Now I've got blues
And I've got blues
Let's get acquainted and lose those blues
Let's go
Time's a wastin'
Now I've got feet
And I've got feet
Let's start to walk with a lovers beat
Let's go
Times a wastin'
You've got me feelin' love like I never have felt it
You're full of sugar and I'm think I'm the burner to melt it
