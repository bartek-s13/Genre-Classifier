I'm not a fool anymore
I'm not as dumb as before
All that has changed since it rained
Right from the sky from my eyes
So wipe those tears don't cry
It's over now all your life
All that has changed since it rained
Right from the sky from my eyes
You let me hug you, let me kiss you
And I kept on thinking that our love would always be
But my eyes don't lie to me
Cheating, lying
It's all comes back somehow
I'm not a fool anymore
I'm not a clown as before
All that has changed since it rained
Right from the sky from my eyes
You let me hug you, let me kiss you…
I'm not ashamed anymore
I'm not a clown as before
All that has changed since it rained
Right from the sky from my eyes
