Do you know how much it took for me?
To tell you that I think you're fine as hell
And do you wanna grab a bite to eat?
I got this coupon to taco bell
You say you can't right now and when I ask you why
You finally let it out, you say I'm not your type

But I'm a freakin' delight
I'm a freakin' delight
I got more bite than a California Zoo
And if you  ask my momma she gonna tell you the truth
That I'm a freakin' delight
I'm a freakin' delight
I got more pop than a shook up mountain dew
If that's not what you like
There must be something wrong with you
Cuz I'm a freakin' delight
I'm a freakin' delight
I'm a freakin' delight

I see my family every holiday
That's when they love to wreck my self-esteem
Ask me why I never bring a date
I think the first verse covered everything
Say I need a real job
I tell them all, please
I get to sing my songs and everybody thinks

I'm a freakin' delight
I'm a freakin' delight
I got more bite than a California Zoo
And if you  ask my momma she gonna tell you the truth
That I'm a freakin' delight
I'm a freakin' delight
I got more pop than a shook up mountain dew
If that's not what you like
There must be something wrong with you
Cuz I'm a freakin' delight
I'm a freakin' delight

Got the high score on Pacman at the arcade
I can still get a sunburn sitting in the shade
I'm pretty much the best at acting out charades
If  anybody  asks me, I'm gonna say

I'm a freakin' delight
I'm a freakin' delight
I got more bite than a California Zoo
And if you  ask my momma she gonna tell you the truth
That I'm a freakin' delight
I'm a freakin' delight
I got more pop than a shook up mountain dew
If that's not what you like
There must be
Something wrong with you
Cuz I'm a freakin' delight
I'm a freakin' delight
I'm a freakin' delight
