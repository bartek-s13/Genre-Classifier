I wanna call you up
But if I call you up I'm gonna hear your voice
And if I hear your voice
I'm gonna wanna give in and if I give in
I'm gonna get in my car
And if I get in my car I'm gonna come on over
But if I come over baby it's all over
One thing always leads to another

I don't trust myself
No oh oh
I don't trust myself
No oh oh

I wanna pour this wine
But if I pour this wine it's gonna go to my head
And if it goes to my head
I'm gonna think about you
And if i think about you it's gonna break my heart
And if it breaks my heart I'm gonna want you to hold me
So damn this heart put the cork in the bottle
One thing always leads to another

I don't trust myself
No oh oh
I don't trust myself
No oh oh
I don't trust myself
One thing always leads to another
One thing always leads to another

So maybe I'll just close my eyes
Maybe if I close my eyes

I'm gonna wanna call you up
But if I call you up I'm gonna hear your voice
And if I hear your voice I'm gonna wanna give in

I don't trust myself
No oh oh
I don't trust myself
No oh oh
Everything that I do leads me right back to you

I don't trust myself
No oh oh
One thing always leads to another
One thing always leads to another

I don't trust myself
No oh oh
I don't trust myself
No oh oh
