Hello, darlin', happy birthday
I've decided not to give you a present this year
In fact I think it's about time
I took some things away

I'd like to take away the suspicion
That I know clouds your world at times
By giving you some faith to hold onto honey
Whenever your hand is not in mine

Happy birthday darlin'
I've no presents, no fancy cake
But I hope I'll make you happy
With everything I take

I'd like to take away some of your lonely moments
By spending more of mine with you
And I'd like to take away some of those so-so kisses
And replace them with ones that really say "I love you"

And I wanna take away the doubt you sometimes have about my love
By showing more...much more that I've shown lately
And then if someone should ask you what I've got you for your birthday
Well you can say, "Why he didn't give me anything but he sure took a lotta things away"
Happy birthday darlin'
I've no presents, no fancy cake
But I hope I'll make you happy
With everything I take
Happy birthday darlin'
I've no presents, no fancy cake
But I hope I'll make you happy
With everything I take

Happy birthday darlin'
