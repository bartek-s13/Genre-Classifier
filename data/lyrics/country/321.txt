I never wanted anyone or anything the way I want you
Girl, I think I’m over my head
Something bout you messes with my mind and girl I just go crazy
Til I get to see you again
Then it’s 3-2-1, I’m countin down the hours
Til we’re driving around town, drive by the water tower
And it’s not 10-11, get a little time in heaven
Til we say goodnight and I’m a mess
Until I see you again
Until I see you again
All my friends, they tried to warn me, tell me I should take it slowly
‘Cause they know the trouble I’m in
But loving you is like a drug and girl I just can’t get enough
Until I get to see you again
Then it’s 3-2-1, I’m countin down the hours
Til we’re driving around town, drive by the water tower
And it’s 1-2-3, I know you gotta get til 3
So we say goodnight and I’m a mess
Until I see you again
Until I see you again

It’s 3-2-1, I’m countin down the hours
Til we’re driving around town, drive by the water tower
It’s 3-2-1, I’m countin down the time
Until we leave this town and I can make you mine
I know it’s 1-2-3, I know you gotta get til 3
So we say goodnight and I’m a mess
Then we say goodnight and I’m a mess
Until I see you again
Until I see you again
Gotta see you
Gotta see you
I never wanted anyone or anything the way I want you
Girl, I think I’m over my head
