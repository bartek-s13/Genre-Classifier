Wishing I could see you again dear
That the fire of love would burn once more
But I guess that's wishful thinking
And too much to be wishing for
Just thinking how you once kissed me
Wishing that it hadn't meant goodbye
But I guess that's wishful thinking
Now I know why some people cry
I'll just live my life in dreams and I long for your love
It's you I'm wishing for and it's you I'm thinking of
My heart echoes the love words you spoken
How I wish I could hear them from you
Won't you answer a heart that is broken
And to make my wishful thinking come true
My heart echoes the love words...
