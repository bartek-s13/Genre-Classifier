If you're gonna love somebody
Yeah you better love somebody
Who ruins your lipstick, not your mascara

You got a brand new, beat up broken heart
Black tears rollin' down your face
It's all crashin' down, you can't love again
'Cause nobody can take his place
Well I've been there, we've all been there
And I know how bad it feels
Well it's a big ol' world and I can promise you, girl
It's so good when its real

If you're gonna love somebody
Yeah you better love somebody
Who would keep those pretty blue eyes as dry as the Sahara
If you're gonna love somebody
Yeah you better love somebody
Who ruins your lipstick, not your mascara

The perfect kiss can make a mess
Of the brightest shade of red
Yeah you won't mind a little reapplying
Time and time again
And you'll forget you ever felt like this
When he falls right out of the blue
Oh yeah I swear he's out there somewhere
Looking for you too

If you're gonna love somebody
Yeah you better love somebody
Who would keep those pretty blue eyes as dry as the Sahara
If you're gonna love somebody
Yeah you better love somebody
Who ruins your lipstick, not your mascara
Ohhh
Ohhh

If you're gonna love somebody
Yeah you better love somebody
Who would keep those pretty blue eyes as dry as the Sahara
If you're gonna love somebody
Yeah you better love somebody
Who ruins your lipstick, not your mascara

Ohhh
Oooh if you're gonna love somebody
Yeah you better love somebody
Who ruins your lipstick, not your mascara
