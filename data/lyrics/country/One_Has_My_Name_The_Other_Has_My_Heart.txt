One has my name, the other has my heart
With one I'll remain, that's when my heartaches start
One has brown eyes, the other's eyes are blue
To one I am tied, but to the other I am true
One has my love, the other has only me
But what good is love to a heart that can't be free
So I'll go living my life just the same
While one has my heart and the other has my name
One has my love, the other only me
But what good is love to a heart that can't be free
If I could live over my life I would change
The one who has my heart would also have my name
