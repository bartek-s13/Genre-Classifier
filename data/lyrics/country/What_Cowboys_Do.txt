Broken bones and broken hearts, and I've
Had my shoulder torn apart
But it's nothin' like the pain I felt when I lost you
Honky-tonks and short brown checks
And all those late nights I regret
And I left you all alone, crying, wonderin' why I lay it all on the line

I've earned scars and I've earned buckles
Been in the chutes with blood on my knuckles
I've driven all night long, tryin' to make a rodeo
I'm strong as a freight train, just as steady
Crack the gate, you know I'll be ready
And I'm gonna hang on until the ride is through
'Cause that's what cowboys do

Worn out dually full of whiskey dents, and
Memories of the time we spent
A million miles of blacktop never led me home to you
Eight seconds of pain and fame, and these
Thoughts of you drive me insane
I left you all alone, crying, wonderin' why I lay it all on the line

I've earned scars and I've earned buckles
Been in the chutes with blood on my knuckles
I've driven all night long, tryin' to make a rodeo
I'm strong as a freight train, just as steady
Crack the gate, you know I'll be ready
And I'm gonna hang on until the ride is through
'Cause that's what cowboys do
One day when the glory's gone, and I've
Got no strength to carry on
I'll realize the only thing I should've held on to was you

I've earned scars and I've earned buckles
Been in the chutes with blood on my knuckles
I've driven all night long, tryin' to make a rodeo
I'm strong as a freight train, just as steady
Crack the gate, you know I'll be ready
And I'm gonna hang on until the ride is through
'Cause that's what cowboys do

That's what cowboys do
Broken bones and broken hearts
