Well, I drink too much
And I stay out all night long
If you need someone to blame
Hell, I've always been wrong
Double wells of single malts
I値l twist the truth 'til it's your fault
Twelve-step coins from meetings
Just to live this life

Maybe I知 just a bad guy, I don't know why
But you'll curse the day we met
I'll be your downfall 'til it's last call
And I'm not coming home to you
And I'll break everything you love and make you cry
辰ause baby, I知 just a bad guy

Like these guitar strings
I'll always change my tune
I値l swear to what you want
And I'll promise you the moon
You do your best to change my heart
But broken always falls apart
It won't matter how hard you try
'Cause maybe I知 just a bad guy, I don't know why
But you'll curse the day we met
I'll be your downfall 'til it's last call
And I'm not coming home to you
And I'll break everything you love and make you cry
'Cause baby, I'm just a bad guy

I'll never turn you loose
Or set you free
And when you think of pain, baby
You'll think of me

'Cause I'm just a bad guy, I don't know why
But you'll curse the day we met
I'll be your downfall 'til it's last call
And I'm not coming home to you
And I'll break everything you love and make you cry
'Cause baby, I'm just a bad guy
I'm just a bad guy
