I saw you standing in the middle of the thunder and lightning
I know you're feeling like you just can't win, but you're trying
It's hard to keep on keeping on when you're being pushed around
Don't even know which way is up
You just keep spinnin' down, 'round down

Every storm runs, runs out of rain
Just like every dark night turns into day
Every heartache will fade away
Just like every storm runs, runs out of rain

So hold your head up and tell yourself
That there's something more
And walk out that door
Go find a new rose
Don't be afraid of the thorns
'Cause we all have thorns
Just put your feet up to the edge
Put your face in the wind
And when you fall back down
Keep on rememberin'

Every storm runs, runs out of rain
Just like every dark night turns into day
Every heartache will fade away
Just like every storm runs, runs out of rain
It's gonna run out of pain
It's gonna run out of sting
It's gonna leave you alone
It's gonna set you free, set you free

Every storm runs, runs out of rain
Just like every dark night turns into day
Every heartache will fade away
Just like every storm runs, runs out of rain

It's gonna set you free
It's gonna run out of pain
It's gonna set you free
