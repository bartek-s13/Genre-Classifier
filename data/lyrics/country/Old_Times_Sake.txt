I'm on my third one
So I've got a loose tongue
But if you feel thirsty, I'll buy you one too
At the risk of a cliché
Would it be okay
If we sit together and talk for a few?
Now I usually get home
Before I get too gone
But I don't think stayin' would be a mistake
I love this song too
Could I dance with you?
Let's try something new
For old time's sake
If I had a nickel
For every George Dickel
Silver-tongued promise
Made in this bar
We'd be sittin' and sippin'
On somethin' expensive
Makin' a killin' off desperate hearts
If you didn't know better
You'd think I was clever
Castin' my lines in this neon lake
But I ain't here fishin', I'm just kinda wishin'
We try somethin' new
For old time's sake
It's gettin' on late
We're gettin' on great
It'd be easy to take this way too far
You know I want to
But I think I like you
Enough to just walk you out to your car
Innocent, no
I just know how it could go
If we jump in too quick so I'm willin' to wait
Well this might sound crazy
Old fashioned, maybe
But let's try somethin' new
For old time's sake
Let's try somethin' new
For old time's sake
