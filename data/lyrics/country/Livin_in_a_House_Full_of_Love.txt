Now love is comin' through the window comin' in the door
And I can feel it creepin' through the cracks in the floor
Bouncin' off the walls and the ceiling up above
Since I found you I'm livin' in a house of love
All of my life my heart's been walked on
Women said to love me and my how they talked on
Tellin' me lies and fillin' my eyes with tears that I couldn't control
I couldn't get a hold to myself long enough to realize
They were only tryin' to pull a wool over my eyes
Then I found you and the skies turned blue
And I'm livin' in a house of love
Now love is comin' through the window
Comin'in the door
And I can feel it creepin' through the cracks in the floor
Bouncin' off the walls and the ceiling up above
Since I found you I'm livin' in a house of love
Once I lived in a hole like a rabbit I couldn't find a love and the blues were a habit
A lonely man I couldn't understand why everything I tried went wrong
Then you came along bless your heart and showed me the right way
Dried my eyes and turned my night to day
Since I found youâ€¦my skies turned blue
I'm livin' in a house full of love
Now love is comin' through the window...
Comin' through the door
And I can feel it creepin through the cracks in the floor
Bouncin' off the walls and the ceilings up above
Since I found you, I'm livin' in a house of love
