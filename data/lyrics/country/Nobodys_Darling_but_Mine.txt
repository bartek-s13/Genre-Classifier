Come sit by my side little darling
Come lay your cool hand on my brow
And promise me that you will
Never be nobody's darling but mine
Be nobody's darling but mine
Love be honest be faithful be kind
And promise me that you will
Never be nobody's darling but mine
You're as sweet as the flowers of springtime
You're as pure as the dew from the rose
I had rather be somebody's darlin'
Than a poor boy that nobody knows

Be nobody's darling but mine love
