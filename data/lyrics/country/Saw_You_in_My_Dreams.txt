I know this will sound strange
But I swear I know your name
And I’ll bet you don’t remember where we met
It was here another time
And though this sounds just like a line
You told me things I never will forget
Would you believe I saw you in my dreams
We were dancin’ all alone
We were talkin’ soft and low
I was about to take you home
I woke up and found you gone
Would you believe I saw you in my dreams
There were people all around
But I never heard a sound
Till you broke the spell I heard you say hello
It’s as if somehow you knew
I was waitin’ here for you
And hopin’ for the moment to unfold
Would you believe I saw you in my dreams
We were dancin’ all alone
We were talkin’ soft and low
I was about to take you home
I woke up and found you gone
Would you believe I saw you in my dreams
I don’t pretend to know why things
Work out the way they do
But somewhere in your quiet moments
Do you remember too?
I never wanted it to end
I woke up without my friend
Would you believe I saw you in my dreams
Would you believe I saw you in my dreams
