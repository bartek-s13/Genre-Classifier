We were the wild in the three in the wind
We were the backseat, leaning in
We were the running wild open in the headlights
Hearts on fire in the midnight
We were the slow in the dance in the dust
Jack and Diane with the radio up
We were living and lying about loving and learnin'
In the falling and flying in that summertime thang

We were the song on the radio, playing
We were the words singer was singing
We were the oh, we were the hey
That made you wanna sing along, yeah
We were, we were
We were, we were that song

We were the good and the bye in the rain
We were the lonesome, like a train
We were the let go, we were the hearth broke
We didn't know that it would end this way
We were the almost, yeah but not quite
We were the steel guitars that cry
And lying about loving and leaving
And how lonely that I might've been
I might've been
We were the song on the radio, playing
We were the words singer was singing
We were the oh, we were the hey
That made you wanna sing along, yeah
We were, we were
We were, we were that song
And it goes oh, and it goes oh

We were heard-it-and-I had-to-call
We were the feeling that you can't shake off
That I was a fool and you were the one
How did I ever let you get so gone?

We were the song on the radio, playing
We were the words singer was singing
We were the oh, we were the hey
That made you wanna sing along, yeah
We were, we were
We were, we were that song
And it goes oh, and it goes oh

We were the song on the radio, playing
We were the words singer was singing
We were the oh, we were the hey
That made you wanna sing along, yeah
We were, we were
We were, we were that song
We were, we were
We were, we were that song

And it goes oh, and it goes oh
