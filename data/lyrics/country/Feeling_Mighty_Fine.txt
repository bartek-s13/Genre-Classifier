I woke up this morning feeling fine I woke up with heaven on my mind
I woke up with joy in my soul cause I knew my Lord had control
I knew I was walkin' in the light cause I'd been on my knees in the night
And I'd pray till the Lord gave a sign and now I'm feeling mighty fine
Well I'm feeling mighty fine I've got heaven on my mind
Don't you know I want to go where the milk and honey flow
There's a light that always shines down inside this heart of mine
I've got heaven on my mind and I'm feeling mighty fine
( piano )
We're walking with Jesus all the time we're walking and talking as we climb
We're traveling a road to the sky where I know I'll live when I die
He's been telling me all about that land and he tells me that everything is grand
And he says that a home will be mine and now I'm feeling mighty fine
Oh I'm feeling mighty fine...
Oh I'm feeling mighty fine...
