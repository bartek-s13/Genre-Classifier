Mmm hmm
(V1)
Good southern singing was my upbringing, it was all my daddy did
Bar to bar old guitar, second hand smoke what a way to live
He would close his eyes, when he would harmonize
And he would sing it son (sing it son)
Just spending that time, around him I learned to play it some
(Chorus)
Banging on a hand me down six string
Out on the porch tambourine back-beat praisin’ the Lord
Takes you back in time
It’s a ghost in the radio AM dial
Lonesome Road blues haven't heard in awhile
It's a sweet sound, feelin state of mind
It's in your bloodline
It's in your bloodline
(V2)
There's a time for work and a time for play until play becomes your work
So you sacrifice and roll the dice and hope that you get heard
From a couple of faces to headline stages and everything in between
The pay goes up and the pay goes down down but I. just. keep
(Chorus)
Banging on a hand me down six string
Out on the porch tambourine back-beat praisin’ the Lord
Takes you back in time
It’s a ghost in the radio AM dial
Lonesome Road blues haven't heard in awhile
It's a sweet sound, feelin state of mind
It's in your bloodline
It's in your bloodline

(Bridge)
Can’t run from it, can’t put it down
Can't give it up, can't fight the sound
(Chorus)
Banging on a hand me down six string
Out on the porch tambourine back-beat praisin’ the Lord
Takes you back in time
It’s a ghost in the radio AM dial
Lonesome Road blues haven't heard in awhile
It's a sweet sound, feelin state of mind
It's in your bloodline
It's in your bloodline
