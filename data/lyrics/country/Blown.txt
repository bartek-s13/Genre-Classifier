If you go you go
You go like hell
Don’t look back
Never tell
Stranger is
As stranger does
I’m a stranger now

It rained all night
And the rivers are blown
Feel like forgetting
Whatever I’ve known
I wasn’t born here
But I’ve been here
For a while

You might leave
And never come back
Or never leave
And lose all that
Love cut with wonder
Cut with pain and love
If you go you go
You go like hell
Don’t look back
Never tell
Stranger is
As stranger does
I’m a stranger now

It rained all night
And the rivers are blown
Feel like forgetting
Whatever I’ve known
I wasn’t born here
But I’ve been here
For a while
