I woke up this morning
My head fell dense
I splashed it with water tryin' to make it make sense
I stumbled to the kitchen
She was standing at the sink
All she had to do was just gimme that wink

Slam-bam I'm feelin' alright
Troubles take a hike in the blink of an eye
Don't need to psychoanalyze or have a stiff drink
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink
Well it's her way of sayin' she's on my side
An unspoken message that works every time
When my brain starts smokin'
And I can't even think
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink

Slam-bam I'm feelin' alright
Troubles take a hike in the blink of an eye
Don't need to psychoanalyze or have a stiff drink
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink
In this complicated world
It may sound absurd
But simple little things are the miracle cure
Push to the limit
I'm standin' at the brink
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink

Slam-bam I'm feelin' alright
Troubles take a hike in the blink of an eye
Don't need to psychoanalyze or have a stiff drink
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink
Slam-bam I'm feelin' alright
Troubles take a hike in the blink of an eye
Don't need to psychoanalyze or have a stiff drink
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink
