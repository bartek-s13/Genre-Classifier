There is a river called the river of no return
Sometimes it's peaceful and sometimes wild and free!
Love is a traveler on the river of no return
Swept on forever to be lost in the stormy sea
(Wail-a-ree) I can hear the river call (no return, no return)
Where the roarin' waters fall wail-a-ree
I can hear my lover call "Come to me" (no return, no return)
I lost my love on the river and forever my heart will yearn
Gone, gone forever down the river of no return
Wail-a-ree (Wail-a-ree), wail-a-ree
She'll never return to me! (no return, no return, no return)
