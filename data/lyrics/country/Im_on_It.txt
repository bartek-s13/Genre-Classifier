I know you're rolling down the runway out of LAX
Taking off to wherever you're going next
Doesn't matter that I'm nowhere near that jet
Baby, I'm on it
You know this memory ain't gonna leave you alone
You can try to drown it out with your headphones
But it doesn't really matter what comes on
Baby, I'm on it

Girl, you thought I was gone when you left me
But it's gonna be hard to forget me
Keep telling yourself that it's over
The only over I'll be is over your shoulder
I ain't gonna fade away with the tail lights
Down with the moon, baby, up with the sunrise
Any song, any scene, any old side street
When you think you're rid of me then I'll be

On the wind in the fall when the leaves turn brown
But it's still warm enough to put your windows down
Every cobble stone corner in that college town
Baby, I'm on it
And when you're out at a bar with some new guy
And you end up in his arms at the end of the night
I ought to be the furthest thing from your mind
Yeah but baby, I'm on it

Girl, you thought I was gone when you left me
But it's gonna be hard to forget me
Keep telling yourself that it's over
The only over I'll be is over your shoulder
I ain't gonna fade away with the tail lights
Down with the moon, baby, up with the sunrise
Any song, any scene, any old side street
Baby, I'm on it
Baby, I'm on it


Girl, you thought I was gone when you left me
But it's gonna be hard to forget me
Keep telling yourself that it's over
The only over I'll be is over your shoulder
I ain't gonna fade away with the tail lights
Down with the moon, baby, up with the sunrise
Any song, any scene, any old side street
When you think you're rid of me then I'll be

On any sunny summer white sand beach
Any bed when you just can't fall asleep
Anywhere the road, you're on my league
Baby, I'm on it
Baby, I'm on it
