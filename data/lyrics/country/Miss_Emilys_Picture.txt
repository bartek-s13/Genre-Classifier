I wake up in the morning is a state of fright
On the wrong side of the bed all night
Clinging to the broken heart Inside my head
Open my eyes and I move my hand
From 'round her pillow to the nightstand
And straighten Miss Emily's picture by my bed
Go to the office; the work's piled up
Pour three fingers bourbon in my coffee cup
Cry on my best friend's shoulder down the hall
Feel so lonely, when I close the door
Bite my nails and I walk the floor
And straighten Miss Emily's picture on my wall
Look out my window and what do I see
Nothing but pain looking back at me
All that my future means to me
Is tossing yesterday's love out into the wind
And straighten Miss Emily's picture now and then
I leave my office and I go downtown
To a little bar we all hang around
Laugh drink beer -shoot pool and have a ball
When the laughter stops and the hurt takes hold
Reach in my pocket for my billfold
And show Miss Emily's picture to em' all
I stagger in the house and I slam the door
Scatter my clothes all over the floor
Wishing I could do the same thing in my head
Drink a beer and I eat a bite
And just before I turn out the light
I straighten Miss Emily's picture by my bed
Look out my window and what do I see
Nothing but pain looking back at me
All that my future means to me
Is tossing yesterday's love out into the wind
And straighten Miss Emily's picture now and then
