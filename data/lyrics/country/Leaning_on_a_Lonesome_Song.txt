Borderline crazy. Goin' out of my mind
She said maybe. She'll come back in time
Yeah, but lately.. I'm leanin' on a lonesome song (Leanin' on a lonesome song)
I've been lyin'. (I've been lyin') Been talkin' to myself
I've been dying. (I've been dying) Lookin' around for help
But I'm trying. (But I'm trying) Leanin' on a lonesome song (Leanin' on a lonesome song)
Let those twin fiddles sing. Let that steel guitar twang
Pour me something strong, I'm barely hangin' on
Leanin' on a lonesome song (Leanin' on a lonesome song)
It's in that juke box fillin' up the room
It's like pouring whisky on an open wound
The only thing that helps my heart along (That helps my heart along)
Is leanin' on a lonesome song. (Leanin' on a lonesome song)
Let those twin fiddles sing. Let that steel guitar twang
Pour me something strong, I'm barely hangin' on
I'm leanin' on a lonesome song. (I'm leanin' on a lonesome song)
Leanin' on a lonesome song. (Leanin' on a lonesome song)
Leanin' on a lonesome song. (Leanin' on a lonesome song)
Leanin' on a lonesome song. (Leanin' on a lonesome song)
Borderline crazy, goin' out of my mind
She said maybe. (She said maybe) She'll come back in time
