This house she's holding secrets
Got my change behind the bed
In a coffee can I throw my nickels in
Just in case I have to leave
I will go if you ask me to
I will stay if you dare
If I go I'm going shameless
Let my hunger take me there
This house she's quite the talker
She creaks & moans, she keeps me up
And the photographs know I'm a liar
They just laugh as I burn it down
I will go if you Ask me too
I will stay if you dare
If I go I'm going on fire
Let my anger take me there
And the shingles man they're shaking
Back door is burning through
This old house she's quite the keeper
Quite the keeper of you
I will go if you ask me to
I will stay if you dare
If I go I'm going crazy
Let my darlin' take me there
If I go I'm going crazy
Let my darlin' take me there
