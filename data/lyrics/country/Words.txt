Words, like "hey, nice to meet you"
Got us walking down the street to grab a drink
And words, like "Tell me 'bout your family"
Got us falling, got us landing in a tree
Oh and words, took us all the way from kissin'
In a park and lot to missin
Everything we used to be

Say the words and ill be gone
Turn our perfect lights into another sad song
I won't keep you here
Keep holding on to what we were
Just say the words

Words, well they sure are confusin'
Like when we started using them
Just bullets in a fight
Oh and words, like "Did you ever love me?"
Well they pushed you and they shoved me to the edge of goodbye

Just say the words and ill be gone
Turn our perfect lights to another sad song
I won't keep you here
Keep holding on to what we were
Just say the words

Like bitter poison drippin' off your tongue
Pour the thread and watch the story come undone

Just say the words and ill be gone
Turn our perfect lights to another sad song
I won't keep you here
Keep holding on to what we were
Just say the words

Maybe words, like "I'm sorry and I need you"
Would have been enough to keep you from walking out
Is it too late to say 'em now?
