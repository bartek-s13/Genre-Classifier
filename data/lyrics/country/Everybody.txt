Everybody wants to fall in love, but nobody wants to get hurt
Nobody wants to punch that clock, but everybody wants to get paid
Nobody wants to make love no more everybody just wanna get laid

Everybody wants to be history, but nobody wants to make it
Everybody wants to be in the picture, but nobody wants to take it

Everybody wants to be a superstar
Everybody wants to know what it's like to go driving in a real fast car
