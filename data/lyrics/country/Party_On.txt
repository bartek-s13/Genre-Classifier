Bring on the girls
Break out the wine
Fill up the glasses
This round is mine
There's tunes to play
There's jokes to tell
I need to dance with someone I don't know so well
If we play a louder song
I may not notice that she's gone
Party on,party on
Let's make some noice
Let's tell some lies
Let's cut those big shots
And our bosses down to size
Call all your friends
Let's fill this place
I need a crowd around till I forget her face
I gotta drink my way to strong
To face that empty bed at dawn
Party on, party on
Chances are before the night is over
I'll stare into my glass and call her name
I guarantee if only you had known her
Not one of you would ever be the same
Now, don't rush off
The night is young
I can't remember ever having this much fun
Who needs to sleep
Cause after all
When you've got heartache big as mine there's no last call
She was the one she walked away
There's really nothing left to say
Party on,party on,party on...
