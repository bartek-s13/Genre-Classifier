People whisper behind our back
But we're too young to run this fast
But I'd run through a burning house for you
If you asked me to

If we're the dark horse, I'd place my bet
If we're roulette we'll put it all on red
'Cause red is the colour I'd bleed for you
If you asked me to

I want a love that grows, like a tall jack pine
And I wanna grow old with your hand in mine
Down that road, I'd walk with you
Baby if you ask me to
Baby if you ask me to

If there's a river, long and wide
And you were stranded on the other side
Well, I'd swim that raging river for you
If you asked me to

I want a love that grows, like a tall jack pine
And I wanna grow old with your hand in mine
Down that road, I'd walk with you
Baby if you ask me to
Baby if you ask me to
Tie me a circle from a piece of string
And I will wear it as your ring
No, there ain't nothing I wouldn't give to you
If you asked me to
