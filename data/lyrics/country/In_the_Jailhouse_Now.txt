I had a friend named Ramblin' Bob
Who used to steal, gamble and rob
He thought he was the smartest guy in town
But I found out last Monday
That Bob got locked up Sunday
They've got him in the jailhouse way downtown

He's in the jailhouse now, he's in the jailhouse now
I told him once or twice
To quit playing cards and shooting dice
He's in the jailhouse now
Oh-lay-ee-ee-ee, oh-dee-oh-dee-ee-ee
Ah-dee-oh-lay-ee-ee-dee-del-ee-dee, oh-lay-ee

He played a game called poker
Pinochle, Whist and Euchre
But shooting dice was his greatest game
Now he's downtown in jail
Nobody to go his bail
The judge done said that he refused the fine

He's in the jailhouse now, he's in the jailhouse now
I told him once or twice
To quit playing cards and shooting dice
He's in the jailhouse now
Ah-dee-oh-lay-ee-ee-ee, ah-dee-oh-lay-ee-ee-ee
Ah-dee-oh-lay-ee-ee-dee-del-ee-dee, oh-lay-ee

I went out last Tuesday
Met a girl named Susie
I told her I was the swellest man around
We started to spend my money
Then she started to call me honey
We took in every cabaret in town

We're in the jailhouse now, we're in the jailhouse now
I told the judge right to his face
We didn't like to see this place
We're in the jailhouse now
Ah-dee-oh-lay-ee-ee-ee, ah-dee-oh-lay-ee-ee-ee
Ah-dee-oh-lay-ee-ee-dee, oh-lay-ee
