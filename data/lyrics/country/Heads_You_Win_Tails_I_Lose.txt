Standing on the corner of Heartache and Main
Indicision rainin' down on me
I could stay and I could go but I'm a loser either way
I guess that's just the way it has to be
I've been man enough to tell you that I'm sorry when I'm wrong
You never will admit it when I'm right
Maybe you will finally forgive me when I'm gone
But I won't be there when you apologize
=Chorus=
Heads you win tails I lose
I can't get the upper hand no matter what I do
You'll always be the winner and I'll always be the fool
Heads you win tails I lose
=Chorus=
It used to make you happy just to have me for your own
I was everything you wanted me to be
Now you sit upon your high horse like a princess on her throne
Staring down your nose and finding faults with me
Standing on a mountain I can see from miles around
And the truth is slowly coming into view
Well you want to take me higher but you always keep me down
There just ain't no way nor hope of pleasing you
=Chorus=
Heads you win tails I lose
I can't get the upper hand no matter what I do
You'll always be the winner and I'll always be the fool X2
Heads you win tails I lose
