All around the water tank, waiting for a train
A thousand miles away from home, sleeping in the rain
I walked up to a brakeman to give him a line of talk
He said "If you've got money, I'll see that you don't walk
I haven't got a nickel, not a penny can I shill
"Get off, get off, you railroad bum"
He slammed the boxcar door

Oh-dee-lay-ee, lay-ee, oh-lay-ee

He put me off in Texas, a state I dearly love
The wide open spaces all around me
The moon and stars up above
Nobody seems to want me, or lend me a helping hand
I'm on my way from Frisco, I'm going back to Dixieland
Though my pocket book is empty and my heart is full of pain
I'm a thousand miles away from home just waiting for a train

Oh-dee-lay-ee, lay-ee, oh-lay-ee
