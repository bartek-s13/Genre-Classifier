I'm a little bit lazy
Get a little bit crazy
So many words I need you to say
I'm a little bit restless
Get a little bit reckless
So many things just need you to say
So I'm gonna lay it on the line
Tired of fight'en what I'm feeling deep in side
Laying it on the line
Ohh.. what Ive got to loose
If he takes her hand she is going to leave me here behind
Sitting here talking
To the walls
No body home
So theres no one that I can call
Smoking on cigarettes
Drinking on whiskey
Praying to god
You were right here with me
So I'm gonna laying it on the line
Tired of fighting what I feel deep insidehere
Laying it on the line
Nooo...so what I've got to loose
If he takes her hand she's going to leave me here behind
Leave me behind
