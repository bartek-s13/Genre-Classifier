Parked down at the Sonic, headlights circled up
Jack and Coke on that good ice in a 32-ounce styrofoam cup
Hangin' out with my buddies, talkin' 'bout all the things we did
18 years of memories made of nights just like this
Weekends in a small town, Friday night radio
First truck and a pretty girl, kissin' in the dashboard glow
Saturday there's a six-pack and a hell of a football game
Sunday mornin' back pew Matthew 11:28
Talkin' 'bout weekends in a small town
Weekends in a small town
Fill it up again Tommy, tell us that story again
The one about Amy with her daddy and the gun sayin', "never come back again."
Never thought we'd run out of time, well man we damn sure did
Last three months let's live it up, 'cause when we look back we're gonna miss
Weekends in a small town, Friday night radio
First truck and a pretty girl, kissin' in the dashboard glow
Saturday there's a six-pack and a hell of a football game
Sunday mornin' back pew Matthew 11:28
Talkin' 'bout weekends in a small town
Weekends in a small town
That's right
No matter what happens, no matter how much we change
The one thing I know that will always be the same
Weekends in a small town, Friday night radio
First truck and a pretty girl, kissin' in the dashboard glow
Saturday there's a six-pack and a hell of a football game
Sunday mornin' back pew Matthew 11:28
Talkin' 'bout weekends in a small town
Weekends in a small town
That's Right
