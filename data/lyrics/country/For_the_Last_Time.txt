God knows I've known some lovers in my storied past
But those and all the others they just didn't last
And now I know why for the first time I'm in love
For the last time
My love was like a lyric with no melody
And words are only words if there's no poetry
Now I've found my rhyme for the first time I'm in love
For the last time
So many bridges burned
Without a lesson learned
I thought that I had earned this life alone
But through God's saving grace
And the beauty of your face
My heart has found a place to call my own
I never thought forever'd ever be for me
I could only guess that happiness wasn't meant to be
But now both are mine for the first time I'm in love
For the last time
So many bridges burned
Without a lesson learned
I thought that I had earned this life alone
But through God's saving grace
And the beauty of your face
My heart has found a place to call my own
I never thought forever'd ever be for me
I could only guess that happiness wasn't meant to be
But now both are mine for the first time I'm in love
For the last time
For the first time
I'm in love for the last time
