Spring break down in Panama City, it was two thousand and somethin'
I don't remember a single bar, that we didn't show up drunk in
So when I first kissed her lips, I know she damn sure tasted whiskey
But she didn't seem to mind

I told her I'm from Alabama, she said hell I am too
She said she was a roll tide fan, I said I bleed orange and blue
She said she had a man back home that she'd been leavin' for some time
He lived just across the Georgia line

Well she's all Alabama, but she's got her feet stuck in the Georgia clay
Told me she's from Montgomery, but I've seen those Georgia plates
And every time she gets alone with me, I see Georgia on her mind
Well she's all Alabama, but she's stuck on Georgia time

Well I got a little bit of huntin' land just outside of Phenix City
And even though it's right down the road, she couldn't find the time to see me
Well pretty soon it's just a text she'd send with a line from her favorite song
But I was writin' one of my own

Well she's all Alabama, but she's got her feet stuck in the Georgia clay
And she's got a couple bulldog jerseys, but she's never seen them play
And every time she gets alone with me, I see Georgia on her mind
Well she's all Alabama, but she's stuck on Georgia time
Well she's hung up on another man, and I've done all I can do
She don't seem to understand, that we've got pines here too

Well she's all Alabama, but she's got her feet stuck in the Georgia clay
Told me she's from Montgomery, but I've seen those Georgia plates
And every time she gets alone with me, I see Georgia on her mind
Well she's all Alabama, but she's stuck on Georgia time

She's stuck on Georgia time
