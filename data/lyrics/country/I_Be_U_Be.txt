I'll be the soldier out on the front line
You be the courage in my heart to fight
I'll be the outlaw, bounty on my head
You be my shelter, a safe place to rest

I'll be the weakness, you be the stayin' strong
I'll be the sunrise, you be the all night long

Ah darlin' you're the only perfect part of me
Without you my life is incomplete
Our love's a melody that lingers on
I'll be the singer, you be the song
I'll be the singer, you be, you be the song

I'll be the sinner out in the back row
You be salvation, savin' my soul
I'll be the sailor out on ragin' seas
You be the lighthouse guiding me

I'll be the weakness, you be the stayin' strong
I'll be the sunrise, you be the all night long

Ah darlin' you're the only perfect part of me
Without you my life is incomplete
Our love's a melody that lingers on
I'll be the singer, you be the song
I'll be the singer, you be, you be the song

I'll be the weakness, you be the stayin' strong
I'll be the sunrise, you be the all night long

Ah darlin' you're the only perfect part of me
Without you my life is incomplete
Our love's a melody that lingers on
I'll be the singer, you be the song
I'll be the singer, you be, you be the song
