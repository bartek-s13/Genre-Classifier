When my Savior calls I will answer
When He calls for me I will be there
When my Savior calls I will answer
I'll be somewhere listening for my name
I'll be somewhere listening
I'll be somewhere listening
I'll be somewhere listening for name
I'll be somewhere listening
I'll be somewhere listening
I'll be somewhere listening for my name
If my heart is right when He calls me
If my heart is right I will meet Him
If my heart is right when He calls me
I'll be somewhere listening for my name
I'll be somewhere listening
I'll be somewhere listening
I'll be somewhere listening for name
I'll be somewhere listening
I'll be somewhere listening
I'll be somewhere listening for my name
If my robe is white when He calls me
If my robe is white I will hear
If my robe is white when He calls me
I'll be somewhere listening for my name
I'll be somewhere listening
I'll be somewhere listening
I'll be somewhere listening for name
I'll be somewhere listening
I'll be somewhere listening
I'll be somewhere listening for my name
