There was a time I could drink my cares away
And drown out all of the heartaches that hurt me night and day
When the thought of you came crashin' through, I'd have one more
But now the whiskey ain't workin' anymore
I need one good honky tonk angel to turn my life around
That's reason enough for me to lay this old bottle down
A woman warm and willing, that's what I'm looking for
'Cause the whiskey ain't workin' anymore
They knew my name at every bar in town
And they knew all of the reasons why I was coming round, round, round (sing it, Travis)
'Cause in my mind, peace I'd find, when they'd start to pour
But now the whiskey ain't workin' anymore (sing it, son)
I need one good honky tonk angel to turn my life around
That's reason enough for me to lay this old bottle down
Well, a woman warm and willing, Lord, that's what I'm looking for (that's right)
'Cause the whiskey ain't workin' anymore
Lord, the whiskey ain't workin' anymore
That's for sure
