They say all good love is written in the stars
And what's meant to be won't be torn apart
It's been you and me from the very start
And they said that we'd never get this far

Still you hold on in the dark times
Still you stay strong, you always find a way to love me through
Never give up and never let me go
It takes a bulletproof heart to love me, to love me like you do

People spend their lives looking for this love
Never let you down, never give you up
And after all these years, chasing crazy dreams
You're the one that never loses faith in me

Still you hold on in the dark times
Still you stay strong, you always find a way to love me through
Never give up and never let me go
It takes a bulletproof heart to love me, to love me like you do

Still you hold on in the dark times
Still you stay strong, you always find a way to love me through
Never give up and never let me go
It takes a bulletproof heart to love me, to love me like you do
To love me like you do
