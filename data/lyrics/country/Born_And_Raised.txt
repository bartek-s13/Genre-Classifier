I hear the sound of a gravel road
I feel the wheels of a Detroit steel takin' me home
I see the house just up ahead
Sing to the one, my daddy's son will lie awake in bed

And dream myself to sleep
And pray my soul to keep

Plowed dirt, white shirts, blue collar roots
Still runnin' through my veins
I was born small town, deep roots
Mud on these boots
I wouldn't change a thing
It's how I was born and raised
(born and raised, born and raised)
(born and raised)
Born and raised

I'll never leave this little town
The family, the memories, the roots that I put down
Know who I am, ain't gonna change
Might find a brand new melody but the song remains the same

I'm proud of where I'm from
Yeah we're the lucky ones

Plowed dirt, white shirts, blue collar roots
Still runnin' through my veins
I was born small town, deep roots
Mud on these boots
I wouldn't change a thing
It's how I was born and raised
(born and raised, born and raised, born and raised)
Born and raised
It's how I was born and raised
(born and raised, born and raised, born and raised)
Born and raised
It's how I was born and raised

I know that gravel road will always lead me home
Somewhere that shooting star points me to where you are
I know that gravel road will always lead me home
Somewhere that shooting star points me to where you are

Plowed dirt, white shirts, blue collar roots
Still runnin' through my veins
I was born small town, deep roots
Mud on these boots
I wouldn't change a thing
It's how I was born and raised
(born and raised, born and raised, born and raised)
Born and raised
It's how I was born and raised
(born and raised, born and raised, born and raised)
Born and raised
(It's how I was born and raised)
I'll never leave this little town
