If Jesus comes tomorrow to spend some time with you
Would you answer all His questions or lie to hide the truth
Would you welcome Him with open arms or even let Him in
If Jesus comes tomorrow what then
If Jesus calls your number could you leave today
Are you ready to lay down your worldly goods and walk away
Would it take a month of Sundays just to tell Him of your sin
If Jesus comes tomorrow what then
If the sky turns black as midnight in the middle of the day
And somehow you knew that Jesus would soon be on His way
Would you have to beg forgiveness or could you reach out and take His hand
If Jesus comes tomorrow what then
