I've been so color blind
And I've been so color blind (haha, yeah)

Ayy, trips to the mall, I just tripped in the fall
I think I might really be the one after all, yeah
The one to rule them all, I'm the chosen one, the savior
But all these triple six, yeah
Make it look like I was up to no good
At least that's what my momma said, yeah
Now I'm the one givin' momma bread
Done with the pain, I'm just so heartless

I've been so color blind
And I've been so color blind

(I said)

Love don't cost a thing, yeah
So all my girls need diamond rings, yeah, yo, yo
Text that I sent that you never ever read
Got me feelin' like you never ever ever really cared, yeah
But that's okay though
I hope you feel okay though
They used to call me Diego
My favorite drink is Faygo
I've been so so so-

(I said)
(I said)
I've been so color blind
I've been so color blind

I've been so color blind
And I've been so color blind
