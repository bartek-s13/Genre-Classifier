While the storm clouds gather
Far across the sea
Let us swear allegiance
To a land that's free
Let us all be great full
For a land so fair
Let us raise our voices
In a solemn prayer
God bless America
Land that I love
Stand beside her, and guide her
Through the night with the light from above
From the mountains, to the prairies
To the oceans, white with foam
God bless America
My home sweet home
God bless America
My home sweet home
From the mountains, to the prairies
To the oceans, white with foam
God bless America
My home sweet home
God bless America
My home sweet home
