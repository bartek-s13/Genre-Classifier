Ahem, yeah!

Waltz around the room
With a glaze in your stare
In your tuxedo suit
I'll give it a name
Lower defenses
I'll lower the casket
Open the door
Open the grave

Murder, murder
Murder, murder

Now you're doing the waltz with your murderer
Doing the waltz with your murderer
Doing the waltz with your murderer
You're doing the waltz with your murderer
Doing the waltz with your murderer
You're doing the waltz with your murderer
You're doing the waltz with your murderer
You're doing the waltz with your murderer
Woah, yeah

Waltz around the room
With a glaze in your stare
Tuxedo suit
Give it a name
Lower defenses
Lower the casket
Open the door
Open the grave

Mediocrity is the killer
Mediocrity is the killer
Mediocrity is the killer
Mediocrity is the killer

You find yourself helpless, oh
Christ is not a fashion
Fleeting away

Fashion, fashion, fashion

He laid emeralds in her eyes
Oh, but I'd already tried
A bracelet made of gold
And scarlet thread around her wrist
And everything was wrong
So we sang sentimental songs
Oh, how seldom we belong
But how elegant our kiss
And we painted crooked lines
But we danced in perfect time
To a love so much refined
We know not what it is
So like the dullen wine
We pour into a grief we'd known before
But never quite like this
Never quite like this
All I know now is regret
She follows like a silhouette
On the cobblestone behind me
She has nothing left to say
Except to innocently ask
Her voice delicate as glass
"Do you see me when we pass?"
But I
I continue on my way
