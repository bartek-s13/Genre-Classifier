Take the red eye to Raleigh
Ring your doorbell at dawn
We can crawl back in bed it'll be like I was never gone
They say that time heals all, thats the easy part
Cus it sure does hurt just waiting on a broken heart
My broken heart
Your leaving was the easy part
Since then I'm just a body with a broken heart
Please tell me you're on vacation, I know you must be gone
Cus I keep leavin' you messages acting like there's nothing wrong
They say it's a small world, that's just a place to start
Cus it sure looks bigger when I'm looking through a broken heart
My broken heart, every injured Ventricle
My broken heart, oh it leaves me pitiful
I remeber the parting shot in the parking lot that finally tore it apart
Since then I'm just a body with a broken heart
If feels against my nature, just put me in the zoo
Baby I'm not a mammal that can handle gettin' over you
They say to trust in science for what the body needs so sign me up for experimental laparoscopic cardiology
Oh my broken heart, every aching atrium, my broken heart, oh you wasted em, I remember you parting shot in the parking lot that finally tore it apart
Since then I'm just a body with a broken heart
I'll take the red eye to raleigh
Ring your doorbell at dawn, I can wait outside and pray somebodies home
They say to count your blessing and I know where to start
I can feel you with every beat of my broken heart
Oh my broken heart, every injured ventricle
My broken heart, it leaves me pitiful
I remember your parting shot in the parking lot that finally tore it apart
Since then I'm just a body with a broken heart
Since then I'm just a body with a broken heart
