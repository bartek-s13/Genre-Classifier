You say 'I love you'
I say 'me too'
We don't think much about it
It's just a thing that we do
We go out walking
We don't talk much
We lie down together
But our hearts never touch

Oh baby it's a hard way
It's an eternity
Got the life that we wanted
Not the love that we need

We never go to bed angry
Cause we never fight
Yeah we never go crazy
In the middle of the night
We could stay here forever
Just holding on
We both had our reasons
But our reasons are gone
Oh baby it's a hard way
It's an eternity
Got the life that we wanted
Not the love that we need

In our hearts we knew better
But we couldn't let go
Now it's time to quit our hiding
What we've always known
If something was missing
We were too scared to look
Too busy telling our stories
Instead of writing the book

Oh baby it's a hard way
It's an eternity
Got the life that we wanted
Not the love that we need
Oh baby it's a hard way
It's an eternity
Got the life that we wanted
Not the love that we need
