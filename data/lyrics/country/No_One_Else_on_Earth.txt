I've been a rock and I've got my fences, I never let them down
When it comes to love, I keep my senses, I don't get kicked around
I shivered once, you broke into my soul, the damage is done now
I'm out of control, how did you get to me

No one else on earth could ever hurt me
Break my heart the way you do
No one else on earth was ever worth it
No one could love me like
No one could love me like you

You can make me want you anytime you want to, you're burning me alive
I can't deny you even when I catch you, weaving a weak alibi
'Cause when the night falls you make me forget your love is killing me
And it ain't over yet, how did you get to me

No one else on earth could ever hurt me
Break my heart the way you do
No one else on earth was ever worth it
No one could love me like
No one could love me like you


I shivered once, you broke into my soul
The damage is done now
I'm out of control
How did you get to me

No one else on earth could ever hurt me
Break my heart the way you do
No one else on earth was ever worth it
No one could love me like
No one could love me like

No one else on earth could ever hurt me
Break my heart the way you do
No one else on earth was ever worth it
No one could love me like
No one could love me like you

No one else on earth was ever worth it
No one could love me like, no one like you
No one like you
