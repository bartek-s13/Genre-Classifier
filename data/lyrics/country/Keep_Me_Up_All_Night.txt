Be my hot pot of coffee, baby
Keep me up all night
A full moon through my window shining
A little too bright
Baby, remember what it's like
Keep me up all night
Be my alley dog barking at the breeze
That won't let me sleep
Sometimes a lack of shut eye
Is just what a body needs
Baby remember what it's like
Keep me up all night
Let's Outrun the sandman
Forget about the time
Cast that old spell on me
Just by looking at my eyes
We'll light a little fire
And watch the sparks fly
We may be a little sleepy
Come the sunrise
Oh, remember what it's like
Keep me up all night
Be my summer church tent revival
Lead me back to the light
Let the spirit move us, Hallelujah
When we get it right
I swear by tomorrow morning, I won't mind
Keep me up all night
Let's Outrun the sandman
Forget about the time
Cast that old spell on me
Just by looking at my eyes
We'll light a little fire
And watch the sparks fly
We may be a little sleepy
Come the sunrise
Oh, remember what it's like
Keep me up all night
