Some memories never fade
Some broken hearts just stay that way
Some dreams just aren't meant to be
But you keep, holdin' on, long after she's gone

That's why they make Jack Daniels
Two fingers in a glass
It ain't gonna make it any better
But, it won't hurt as bad

Some scars time won't heal
Some goodbyes that you're still gonna feel
Some ghost just keeps comin' back, from the past
And it won't, ever let you move on

That's why they make Jack Daniels
Two fingers in a glass
It ain't gonna make it any better
But, it won't hurt as bad

Some nights just never end
Sometimes I need to forgive you again

That's why they make Jack Daniels
Two fingers in a glass
It ain't gonna make it any better
But, it won't hurt as bad

It ain't gonna make it any better
But, it won't hurt as bad
