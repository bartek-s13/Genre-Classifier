Girl you never looked better than you do in that black dress
I can't stop my eyes from riding the lines of your silhouette
And that sunset sinking down low's got me thinking
What we both know, we both know
That the bedroom’s calling our name up the hall and
We both know where it's gonna go

Your body, on mine
Red painted nails running up my spine and
Your hair, dropped down
You're rocking my flannel while we're foolin' around
And we'll blame it on the red wine if ya wanna
Take it nice and slow yeah you know we're gonna
Pull those shades down tight, make it last all night
Girl we're gonna be here for awhile

That pretty little lip bite, half smile, looking so reckless
With your eyes locked on mine, between you and I there's no secrets
Ain't a thought that we're gonna have to hold back baby
When we let it go, just let it go

Your body, on mine
Red painted nails running up my spine and
Your hair, dropped down
You're rocking my flannel while we're foolin' around
And we'll blame it on the red wine if ya wanna
Take it nice and slow yeah you know we're gonna
Pull those shades down tight, make it last all night
Girl we're gonna be here for awhile
(Yeah we're gonna be here for awhile)

And we’ll blame it on the red wine if ya wanna
Take it nice and slow yeah you know we’re gonna
Pull those shades down tight, make it last all night

Your body, on mine
Red painted nails running up my spine and
Your hair, dropped down
You're rocking my flannel while we're foolin' around
And we'll blame it on the red wine if ya wanna
Take it nice and slow yeah you know we're gonna
Pull those shades down tight, make it last all night
Girl we're gonna be here for awhile
(Yeah we're gonna be here for awhile)
