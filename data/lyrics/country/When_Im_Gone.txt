I am a man half a century from home
These calloused hands served their master well
Dear, nothing is the matter
We plow our fields and scatter in the wind
To end our days alone
I remember crawling into Grandma's open arms
And hiding in the blanket by her feet
She said "We're all each other's neighbors
Searching for a saviour to lead us home
On the day we leave."
When I'm gone, don't you think of me
Don't you place a rose upon my stone
Promise me you'll never weep
Tell the chldren I'm asleep
And sing "Holy, holy, holy" as I make my journey home
Won't you bury me in the Carolina clay
It's seeped into my fingers anyway
This ground is someting hallow, bury me shallow
Let me feel the tapping of the rain
We'll never know the place we all would go from here
Be still, my soul, bring the hour near
We see the world in flashes
Ashes all to ashes, dust to dust
We've come to disappear
When I'm gone, don't you think of me
Don't you place a rose upon my stone
Promise me you'll never weep
Tell the chldren I'm asleep
And sing "Holy, holy, holy" as I make my journey home
And sing "Holy, holy, holy" as I make my journey home
