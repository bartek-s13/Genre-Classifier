Tangled up in hotel sheets, three sheets to the wind
Kicking myself, staring at this cross on my skin
Too jacked up to just blackout in this mess of a bed I made
With some girl I'll just call Omaha 'cause I forgot her name
And there's a preacher on a TV
Saying something about You coming back soon
Got me thinking about if You walked in now, what the hell I'd do

I wish I was on a plane
Or hopping trains
Standing with my thumb in the air
Waving down a cab somewhere
Right now I don't wanna be caught in room 316
With a hotel bible as a coaster underneath my beer
Lord, if You decide tonight's the night You're coming back
I hope You don't find me here

If I get down on my knees and it ain't too much to ask
Could you break the chains that hold me down
Get the devil off my back
And if you're gonna split that eastern sky
I pray you take your time
I promise you I'll make these old boots walk a straight line

I wish I was on a plane
Or hopping trains
Standing with my thumb in the air
Waving down a cab somewhere
Right now I don't wanna be caught in room 316
With a hotel bible as a coaster underneath my beer
Lord, if You decide tonight's the night You're coming back
I hope You don't find me here

There's a preacher on a TV
Saying something about You coming back soon
I ain't got doubt if You walked in now
Man I'd be screwed

I wish I was on a plane
Or hopping trains
Standing with my thumb in the air
Waving down a cab somewhere
Right now I don't wanna be caught in room 316
With a hotel bible as a coaster underneath my beer
Lord, if You decide tonight's the night You're coming back
I hope You don't find me here
I hope You don't find me here

Tangled up in hotel sheets, three sheets to the wind
Kicking myself, staring at this cross on my skin
