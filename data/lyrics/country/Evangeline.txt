She stands on the banks of the mighty Mississippi
Alone in the pale moonlight
Waiting for a man, a riverboat gambler
Said that he'd return tonight
They used to waltz on the banks of the mighty Mississippi
Loving the whole night through
He was a riverboat gambler off to make a killing
And bring it on back to you

Evangeline, Evangeline
Curses the soul of the Mississippi Queen
That pulled her man away

Bayou Sam from South Louisiana
Had gambling in his veins
Evangeline from the maritime
Was slowly going insane
High on the top of Hickory Hill
She stands in the lightning and thunder
Down on the river, the boat was a-sinking
She watched that Queen go under

Evangeline, Evangeline
Curses the soul of the Mississippi Queen
That pulled her man away
Evangeline, Evangeline
Curses the soul of the Mississippi Queen
That pulled her man away
