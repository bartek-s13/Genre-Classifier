Baby I know it's late but
I've been lying here wide awake just
Thinking 'bout me and you
This might come out of the blue
I can't go another night just
Keeping all of this inside
I don't know if you have doubts
If you do let me lay this out
Is the way I feel ever gonna fade
Is my heart ever gonna want to run away
Down the road, let you go
Hell no
Could I ever make it thru this life
Without you right here by my side, heaven knows
Hell no
If there's one thing you can trust it's
I ain't ever giving up on us no
No matter what we're up against
We're gonna make it that's the way it is
Is the way I feel ever gonna fade
Is my heart ever gonna want to run away
Down the road let you go
Hell no
Could I ever make it thru this life
Without you right here by my side, heaven knows
Hell no
Hell no
Is the way I feel ever gonna fade
Is my heart ever gonna want to run away
Down the road, let you go
Hell no
Could I ever make it thru this life
Without you right here by my side, heaven knows
Hell no
Baby I know it's late
But I've been lying here wide awake
