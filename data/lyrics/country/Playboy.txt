They call me a playboy as I'm making my rounds
Chasing the bright lights of each nightspot in town
Though I never show it my heart's breaking in two
They may call me a playboy but I'm just lonesome for you
I once had a real love that was when I had you
Now I'll never feel love with somebody new
This clothes that I'm wearing it's just to cover my blues
They call me the playboy but I'm just lonesome for you
I once had a real love...
