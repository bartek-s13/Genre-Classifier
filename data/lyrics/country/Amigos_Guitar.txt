Tonight they're singing in the villas
Tomorrow you'll be gone so far
Hold me close and say you love me
While Amigo plays his blue guitar
Ay, ay, ay, ay
The moon is lonely
Tomorrow I'll wonder where you are
Ma-na-na morning, my darling
I'll be blue as Amigo's guitar
They've hushed their singing in the villas
All is quiet beneath the stars
Amigo plays Hasta Luego
Upon his lonely blue guitar
Ay, ay, ay, ay
The moon is lonely...
