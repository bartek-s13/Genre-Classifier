Oh yeah
Ain't gonna lie, I can count on both hands
My down to ride 'til the day I die friends
To get them, I'd like to think
That I'm few and far between
Guys like me, you want in an alley with ya
Up a creek, ain't a doubt I'm gonna paddle with ya
Go to bat, go to church, go to battle with ya
They can say what they want about me, but

The ones that need me got me
The ones that doubt me can't stop me
Even the ones that said, “Forget him.”
You can bet they ain't forgot me
Either wanna hit me or hold me
Those that hate me don't know me
And the ones that don't trust anybody trust me
Yeah, the ones that like me love me

Speak my mind, don't mind who's listenin'
I'll ask forgiveness, 'fore I ask permission
Least with me you know what you're gettin'
You may not get a thing about me, but

The ones that need me got me
The ones that doubt me can't stop me
Even the ones that said, “Forget him.”
You can bet they ain't forgot me
Either wanna hit me or hold me
Those that hate me don't know me
And the ones that don't trust anybody trust me
Yeah, the ones that like me love me

Yeah, they love me
And I ain't perfect, I'm a simple man
I got a sinner's mind, but I can fold my hands
I ain't afraid to pray and I do know who I am, yeah

And the ones that need me got me
Ones that doubt me can't stop me
Even the ones that said, “Forget him.”
Bet your ass they ain't forgot me
Either wanna hit me or hold me
Those that hate me don't know me
And the ones that don't trust anybody trust me
Yeah, the ones that like me love me

The ones that like me love me
And if you don't
Probably a pretty good chance I don't like you either
