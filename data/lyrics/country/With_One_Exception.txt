I've seen lots of pretty faces in a million different places
And it's hard for me to keep from doing wrong
Cause you're the cutest and the sweetest you always dress the neatest
With one exception and she's waiting at home
If I let temptation fill me I know your kiss would thrill me
And how easy it would be to lead you on
You're such a lovely girl you're perfect for my world
With one exception and she's waiting at home
Sometimes I almost cheated after all I'm just a man
Can't you see my world is wrapped up in a golden wedding band
I'd beg steal or borrow and you'd be mine tomorrow
With one exception and she's waiting at home
Yes I'd beg steal or borrow and you'd be mine tomorrow
With one exception and she's waiting at home
