Scars on my eyes crown full of thorns
Head in the skies when it rains only pours
Hearts in a casket gun in my basket
I'm numb to the sun but I've been here before
And I don't chase dreams I run from nightmares
And I got many friends, and they don't fight fair
God bless the jackals as they sleep when my
Body lays numb give the wolves something to eat
And I can feel it
Through the holes in the cracks in the ceiling
I'm forgiven
The small boy who grasped to his toy
While the world tore apart I was built to destroy
You're leaving, and I'm a demon
But my horns don't show
And my eyes won't close
And the noose won't hold
And my mind won't fold
I'll be here till the end
Till the skies don't glow

I carved a message in my hand saying “save me”
I carved a message in my arm saying “help”
I been stuck inside my shell
I need patience I'm in hell
And all the angels gather round
And then they laugh just as I fell
Tryna fill my heart falling closer to the edge
Reaching out to all these people who
Said they were my friends
Oh god, they're not calling back
Lifelines going dim
Like my head
Like the rest
Like my fucking beating chest, oh

If I wanna die I should probably not own a pistol
A piece for peace just fucking up all my mental
Never said that I was safe
Never said that I was home
I'm just sittin' in my car on this hilltop alone
Hands shaking blowing camels up into the sky
You know i miss you while I'm cradling this .45
Hammer cocked back wondering if angels fly
Hammer cocked back wondering if angels cry
Fuck it off that take me up into the sky
Tears drying while i’m taking time to say goodbye
Hold tight

Keep going going going
Don’t fly away
You know you know know it
I tried to stay
They said i'd cycle backwards
I feel the sway
Back and forth so fuck it
I’ll fly away

Yo what's up man uh
I hope everything is good
I, I was just calling
'Cause your mom said
You never came home last night
And uh
Look I know it's tough
I loved him too
We all loved him
Very much
You know that I
I just hope you're okay
Alright?
I don't wanna lose you too
Just uh
Give me a call when you get this message, alright?
Fuck
