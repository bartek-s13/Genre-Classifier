I pulled up in that two-tone single cab me and Dad fixed
Four by four with a four inch lift
Just high enough that I had to help her in
Maybe it was that cracked windshield but I couldn't see
Where that goin’ nowhere ride would lead
I sure didn't think it would end with a kiss
'Til it did

Could’ve been the right song came on the radio
The first time she got to drive off road
And got her holdin' on to me that night
It could've been the Glasspack twin-stacked tailpipes
Still don't know why she fell for my sun beach bench seat
Four-wheel-drive don't lie pick-up lines

I don't remember those words I said comin' out smooth
But I must've been makin’ all the right moves right up to my favorite part
Where she said throw it in park

Could’ve been the right song came on the radio
The first time she got to drive off road
And got her holdin' on to me that night
It could’ve been the Glasspack twin-stacked tailpipes
Still don't know why she fell for my sun beach bench seat
Four-wheel-drive don't lie pick-up lines, yeah
Yeah, well that full moon is sneakin' through the back glass
We set the night on fire with a half tank of gas

Could’ve been the right song came on the radio
The first time she got to drive off road
And got her holdin' on to me that night
It could've been the Glasspack twin-stacked tailpipes
Still don't know why she fell for my sun-bleached bench seat
Four-wheel-drive don't lie pick-up lines
Hey!
Yeah my pick-up lines
She fell for my sun-bleached bench seat
Four-wheel-drive don't lie pick-up lines
Oh yeah
