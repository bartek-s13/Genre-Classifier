Those tears in your eyes
Got me seein' red
I hate the way they get to you
With all the lies they spread
Ain't that small town talk
Like the devil on your shoulder
It gets old girl
It gets so old girl

Just let 'em talk, let 'em talk baby
'Cause girl I don't give a damn what they say
You're the one, the reason God made me
I'm gonna love you anyway
And when it hurts
Just know we're gonna make it work
I got your back
You got my heart, girl
No matter what, you've gotta remember
It's you and me against the world

They're gonna throw sticks and stones
Try to tear us right in two
'Cause baby, we got what they want
And what we got's the truth
So let 'em do what they're gonna do
Yeah baby, we can take it
We're gonna make it
Yeah we're gonna make it
Girl
Just let 'em talk, let 'em talk baby
'Cause girl I don't give a damn what they say
You're the one, the reason God made me
I'm gonna love you anyway
'Cause when it hurts
Just know we're gonna make it work
I got your back
You got my heart, girl
No matter what, you've gotta remember
It's you and me against the world
Let 'em talk, let 'em talk baby
'Cause girl I don't give a damn what they say
You're the one, the reason God made me
I'm gonna love you anyway
'Cause when it hurts
Just know we're gonna make it work
I got your back
You got my heart, girl
No matter what, you've got to remember
It's you and me against the world
And I don't give a damn what they say
