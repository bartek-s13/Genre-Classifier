I don't think that I'll ever forget the winter of '72
It must have been the coldest year that I ever knew
I left my home in Dallas to head out for Idaho
Before I reached Colorado I hit three feet of snow
Chorus:
Singing Lord, let the wind blow you know I'm so cold
Rock Springs to Cheyenne is a bad stretch I've been told
2 o'clock in the morning on Thanksgiving Day
It's a damn good thing I'm a God fearing man
I've been forced to pray
Yeah it's a damn good thing I'm a God fearing man
I've been forced to pray
There's a little dog riding by my side
And he's shivering just like me
And Lord I'm kind of glad it's dark outside
Cause there really ain't nothing to see
I kinda wish I had a radio to take my mind off you
I got my hands on the wheel of something that's real
And my fingers are turning blue
Chorus
I learned a lesson in Denver and again in San Antone
There's lies in California
And you know the truth's in Mountain Home
How can you trust your brother
When you can't even trust yourself
And your love's what keeps your woman
From being with somebody else
Chorus
