Oh, beautiful star of Bethlehem
Shining afar through shadows dim
Giving the light for those who long have gone
Guiding the wise men on their way
Unto the place where Jesus lay
Oh, beautiful star of Bethlehem, shine on

Oh, beautiful star of Bethlehem
(Beautiful, beautiful star, star of Bethlehem)
Shine upon us until the glory dawns
Give us the light to light the way
Unto the land of perfect day
Oh, beautiful star of Bethlehem, shine on
(Shine on)

Oh, beautiful star, the hope of life
Guiding the pilgrims through the night
Over the mountains until the break of dawn
Into the light of perfect day
It will give out a lovely ray
Oh, beautiful star of Bethlehem, shine on
Oh beautiful star, the hope of rest
For the redeemed, the good and the blessed
Yonder in glory when the crown is won
Jesus is now that star divine
Brighter and brighter He will shine
Beautiful Star of Bethlehem, shine on
(Shine on)
