Everything seems okay right now
Bottom of the sky hasn't fallen out
But I know when it comes, it's gonna get ugly, get ugly
You don't know you as well as I do
So baby, don't wait a week or two
Go and pull the Band-Aid off
We'll both be better off if you just

Come on and hate me
Tell me you regret you ever met me
Make sure that it hurts right as I'm leaving
Make me believe that
You never even really ever loved me
Come on, baby, hate me

Don't need those coffee mugs from Portland
Don't need that sweater from your drawer
Don't need you to chase me down the stairs and out the door, no
Don't need to hear, "I'm sorry"
Don't need your version of the truth
There is only one thing left that I need from you

So come on, come on and hate me
Tell me you regret you ever met me
Make sure that it hurts right as I'm leaving
Make me believe that
You never even really ever loved me
Come on, baby, hate me
Come on, baby, hate me
I know you're not much for crying
So why go start right now, why go start right now?
I'm just trying to make it easy on you, on me

Come on and hate me
Tell me you regret you ever met me
Make sure that it hurts right as I'm leaving
Make me believe that
You never even really ever loved me
Come on, baby, hate me, oh-oh
Come on, baby, hate me
Hate me, hate me

Don't say you're sorry, baby, just say you hate me
(Come on, baby, hate me)
Don't say you're gonna miss me, just say you hate me
Don't say you're sorry, baby, just say you hate me
Don't say you're gonna miss me, just say you hate me
