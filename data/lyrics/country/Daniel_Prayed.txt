I read about a man one day
He wasted not his time away
He prayed to God
Every morning, noon and night
He cared not for the things of Baal
But trusted One who never fails
Oh Daniel prayed
Every morning, noon and night
Oh, Daniel served his living God
While upon this earth he trod
He prayed to God every morning, noon and night
He cared not for the king's decree
But trusted God who set him free
Oh Daniel prayed
Every morning, noon and night
They locked him in the lion's den
Because he would not honor men
But he prayed to God
Every morning, noon and night
The jaws were locked, it made him shout
And God soon brought him safely out
Oh, Daniel prayed
Every morning, noon and night
Oh, Daniel served his living God
While upon this earth he trod
He prayed to God every morning, noon and night
He cared not for the king's decree
But trusted God who set him free
Oh Daniel prayed
Every morning, noon and night
Now brother let us watch and pray
Like Daniel did from day to day
He prayed to God
Every morning, noon and night
We too can gladly dare and do
And pray to God, He'll see us through
Oh, Daniel prayed
Every morning, noon and night
Oh, Daniel served his living God
While upon this earth he trod
He prayed to God every morning, noon and night
He cared not for the king's decree
But trusted God who set hime free
Oh Daniel prayed
Every morning, noon and night
