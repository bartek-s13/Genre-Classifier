If I were alone in the desert
Without a drink of water around
With my knees and hands in that white scorching sand
With the hot Sahara sun beating down
If I could be granted my wishes
And anything I want would come true
Well, I know that it might sound funny
But here's what I want you to do

Tell Lorrie I love her
Tell Lorrie I need her
Tell her everything would be okay
If I could just see her
Tell Lorrie I love her
Tell Lorrie I need her
And if I leave this old world
Tell her she's the only girl for me

If I were adrift on the ocean
A vessel with no sails or steam
Floating aimlessly on an endless sea
Hopelessly lost, it would seem
If all of the fish in the water
Could echo my last dying plea
Well I know you might not understand it
But here's what I want it to be
Tell Lorrie I love her
Tell Lorrie I need her
Tell her everything would be okay
If I could just see her
Tell Lorrie I love her
Tell Lorrie I need her
And if I leave this old world
Tell her she's the only girl for me
And if I leave this old world
Tell her she's the only girl for me
