We grew up fast but roots go deep
To pull them out makes us bleed
We knew this was coming
We tried to outrun it
It's a little bit bittersweet
You ain't gonna be next to me
I don't know where this dream will lead
I'm a little bit scared of my heart beating like a drum
Coming undone, beat-beating like a drum

Woah, with all that we've been through
Memories we can't lose
In my dreams, we're running, too
How can I say goodbye to you?
Woah, and though I know it's time
I can't believe tonight I will say goodbye
Say goodbye to you

One hand in yours, one to the sky
Let's both let go so we can fly, fly

Woah, with all that we've been through
Memories we can't lose
In my dreams, we're running, too
How can I say goodbye to you?
Woah, and though I know it's time
I can't believe tonight I will say goodbye
Say goodbye to you
Woah, with all that we've been through
Memories we can't lose
In my dreams, we're running, too
How can I, how can I?

Woah, with all that we've been through
Memories we can't lose
In my dreams, we're running, too
How can I say goodbye to you?
Woah, and though I know it's time
I can't believe tonight I will say goodbye
Say goodbye to you

We grew up fast but roots go deep
To pull them out makes us bleed
We knew this was coming
So let's keep running
