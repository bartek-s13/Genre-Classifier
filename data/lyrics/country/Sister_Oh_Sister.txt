Sister, oh, sister
I miss your shadow
I miss your shade
When I was afraid
You pulled me through
Sister, big sister
You set the standard
You set the curve
You showed the nerve
When I needed you

Those old Pennebaker boys
Stop making all that noise
And you beat 'em
To the dirt without blinking
My fists flew in the air
'Cause I knew that you'd be there
To grab 'em by the shirt
Without thinking

Sister, oh, sister
The whole house in shambles
You stood straight as a bean
You made a whole team
Out of me and you

A time we stole a car
You tried to sneak me in a bar
When I was barely twelve
And you were fourteen
Cross that parking lot expanse
On those oyster shells we dance
Whilst some cowboy watched you twisting
Through the porch screen

Sister, oh, sister
You been my sea wall
You been my blood
Your in my blood
I thank God for you
