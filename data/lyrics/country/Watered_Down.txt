I don’t go all in but I’ll take a gamble
And I don’t burn both ends of the candle anymore
I take the corners, slower and steady
This chip on my shoulder, it ain’t so heavy anymore

We still fly like gypsies, just a little closer to the ground
We still love our whiskey, but now it’s just a little watered down

Couple girls I could’ve married, I married someone else
These torches I still carry don’t burn like hell the way they used to
The back side of 40 ain’t near as crazy
And Sunday morning ain’t near as hazy anymore

We still fly like gypsies, just a little closer to the ground
We still love our whiskey, but now it’s just a little watered down

Those old ghosts still chase me
But feels like they’re losing ground
Yeah I’m still crazy
But now I’m just a little watered down
