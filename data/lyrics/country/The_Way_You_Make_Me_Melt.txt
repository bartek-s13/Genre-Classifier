I don't have to hold your hand
But you don't know
You always seem to understand
But I don't show
You don't wait for me to say but I need
Take me where my heart's already going
I've been waitin' there so long
Your just cathcin' up to me
Skin on my skin
Hands on my face
Feeling your lips all over the place
I thought I knew
But I never felt
Oh, the way you make me melt
I can just sit and watch you smile
You're beautiful
I swear the world stops spinnin' 'round
You turn me on
Skin on my skin
Hands on my face
Feeling your lips all over the place
I thought I knew
But I never felt
Oh, the way you make me melt
The way you make me melt
I never want this to end
Over and over and over again
I keep that in reasons to stay, stay, stay
Skin on my skin
Hands on my face
Feeling your lips all over the place
I thought I knew
But I never felt
Oh, the way you make me melt
Skin on my skin
Hands on my face
Feeling your lips all over the place
I thought I knew
But I never felt
Oh, the way you make me melt
The way you make me melt
The way you make me melt
The way you make me melt
Oh, you make me melt
