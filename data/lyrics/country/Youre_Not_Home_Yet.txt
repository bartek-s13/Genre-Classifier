If you've got two or three minutes well I'd like to tell you a story
It's a story about a preacher
And there's a lotta stories about a lotta preachers
But this story that I wanna tell you is about a protectoral preacher
Who went over seas to fight a war
Now this is a war forgot and not for any country
And he fought a long long time and he won a whole lot of souls
But finally this preacher got old and he was coming home
He just happened to be on the same ship with someone
Whom we call a famous celebry
When the boat docked there were thousands there to meet the celebrity
And they carried him off of his shoulders
But you there wasn't no one there to meet the preacher
And he looked into the heavens and said Lord did you forget me
And it seemed like the heavens broke open
And he said no son I didn't forget but you must remember you're not home yet
You're not home you're not home you're not home yet
I can still hear my Lord's voice ringing
There'll be a crowd to greet you a choir of angels to meet you
I didn't forget but son you're not home yet
I didn't forget but son you're not home yet
