Are you ready to kick it up?
Come on
Tonight it's gonna take a little bit more
Than the average throw it down
It's been one of those, one-of-those weeks
I'd rather forget about
Get a plastic sheet for the bed of your truck
Fill it full of beer and ice
Call your boss, your wife and lazy husbands
Cause no-one's goin' home tonight
We gotta raise the bar, take it off in my car
A whole new level of breakin' it loose
So kick it up another notch
This party ain't for shrinkin' violets
Give it all you got
Oooo Oooo
Pass me the scotch
Let's kick this mother up another notch
Now whoever passess out here first
Gets tied up to a tree
And if you jump out in the water
You got to be naked as a breeze
Out in the field there's a beat up car
Let's set that heap on fire
We stay out here till the sune comes up
If we have to go a bit haywire
We gotta elevate whatever it takes
To a whole new level of breakin' loose
So kick it up another notch
This party ain't for shrinkin' violets
Give it all you got
Oooo Oooo
Pour me a shot
Let's kick this mother up another notch
Oh we gotta raise the bar, take it off in my car
A whole new level of breakin' it loose, break it loose
Let's kick this mother up another notch
Pass me the scotch
Let's kick this mother up another notch
Call your friends and their cute brothers
Kick this mother up another notch
