Well I've woke up in places that I couldn't remember
Who's lying next to me or even how I got there
That's hard to believe but that's how I used to roll
One Tuesday night in an underground pool hall
That's where I saw her for the first time
Right around last call
She stole my heart and I started walking down a new road

And when I'm holdin' her
It's like peace on Earth
Where time stands still
Love's the only thing, yeah, that I feel
When she's in my arms
No matter where we are
Well I am right at home when I'm holdin' her

On a park bench down on 4th Street
That's where I popped the question
And to my amazement she actually said yes
And tears filled my eyes as I slipped that ring on her hand
And then a few short years later God put into my world
A 6 pound and 8 ounce sweet baby girl
And ever since that day let me tell you know
I became a brand new man... because
When I'm holdin' her
It's like peace on Earth
Where time stands still
Love's the only thing, yeah, that I feel
When she's in my arms
No matter where we are
Well I am right at home when I'm holdin' her

I am right at home
When I'm holdin' her
