No more racking my brain
Wondering what I did wrong
No more hoping you'll call
Over stressing and checking my phone now

No more feeling sorry for myself
Al history books are on the shelf
What's done is done
There's nothing else to say

If you wanna go out and take me on the dance floor
Spin me around and tell me that you want more
Well, I ain't having this conversation
No more Friday night lipstick wasted
All of my time drink, drinking your Kool-Aid
Spending my dimes and my kisses on you, babe
If you're thinking that I'm on the fence
Thinking I want you back, nah
Baby, I'm good
Baby, I'm good

Well, baby, I'm good at calling bull, turns out you're full of it
I guess my mama was right, I just dodged a bullet
So what? You bought a brand new truck
And now you wanna pick me up
Well, honey I don't give a-
A care about you

If you wanna go out and take me on the dance floor
Spin me around and tell me that you want more
Well, I ain't having this conversation
No more Friday night lipstick wasted
All of my time drink, drinking your Kool-Aid
Spending my dimes and my kisses on you, babe
If you're thinking that I'm on the fence
Thinking I want you back, nah
Baby, I'm good, ay
Baby, I'm good

Baby, I'm good, baby, I'm good, yeah
You know what, baby? I'm good
Goodbye, goodbye
I'm only wishing you would just have a nice life
You know what, baby? I'm good
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, ay

So if you wanna go out and take me on the dance floor
Spin me around and tell me that you want more
I ain't having this conversation
No more Friday night lipstick wasted
All of my time drink, drinking your Kool-Aid
Spending my dimes and my kisses on you, babe
If you're thinking that I'm on the fence
Thinking I want you back, nah
Baby, I'm good, ay
Baby, I'm good, ooo
Baby, I'm good, yeah
So good
