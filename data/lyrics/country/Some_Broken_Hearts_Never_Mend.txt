Coffee black, cigarettes
Start this day, like all the rest
First thing every morning that I do
Is start missing you
Some broken hearts never mend
Some memories never end
Some tears will never dry
My love for you will never die
Rendezvous in the night
A willing woman to hold me tight
But in the middle of love's embrace
I see your face
Some broken hearts never mend
Some memories never end
Some tears will never dry
My love for you will never die
