Stoppin' in the middle of the street
Grabbin' my arm, leanin' in on me
We should be running for cover
But we were holding each other
Fallin' from the sky to the ground
Yeah, the rain made a beautiful sound
But our heartbeats were so loud
They drowned everything else out

I can't forget they way you were kissin' my lips
The way you felt on my skin, no
Yeah, that young love
It'll mess ya up
The first time you try to chase
But nothing can replace

That young love
Stuck in that young love
Just falling to get over
Trying to recover from
That young love
Stuck in that young love
It's the first time that lasts
The one that you want back
But you can't have it back, can't re-do
Can't erase the past
It's a part of who you are
All grown up with a broken heart
Those streetlights turn to stars
In the middle of the city with you in my arms
Everybody thought we were crazy
But we weren't looking for safety
We were young and naive
Thought we knew everything
But we didn't know anything at all

'Cause in that moment
I could feel my heart stop (man)
I never felt so alive

That young love
Stuck in that young love
Just falling to get over
Trying to recover from
That young love
Stuck in that young love
It's the first time that lasts
The one that you want back
But you can't have it back, can't re-do
Can't erase the past
It's a part of who you are
All grown up with a broken heart
Mmm
If young love isn't real love
Then why does it hurt so bad?
No
I said if young love isn't real love
Then why does it hurt so bad?
No

That young love
Stuck in that young love
Oh, falling to get over
Trying to recover from
That young love
Stuck in that young love
It's the first time that lasts
The one that you want back
But you can't have it back, can't re-do
Can't erase the past
It's all part of who you are
We're all grown up with a broken heart
(If young love isn't real love
Then why does it hurt so bad?)
With a broken heart
We're all part of that young love
(If young love isn't real love
Then why does it hurt so bad?)
No
We're all part of that young love
We're caught up in that young love
