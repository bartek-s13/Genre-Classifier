Some men spend a lifetime
Trying to somehow leave their mark
Waiting and waiting
A grand inspiration to spark
To leave behind something remembered
Something everyone has heard of
Some people build it
Some people paint it
And some people do it with love

Shakespeare sure knew how to write down
Words that will live throughout time
And that Eiffel Tower's still standing
Was built to be one of a kind
Da Vinci's got his Mona Lisa
And Beethoven's got his symphonies
But you're my masterpiece

Every love story ending
Is just fairytales until us
Yeah, 'cause this kind of story
No one could ever make up
It started the day that I met you
And this fire won't ever burn out
And I know when we die
What we leave behind
They'll always talk about
Shakespeare sure knew how to write down
Words that will live throughout time
And that Eiffel Tower's still standing
Was built to be one of a kind
Da Vinci's got his Mona Lisa
And Beethoven's got his symphonies
But you're my masterpiece
Masterpiece

Shakespeare sure knew how to write down
Words that will live throughout time
And that Eiffel Tower's still standing
Was built to be one of a kind
Da Vinci's got his Mona Lisa
And Beethoven's got his symphonies
But you're my masterpiece
Yeah you're my masterpiece
