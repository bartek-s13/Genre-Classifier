You try so hard to be a mystery, a lady never shows her cards. The words you speak say you love me, but the tone of your voice says it's hard. Love me to pieces, you left me speechless. I'm fighting fair, but baby I know your weakness
So let's go to Memphis on the river at that special place we know. You can wear your emerald dress that makes your red hair glow. We'll drink whiskey mixed with moonlight like the water's steady flow. Memphis on the river, that's where I wanna go
I don't pretend to have the answers, as if the questions weren't enough. But let's just say the more you share, beggin me to call your bluff. It's just six oclock, baby don't you stop. Leave Nashville now, and I'll leave Little Rock
We'll go to Memphis on the river at that special place we know. You can wear your emerald dress that makes your red hair glow. We'll drink whiskey mixed with moonlight like the water's steady flow. Memphis on the river, that's where I wanna go
Lovin soothes our hearts, like slow heat in the dark. With an old song playing, that echoes just what I'm saying, babe
Memphis on the river at that special place we know. You can wear your emerald dress that makes your red hair glow. We'll drink whiskey mixed with moonlight like the water's steady flow. Memphis on the river, that's where I wanna go
We're goin to Memphis on the river. Go to Memphis on the river, child. Memphis on the river, baby, river, baby. Come on let's go, it won't take long
Meet me down in Memphis
