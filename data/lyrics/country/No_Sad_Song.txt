She’s a little heart breaker
A no give and all taker
The funny thing is, she don’t even know it
You can’t blame her
 
She don’t know about lonely
She don’t wanna a one and only
She’ll get a little wild, have a good time
But no strings
 
She don’t know no sad song
As soon as she hits that neon she’s all
Tearin' it up to an up beat track
That girl ain’t down with that
Slow hand, slow dance, no that ain’t her jam
She’s a rock all night long
She don’t know no sad song
 
Give her some of that tempo
She’ll be letting them hips go
Hands in the air like she just don’t care
Next thing you know
 
She’s with the girls, up on top of the bar, she’s got the boys, all falling hard
I can’t lie, it’s kinda beautiful
 
She don’t know no sad song
As soon as she hits that neon she’s all
Tearin' it up to an up beat track
That girl ain’t down with that
Slow hand, slow dance, no that ain’t her jam
She’s a rock all night long
She don’t know no sad song
She don’t know no sad song
She don’t know no sad song
As soon as she hits that neon she’s all
Tearin' it up to an up beat track
That girl ain’t down with that
Slow hand, slow dance, no that ain’t her jam
She’s a rock all night long
She don’t know no sad song
She don’t know no sad song
She don’t know no sad song
