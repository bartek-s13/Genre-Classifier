Tell me a lie
Say I look familiar
Though I know that you don't even know my name
Tell me a lie
Say ya just got into town
Even though I've seen you here before
Just hangin' around
Umm, tell me a lie
Say you're not a married man
'Cause you don't know I saw you
Slip off your wedding band
Ooh, tell me a lie
Say ya got no place to stay
But you'll be glad to drive me home
'Cause it's on your way
Tell me a lie
When you take me home
(Tell me a lie)
I don't really want to spend the night alone
Tell me a lie
Don't worry about my sorrow
You'll be long gone tomorrow
And you won't have to see me cry
Just tell me a lie
Tell me a lie
Come on, tell me that you need me
And I'll pretend that it's for real
The way you want me to
Please, tell me a lie
When you're lying close beside me
And whisper when you hold me
Sweet words 'I love you'
Ooh, tell me a lie
When our night is almost over
And make it easy on us both
When it's time for you to go
Come on, tell me a lie
Say you'd really like to stay
Just tell me one more lie
That you'll be back one day
Tell me a lie
When you take me home
(Tell me a lie)
I don't really want to spend the night alone
Tell me a lie
Don't worry about my sorrow
You'll be long gone tomorrow
And you won't have to see me cry
Just tell me a lie
