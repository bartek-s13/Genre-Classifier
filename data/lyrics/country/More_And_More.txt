More and more I'm forgetting the past, more and more I'm living at last
Day by day I'm losin' my blues, more and more I'm forgettin' bout you
But oh how hard I'd tried to keep you by my side
And oh how I cried the day you said goodbye
Day by day I'm losin' my blues, more and more I'm forgettin' bout you
( fiddle - steel )
But oh how hard I'd tried to keep you by my side
And oh how I cried the day you said goodbye
Day by day I'm losin' my blues, more and more I'm forgettin' bout you
