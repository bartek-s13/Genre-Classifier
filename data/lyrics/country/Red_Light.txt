So this is how it ends
This is where it all goes down
This is what "I don't love you" feels like
It ain't the middle of the night
And it ain't even raining outside
It ain't exactly what I had in mind, for goodbye

At a red light in the sunshine on a Sunday
Nothing to say, don't even try
Some are coming home, some are leaving town
While my world's crashing down
On a Sunday in the sunshine
At a red light

I thought she was gonna say
Something 'bout that couple kids and crossing the street
Or something about this beautiful day
But she just looked me in the eye
Said "it's over", didn't try to lie or pick a fight
I might have seen it coming that way

But at a red light in the sunshine on a Sunday
Nothing to say, don't even try
Some are coming home, some are leaving town
While my world's crashing down
On a Sunday in the sunshine
At a red light
There's a mama calming down a little baby
In the backseat in front of me
There's an old man dressed in his Sunday best
Just waiting on green
But I can't see getting past

This red light in the sunshine on a Sunday
Nothing to say, don't even try
Some are coming home, some are leaving town
While my world's crashing down
On a Sunday in the sunshine

At a red light in the sunshine on a Sunday
Nothing to say, don't even try
Some are coming home, some are leaving town
While my world's crashing down
On a Sunday in the sunshine

At a red light
At a red light
At a red light
At a red light
