I was waiting on my chariot to steal me away
Wishing on stars and fairy dust and running low on faith
Yeah, the way that I saw it, my true love would come calling
Tossing pebbles at the window of my ivory tower
I was looking for roses, oh, but how would I know that
Love's a little closer to a wildflower?

I'd been waiting on a white horse (Oh, oh)
To take me away on a sunset ride
But you showed up on a dark horse (Oh, oh)
At the Cinderella midnight, just in time
Maybe not the way I was dreaming of
But you rode in and won my love
And now I'm finally on the right course (Oh, oh)
Who needs a white horse?

Woah-oh, woah
Woah-oh, woah

I like the way you came out of the blue
And took me by surprise
You make me feel like I'm a mystery to you
And not some kind of prize

I'd been waiting on a white horse (Oh, oh)
To take me away on a sunset ride
But you showed up on a dark horse (Oh, oh)
At the Cinderella midnight, just in time
Maybe not the way I was dreaming of
But you rode in and won my love
And now I'm finally on the right course (Oh, oh)
Yeah, who needs a white horse?

Woah-oh, woah
(Woah-oh, oh)
Woah-oh, woah, oh yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah (Woah-oh, oh)

Oh, the way that I saw it, my true love would come calling
Tossing pebbles at the window of my ivory tower
I was looking for roses, oh, but how would I know that
Love's a little closer to a wildflower?
To a wildflower

I'd been waiting on a white horse
Oh, to take me away on a sunset ride
But you showed up on a dark horse
At the Cinderella midnight, just in time
Maybe not the way I was dreaming of
But you rode in and won my love
And now I'm finally on the right course (Oh, oh)
Yeah, who needs a white horse?

Hey, hey yeah, yeah
Mm-mm, oh
Woah-oh, woah, oh, oh
(Woah-oh, oh)
