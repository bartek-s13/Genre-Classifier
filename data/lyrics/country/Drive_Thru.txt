2 AM
Street lights are out and bars are closing
You still come over, yeah, your hoping, I'm open
'Cause you feel like something sweet (Mm, mm)
Quick fix
You always want me at your fingertips
You think you got yourself a membership for these lips
Any day of the week

I've said it before and I'll say it again

Boy, I ain't your drive-thru
You can't roll up whenever you like
There's no late night menu
Whenever you got an appetite
You always show up at my window
Trying to order this but you know
Boy, I ain't your drive-thru
So keep driving thru
Keep driving thru

Pick up line
You think if you're a regular, you'll get a prize
But all I'm serving up are goodbyes, supersize
And that's a special for you

I've said it before and I'll say it again

Boy, I ain't your drive-thru
You can't roll up whenever you like
There's no late night menu
Whenever you got an appetite
You always show up at my window
Trying to order this but you know
Boy, I ain't your drive-thru
So keep driving thru (I'm sorry we're closed)
Keep driving thru (Come again, never)

I've said it before and I'll say it again

Boy, I ain't your drive-thru
You can't roll up whenever you like
There's no late night menu
Whenever you got an appetite
You always show up at my window
Trying to order this but you know
Boy, I ain't your drive-thru (Boy I ain't your drive-thru)
So keep driving thru
Boy, I ain't your drive-thru
You can't roll up whenever you like
There's no late night menu
Whenever you got an appetite
You always show up at my window
Trying to order this but you know
Boy, I ain't your drive-thru
So keep driving thru
