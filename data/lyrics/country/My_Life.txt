My eyes are brown
I spent my whole life lookin' down
Dodgin' punches, bounced around
Telling myself I wasn't no count
I'm starting to see things different now
Out of nowhere you showed up
Said you liked my edges rough
Felt your touch and for the first time
I didn't wanna buck

I love my eyes 'cause you look into 'em
And I love my name 'cause you say it, baby
I love my heart 'cause you stole it
My kiss 'cause you want it
My mind 'cause you're on it every minute
I love my life 'cause you're in it

A vagabond just runnin' from my blood
Keeping my back to the sun
Whiskey on my breath, bitter words on my tongue
Showed you the truth, you kissed my scars
And the faded faces on my cards
I ain't the man I used to be
Because of who you are
I love my eyes 'cause you look into 'em
And I love my name 'cause you say it, baby
I love my heart 'cause you stole it
My kiss 'cause you want it
My mind 'cause you're on it every minute
I love my life 'cause you're in it

It's just the beginning of
A beautiful ending love
Your love makes life worth living, worth living

I love my eyes 'cause you look into 'em
And I love my name 'cause you say it, baby
I love my heart 'cause you stole it
My kiss 'cause you want it
My mind 'cause you're on it every minute
I love my life 'cause you're in it
I love my life 'cause you're in it
Oh
