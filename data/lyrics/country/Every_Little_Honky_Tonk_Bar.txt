Whiskey is the gasoline that lights the fire that burns the bridge
Ice creates the water that's no longer runnin' under it
Stool holds the fool that pours the whiskey on his broken heart
Cigarettes create the smoke that hides the lonesome in his eyes
The jukebox plays Hank, "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"
Dance floor holds the folks trying to forget who they are
And that's what happens in every little honky tonk bar

Friday night, it's a given
I'll be L-I-V-N, livin'
We'll dance on the bar 'til we're sleeping it off in the car
Monday morning, it's a given
I'll be D-R-A-G-N, draggin'
And that's what happens in every little honky tonk bar

Neon lights flashing bright 'til you're almost hypnotized
Waitress, short skirt, gets hit on by every guy
Comin' and goin', always rollin' with the flow
Bartender, pour our drinks; Código, do a shot
You think you're tall and bulletproof
Until somebody says you're not
You step outside thinkin' you're gonna show 'em you are
And that's what happens in every little honky tonk bar

Friday night, it's a given
We'll be L-I-V-N, livin'
We'll dance on the bar 'til we're sleeping it off in the car
Monday morning, it's a given
We'll be D-R-A-G-N, draggin'
And that's what happens in every little honky tonk bar
Yeah, that's what happens in every little honky tonk bar

Whiskey is the gasoline that lights the fire that burns the bridge
