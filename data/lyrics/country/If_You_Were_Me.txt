If you were me and I were you and I should do the things you do
Would you still love the way I keep on loving you
Of all the times you've been untrue if I should be the same by you
Just tell me now what would you do if you were me and I were you
( fiddle - steel )
Someday my love may grow cold then I'll love you no more I know
Think of all the unkind things you said and done
But I still love you even though your love for me you'll never show
Just tell me now what would you do if you were me and I were you
If you were me and I were you...
