Come over here and sit beside me
And tell me about your day
Suns goin down outside our window
But honey, that's okay
There was a time when the night seemed so lonely
But I know it never will again
Cause the love of my life, is my best friend
Had our ups and downs before we were together
The road of life ain't always smooth
But for you and me it stretches on forever
I know our love will see us through
There was a time this old world seemed so lonely
But I know it never will again
Cause the love of my life, is my best friend
Every night as I lay down beside you
I feel blessed to know that I..
Will have the love of my best friend
For the rest of my life
There was a time this old world seemed so lonely
But I know it never will again
Cause the love of my life, is my best friend
