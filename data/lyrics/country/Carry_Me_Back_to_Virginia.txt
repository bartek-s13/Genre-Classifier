Well, I come from the valley, I'm a rebel boy
Born on the banks of the Shenandoah
In '61, I went to the war
To win one for Virginia!
Yeah, my brother went first and they called me too
I was green as clover in the morning dew
So I marched to the drum and I sang to the tune
Carry me back to Virginia!

Fire in the cannon, water in the well
Raced through the valley with a rebel yell
I learned right quick how to march like hell
And affix that bayonet

Won't ya carry me back?
Won't ya carry me back?
Carry me back to Virginia

With a sword and a saddle
Powder in the gun
We thought for a minute our fight was done
So they lined us up with our medals on
And hammered us into the quicksand
Then they burned that valley in a blaze of fire
Cut through the lands like a red hot iron
Til the men took cover where the horses piled
Then we shivered in the cold against them

But the war raged on like flames of hell
We dug through the pockets of the ones who fell
Dressed in rags and we ate like rats
When they cut off our legs we cried!

Won't ya carry me back?
Won't ya carry me back?
Carry me back to Virginia
Won't ya carry me back?
Won't ya carry me back?
Carry me back to Virginia

And they died in the valley
Died in the swamp
On the banks of the river where the whitetail jumped
Died in the ditches
Died in the fields
In the belly of a wagon a‘fore our wounds were healed
Died in the war
Starved in the camps
Locked in the prisons of a meaner man
Spilled our blood in the fight to defend
And they buried us all over Dixieland

Down in Alabama
Down in Caroline
Way down in Georgia, on the Tennessee line
We fought for the rebels, and Robert E. Lee
Now we want to go home to Virginia
Say we want to go home to Virginia!

Won't ya carry me back?
Won't ya carry me back?
Carry me back to Virginia
Won't ya carry me back?
Won't ya carry me back?
I wanna be buried in Virginia
