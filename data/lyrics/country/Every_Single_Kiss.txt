Beat up truck, I hammer it down
Complain too much, but it gets me around
I call you up, you like the sound
Yeah what do ya say, we burn it down?
Strawberry wine runnin' off your lips
Fallin' in love with every single kiss
Every single kiss

We're dancin' and sippin' on the bottle
We can hit the night full throttle
We can take a ride to the lake
Never make a mistake, It's never too late
There's not a chance I'd miss this
Whoa yeah we'll end the night with every single kiss

Fallin' down or fallin' in love
Whatever it is, I can't get enough
There's no words that can explain
The feelin' I get when I hear your name
I hear your name

We're dancin' and sippin' on the bottle
We can hit the night full throttle
We can take a ride to the lake
Never make a mistake, It's never too late
There's not a chance I'd miss this
Whoa yeah we'll end the night with every single kiss
Baby done hesitate
Regrets are the chances you don't take
That you don't take

Dancin' and sippin' on the bottle
We can hit the night full throttle
We can take a ride to the lake
Never make a mistake, It's never too late
There's not a chance I'd miss this
Whoa yeah we'll end the night with every single kiss
[Outro[
Ohh yeah
We'll end the night with
Every single kiss
