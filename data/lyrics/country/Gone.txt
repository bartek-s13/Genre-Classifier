(Wish I could stay but you’re gone)
(Wish I could stay but you’re gone)
I heard you moved from our little town
And I’m gonna miss seeing you around
I’m haunted by the memories left here in this place
Everywhere that I go I can swear I still see your face
What if I called you and I told you everything?
What if you knew that it was driving me insane?
I’m at the point where I’d do damn near anything
To keep you home
And you’re still gone
Still Gone
My friends they try to never mention your name
I still think about it every drink I take
But I may never drink me enough to ever kill the pain
So I sit here night after night and do it over again
What if I called you and I told you everything?
What if you knew that it was driving me insane?
I’m at the point where I’d do damn near anything
To keep you home
Don’t want to know if there's somebody next to you
Holding you the way that I was meant to do
Been trying to find a way that I can cut you loose
But I keep holding on
And you’re still gone
You’re still Gone
You’re Still Gone (you’re still gone)
You’re Still Gone
What if I called you and I told you everything?
What if you knew that it was driving me insane?
I’m at the point where I’d do damn near anything
To keep you home
Don’t want to know if there's somebody next to you
Holding you the way that I was meant to do
Been trying to find a way that I can cut you loose
But I keep holding on
And you’re still gone.  (gone gone)
You’re still Gone. (gone gone)
You’re Still Gone
You’re Still Gone
(Wish I could stay but you’re gone)
