Where'd you learn to talk like that
It's the sweetest thing I've ever heard
You stop me in my tracks
You got me hangin' onto every word
When I ask you your name, coulda heard you say it a thousand times
The way it rolled off your lips
You had to be from somewhere like
Lousiana, Mississippi
The Coast of Georgia, the Heart of Dixie
Wherever it is, girl it's gets me
Drunk on you like a fifth of whiskey
My heart beats fast when you talk slow
Slower than a sunset in Tupelo
And if you're sayin' anything at all
I'll stand right here and fall
For your southern drawl
I can talk to you all night
Somethin' about you feels like home
Even if you said goodbye
You'd make it sound good, but I hope you don't
'Cause I wanna get to know you
Take me down every road that brought you to me, yeah
Come on get a little closer
I wanna know everything, everything
Are you from Louisiana, Mississippi
The coast of Georgia, the Heart of Dixie
Wherever it is, girl it gets me
Drunk on you like a fifth of whiskey
My heart beats fast when you talk slow
Slower than a sunset in Tupelo
And if you're sayin' anything at all
I'll stand right here and fall
For your southern drawl
Southern drawl
What makes you run, what makes you wild
Your voice sounds like a million miles
A million miles
Louisiana, Mississippi
The coast of Georgia, the Heart of Dixie
Wherever it is, girl it gets me
Drunk on you like a fifth of whiskey
My heart beats fast when you talk slow
Slower than a sunset in Tupelo
And if you're sayin' anything at all
I'll stand right here and fall
For your southern drawl
Southern drawl
