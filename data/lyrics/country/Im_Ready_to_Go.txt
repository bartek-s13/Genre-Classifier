Hallelujah, I'm ready
I can hear the voices singing soft and low
Hallelujah, I'm ready
Hallelujah, I'm ready to go
In the darkness of night not a star was in sight
On a highway that leads down below
Then Jesus came in and saved my soul from sin
Hallelujah, I'm ready to go
Hallelujah, I'm ready
I can hear the voices singing soft and low
Hallelujah, I'm ready
Hallelujah, I'm ready to go
Sinners don't wait before it's too late
He's a wonderful Saviour you know
Well I fell on my knees when I answered my pleas
Hallelujah, I'm ready to go
Hallelujah, I'm ready
I can hear the voices singing soft and low
Hallelujah, I'm ready
Hallelujah, I'm ready to go
Hallelujah, I'm ready
I can hear the voices singing soft and low
Hallelujah, I'm ready
Hallelujah, I'm ready to go
Hallelujah, I'm ready
I can hear the voices singing soft and low
Hallelujah, I'm ready
Hallelujah, I'm ready to go
