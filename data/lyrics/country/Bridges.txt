I ain't perfect
No I never claimed to be
And I'm still workin' on a better side of me
Sometimes I drink too much
Sometimes I smoke and cuss
I work hard to play hard hell like everybody does

But I took the long way every lesson I learned
And I gotta scar to show for every stripe that I've earned
But looking back can't help but laugh at all the pages I've turned
No worries it's just water under the bridges I've burned

Yeah I've been real close I've even said those three words
And everybody knows when you take it back it hurts
Every little white lie, every bullshit fight
It started the fire when the flames got higher
Just stew up two and smoke the tires

But I took the long way every lesson I learned
And I gotta scar to show for every stripe that I've earned
But looking back can't help but laugh at all the pages I've turned
No worries it's just water under the bridges I've burned
But I took the long way every lesson I learned
And I gotta scar to show for every stripe that I've earned
But looking back can't help but laugh at all the pages I've turned
No worries it's just water under the bridges I've burned
It's just water under the bridges I've burned
