Check me a bag gotta get it
I get it then flip it
I make it two times then i up on them digits
They hatin they stuck and I’m standing like bridges
Let’s get it, let’s get it, let’s get it, let’s get it
Bitch try to moan and she soundin like british
They call me lil rabbit, i race to the finish
Boy you not a dog you a cat you a kitten
I’m tryna get money for real i ain’t kiddin
You clippin they rippin I’m runnin you trippin i shoot scottie pippen
My taper be inchin my finger be itchin you pimpin a ride that ain’t yours boy you simple
Holes in yo face like a dimple, dots on your face like a pimple
This is the wave you be startin a ripple
This my time don’t hoe, don’t tickle
2018 countin green like a pickle
Bitch on my dick call her Jill no riddle
Whip it out, screamin now, bitch it ain’t little
2018 countin green like a pickle
