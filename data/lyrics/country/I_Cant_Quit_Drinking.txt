They could quit making whiskey
They could stop stomping grapes
If it wasn't for fools like me
With hearts that break
They could close all the breweries
And they can lock up the bars
If it wasn't for women like you
Who leaves loving scars

And I can't quit drinking
Lord knows I've tried
I'm gonna wear this whiskey glass stare
Till my memories go blind
Now I can't quit drinking
And it will kill me they say
And if Heaven's sweet shores
Have swinging doors
I'll find them someday

You know I thought it all over
And I still don't understand
With millions of women
How could one mean so much to a man
A woman and whiskey
They're so much alike
'Cause just when you need 'em the most
You're left high and dry

And I can't quit drinking
Lord knows I've tried
So, I'm gonna wear this whiskey glass stare
Till my memories go blind
'Cause I can't quit drinking
And it'll kill me they say
And if Heaven's sweet shores
Have swinging doors
I'll find them someday
Yes, if Heaven's sweet shores
Have swinging doors
I'll find them someday
