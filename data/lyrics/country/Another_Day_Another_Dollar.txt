Another day another dollar daylight comes I'm on my way
Another day another dollar workin' my whole life away
The boss told me I'd get paid weakly and that's exactly how I'm paid
Another day another dollar workin' my whole life away
Another day another dollar...
My family is my thanksgiving I love 'em more each day
And they're the reason I keep living and working my whole life away
Another day another dollar...
