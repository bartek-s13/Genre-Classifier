Well I met in a small town bar not far from home
She was having second thoughts about a man who was always gone
Said the only way to get to him was a telephone
So she held on to me when she couldn't hld her own
She said I can be had but I can't be bought
And I can be bad lord if I don't get caught
But I'd rather be loved than left alone
Than be here in the middle some where between right and wrong
She said you know I never was the kind to spread it around
But I'll let you get to me as long as you don't let me down
Said I got the kind of love it takes to make if feel slow
But don't care how you get me there just long as I go
She said I can be had but I can't be bought
And I can be bad lord if I don't get caught
But I'd rather be loved than left alone
Than be here in the middle some where between right and wrong
Ya its her kind of love keeps me coming back time after time
Just like a beautiful song I can't get off my mind
But I worry alot about love you have to wait on
And I got second thoughts about a woman who is always gone
She said I can be had but I can't be bought
And I can be bad lord if I don't get caught
But I'd rather be loved than left alone
Than be here in the middle some where between right and wrong
