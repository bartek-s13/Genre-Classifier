She stood before God, her family and friends
And vowed that she'd never love anyone else again
Only me
As pure as her gown of white she stood by my side
And promised that she'd love me till the day she died
Lord, please forgive her even though she lied
'Cause you're the only one who knows just how hard she tried
She had a ring on her finger and time on her hands
The woman in her needed the warmth of a man
The gold turned cold in her wedding band
It's just a ring on your finger
When there's time on your hands
When I add up all the countless nights she cried herself to sleep
And all the broken promises I somehow failed to keep
I can't blame her
I'm the one who left her too many times alone
In a three bedroom prison she tried to make a home
Her love slowly died but the fire inside still burned
In the arms of a stranger was the only place left to turn
She had a ring on her finger and time on her hands
The woman in her needed the warmth of a man
The gold turned cold in her wedding band
It's just a ring on your finger
When there's time....
She had a ring on her finger and time on her hands
The woman in her needed the warmth of a man
The gold turned cold in her wedding band
It's just a ring on your finger
When there's time on your hands
