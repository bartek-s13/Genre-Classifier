Girl I was down when you found me right down on my knees
Some woman had chewed me up and spit me out did me like she pleased
Then I looked up and saw you coming and when I felt your warm hand touching mine
Out of a cold grey lonely sky I saw your love light shine
Proud of you baby you took my heart in the palm of your hand
And you saved me
Proud of you baby gonna thank you for the rest of my life
For what you gave me
Proud of you baby she brought me down right to the ground
But you found me
And put your arms around me
Oh it's warm there I feel at home there
Proud of you baby every evening when the sun goes down
You know I'll be there
Proud of you baby reach out your hand and touch your man
You'll find me there
Proud of you baby there's a chain of love wrapped around us
Now we can't break it
Proud of you baby sharing and caring living and giving we're gonna make it
Proud of you baby
