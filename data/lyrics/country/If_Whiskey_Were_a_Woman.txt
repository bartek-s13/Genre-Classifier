If whiskey were a woman
She'd do her best to get you drunk
Lie quietly beside you
Watch you sleep

If weed were a woman
She'd fill up both your lungs
Get you higher than you thought
You could ever be
If whiskey were a woman

If a prayer was a woman
She would wait patiently
In your throat
Until you found the strength to speak

If a sunrise was a woman
She would surround you with salvation
Get you standing
Right up off your knees

If whiskey were a woman
She'd be nothing like me
Cause I have given in
I have given up
You wanna love something that I could never be
So take me off the shelf
Take me right out of your arms
And pour yourself a glass of whiskey

If the cure was a woman
She would get under your skin
And take all of your troubles away
She would remind you who you were
Before all the pain set in
When you promised her
Your love would never fade

If whiskey were a woman
She'd be nothing like me

Cause I have given in
I have given up
You wanna love something that I could never be
So take me off the shelf
Take me right out of your arms
And pour yourself a glass of whiskey
If whiskey were a woman
She'd be nothing like me
If whiskey were a woman
She'd be nothing like me
