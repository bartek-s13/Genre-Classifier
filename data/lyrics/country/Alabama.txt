She picked up the telephone
All she heard was dial tone
She really thought she heard it ring this time
She said what am I thinking I must be only dreaming
Or maybe it's the hundred times he's crossed my mind
Just tonight
She said maybe I miss your loving
Maybe I miss your kiss, just a little bit
Maybe I miss your body, lying right next to mine
Maybe I miss your touch, a little too much
Tossing and turning her skin's still burning
From the fire in his hands
Running on empty, she needs somebody
But somebody wouldn't understand
Then the telephone rings
She said maybe I miss your loving
Maybe I miss your kiss, just a little bit
Maybe I miss your body, lying right next to mine
Maybe I miss your touch, a little too much
They talked about Savannah
Sweet home Alabama
And how he missed the way she always smiled
"Are you coming back soon"
"By the Harvest moon
If I have to walk every mile on my knees"
She said maybe I miss your loving
Maybe I miss your kiss, just a little bit
Maybe I miss your body, lying right next to mine
Maybe I miss your touch, a little too much
She said maybe I miss your loving
Maybe I miss your kiss, just a little bit
Maybe I miss your body, lying right next to mine
Maybe I miss your touch, a little too much
