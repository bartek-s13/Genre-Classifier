Love me in the morning
Love me like you need me
I hear you call and your never gonna leave me
Loving you is easy
Never gonna say goodbye
Love me in the evening
Hold me till i'm sleeping
I know your with me
I hear you breathin'
Yeah I'm gonna love
Yeah I'm gonna love you right
Rainfalls louder, snow falls down
Colours brighter when you're around
Cause there's no shotgun hanging around my door tonight
With you I'm safe here till' the morning light
Love me in the morning
Love me like you need me
I hear you call and your never gonna leave me
Loving you is easy
Never gonna say goodbye
Love me in the evening
Hold me till i'm sleeping
I know your with me
I hear you breathin'
Yeah I'm gonna love
Yeah I'm gonna love you right
Whispers softly, take my hand
Hold me closer, right till the end
Cause there's no shotgun hanging around my door tonight
With you i'm safe here till the morning light
