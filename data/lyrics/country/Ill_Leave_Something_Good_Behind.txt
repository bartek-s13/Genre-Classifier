Well at times it's been a fight
But I've tried to do what's right
Even when everything went wrong
I still believed that we would make it
You put your tiny hand in mine
And I look in your trusting eyes
Knowing that love will see us through
But if my life should end tomorrow
I know you'll be the living proof
And, I'll leave something good behind
You sweet child of mine
You've made my life worth living
And when all my earthly days are through
I'll leave here knowing I did what I came to do
And when I say goodbye I know that
I'll leave something good behind
Well at times it's been a fight
But I've tried to do what's right
Even when everything went wrong
I still believed that we would make it
It hasn't always turned out like I planned
But I've done the best I can
To help you someday face the world alone
And after I've been long forgotten
You'll be my leagacy of love
And, I'll leave something good behind
You sweet child of mine
You've made my life worth living
And when all my earthly days are through
I'll leave here knowing I did what I came to do
And when I say goodbye I know that
I'll leave something good behind
Yes, when I say goodbye I know that
I'll leave something good behind
