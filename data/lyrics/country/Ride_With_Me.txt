You can here my engine hummin', comin' rumblin' up the road
And I know when you meet me at the fence line in the sunshine you'll be
Lookin' fine in your bandanna and your blue jeans
Baby, would you ride with me
So climb up in the seat put your bare feet up tap along with the radio
Girl we can go kick around downtown with the top down we can
Follow this county road wherever it leads
Baby, would you ride with me
(Chorus)
Take my hand, say I do
I want to go down this road with you
High and low, thick and thin
Forevers just around the bend
And we'll be right where we want to be, baby, would you ride with me
You know life is a bull when the gate its pulled and you better be holding on tight
Its a roller coaster, flippin' over
It's a sailboat on the tide, on the wide open seas
Baby, would you ride with me
(Chorus)
Take my hand, say I do
I want to go down this road with you
High and low, thick and thin
Forevers just around the bend
And we'll be right where we want to be, baby, would you ride with me
Well I've thinking all day that life is a highway we all travel on
The one that I want to see sittin' in the seat with me when I
Make my dreams come true, its you, its you
And it feels so fine when you..
(Chorus)
Take my hand, say I do
I want to go down this road with you
High and low, thick and thin
Forevers just around the bend
And we'll be right where we want to be, so baby, would you ride with me
Come on and take a ride with me
