I still go back to those early days in Mankato
We were unbreakable, we were unshakeable
I met you on South Street dancin' in the bar
Ended up outside back at my car
You were unforgettable
You were everything that I could ever look for
I was lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely no more

Thank God for the red wine and the moon light
And the time I held your body all night
That fire too damn hot to keep from burnin'
Thank God for the good luck we had it
It's a damn shame that it never lasted
Now that you're gone and I'm alone here hurtin'
Thank God for the bourbon

We can fight harder longer than the best of 'em
But could make it better, so much better than the rest of 'em
So how'd we let it crash and burn too soon?
But I still wouldn't take away the love I made with you

Thank God for the red wine and the moon light
And the time I held your body all night
That fire too damn hot to keep from burnin'
Thank God for the good luck we had it
It's a damn shame that it never lasted
Now that you're gone and I'm alone here hurtin'
Thank God for the bourbon
Oh, thank God for the bourbon

To let me make a toast
What I can't let go
To love that's like a ghost
That'll haunt me forever
And thank God for the bourbon
Yeah, thank God for the bourbon

Thank God for the red wine and the moon light
And the time I held your body all night
That fire too damn hot to keep from burnin'
Thank God for the good luck we had it
It's a damn shame that it never lasted
Now that you're gone and I'm alone here hurtin'
Thank God for the bourbon
Yeah, thank God for the bourbon
Thank God for the bourbon
Thank God for the bourbon
Thank God for the bourbon
