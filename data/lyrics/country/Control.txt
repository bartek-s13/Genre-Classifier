Sitting here thinkin' bout society
Do you wanna hear some irony?
I don't like going out
But I don't wanna stay at home
Laying here thinkin' bout the things I hate
Staring at a screen til my mind goes blank
It's the same every day
When you know you're not in control

In control
In control

Sleeping through the day so I get my rest
Do you wanna know when I'm at my best?
2am in my bed
Watching some Game of Thrones
Running down the street so I don't get fat
Trying not to stress so I won't just crack
But it's hard to relax
When you know you're not in control

In control
In control
In control
In control
I try to get it out my mind
But I think it all the time
I don't wanna be morose
But I guess that's how it goes
I try to live every day
But the fact still doesn't change
It's like you're part of a show
When you're never in control

In control (I try to get it out my mind, but I think it all the time)
In control (I don't wanna be morose, but I guess that's how it goes)
In control (I try to live every day, but the fact still doesn't change)
In control (It's like you're part of a show, when you're never in control)
