It ain't nothing but a chicken wing
Don't worry about a single thing
When your troubles start coming around
Don't you let it all get you down
Don't sweat the small stuff
Life's too short, live it up
Send your worries right down the drain
It ain't nothing but a chicken wing

Knew this old boy one time
Poor fella nearly lost his mind
Carry around such a heavy load
Never ever learned to let it go
Stayed stressed out to the max
He up and had a heart attack
That fool don't wind up dead
He should've listened when his momma said


When life gives you lemons
Better make some lemonade
When those thunderclouds start pouring down
Go dancing in the rain

Just remember these words I say
It ain't nothing but a chicken wing
It ain't nothing but a chicken wing
