All along the road of life I roam
Lookin' for a place to call my home
Not a fancy mansion or a bungalow for me
But everywhere I go, I seem to find
Hangin' on the door, the same old sign
And my heart beats slower when I read on the door "No Vacancy"

No Vacancy, No Vacancy
All along the line, it's the same old sign waitin' for me
No Vacancy, No Vacancy
And my heart beats slower when I read on the door "No Vacancy"

Not so long ago, when the bullets screamed
Many was the happy dream I dreamed
Of a little nest where I could rest when the world was free
Now the mighty war over there is won
Troubles and trials have just begun
Facing that terrible enemy sign, "No Vacancy"

No Vacancy, No Vacancy
All along the line, it's the same old sign waitin' for me
No Vacancy, No Vacancy
And my heart beats slower when I read on the door "No Vacancy"
Brother, if you live a life of ease
Better take a moment on your knees
And thank the Lord above for all His love, then think about me
Livin' in a world of greed and hate
Hopin' every day that the hand of fate
Will remove that sign that's a-hangin' on the door, "No Vacancy."

No Vacancy, No Vacancy
All along the line, it's the same old sign waitin' for me
No Vacancy, No Vacancy
And my heart beats slower when I read on the door "No Vacancy"
