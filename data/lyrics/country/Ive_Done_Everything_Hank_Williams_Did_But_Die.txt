I've done everything Hank Williams did but die
I've had the Lovesick Blues, been So Lonesome I Could Cry
I've stumbled down that Lost Highway and I Saw the light
I've done everything Hank Williams did but die
I loved a woman with a Cold Cold Heart
She left me for another for his Mansion on the Hill
I passed her on the street and my heart fell at her feet
And I cried the night they rang those Wedding Bells
I've heard the Lonesome Whistle blow
And I've seen my share of Pictures From Life's Other Side
I've watched her rock and weep,  cried and try to sleep
I've done everything Hank Williams did but die
One of these days
I know it's gonna come my time
And like old Hank, I know I'll Never Get Out of This World Alive
One of these days
I know it's gonna come my time
And like old Hank, I know I'll Never Get Out of This World Alive
I've been Honky Tonkin' a time or two
Set the Woods on Fire, gone Howlin' at the Moon
Had a Tear in My Beer, and drank my bucket dry
I've done everything Hank Williams did but die
One of these days
I know it's gonna come my time
