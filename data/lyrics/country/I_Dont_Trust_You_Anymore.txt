I don't trust you anymore
Don't shoot me that old lie
Don't tell me that you're still mine
You're saying things like you said before

But I don't trust you anymore

I gave you benefit of doubt
But your love didn't prove out
We've tried so many times before


I love you and I always will
And I can't help the way I feel
I trusted you till I learned the score


We agreed when last we tried
We'd be better satisfied
Between our love they closed the door
Cause I don't trust you anymore
Now here you are back once more
With your foot back in the door
I guess you'll win like you have before
But I don't trust you anymore
I've loved you and I always will
