You were in my arms, you were in my hands
Somehow I let you slip through just like grains of sand
You gave me your whole heart, I only gave you half
Though I guess that I was looking for that greener grass

'Cause you want and you want the things you don't need
And you need and you need the things you don't have
And you have and you have the things you don't want
'Til you lose 'em, 'til you lose 'em
Yeah, you want and you want the things you don't need
And you need and you need the things you don't have
And you have and you have the things you don't want
'Til you lose 'em, 'til you lose 'em

Turns me inside out since you've been gone
Nothing shines as bright as the diamond you never put on
Now I miss your touch and I crave your kiss
And it kills me, but I know that's just the way it is

'Cause you want and you want the things you don't need
And you need and you need the things you don't have
And you have and you have the things you don't want
'Til you lose 'em, 'til you lose 'em
Yeah, you want and you want the things you don't need
And you need and you need the things you don't have
And you have and you have the things you don't want
'Til you lose 'em
I must have lost my mind, I let you go
It took a little time to let it show
Baby, I was blind, but now I know
This isn't what I want, you're the one I want
You're the one I want

'Cause you want and you want the things you don't need
And you need and you need the things you don't have
And you have and you have the things you don't want
'Til you lose 'em, 'til you lose 'em ('Til you lose 'em)
'Til you lose 'em (Oh, 'til you lose 'em)

I must have lost my mind, I let you go
It took a little time to let it show
Baby, I was blind, but now I know
This isn't what I want, you're the one I want
