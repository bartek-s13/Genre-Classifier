He’s asleep, way too deep
Living like no one ever did before
And where he goes, I can’t tell
No one knows
No one knows
He’s got this look in his eyes
Now I don’t know

Hyde
Hyde
Hyde

When he’s done, tucks me in at night
When you’re gone, he’s the one
Tucks me in at night
When you leave, he’s right there
Quench his thirst without a care

Hyde
Hyde
Hyde
It’s not like i remember it
Nothing at all makes him satisfied
Oh, I can't keep him away when it’s cold at night
And he just took my name and he threw it right in to the wall
Know I’m not allowed to know about what he can’t live without
His clouds

What if you understood all the words I’m too afraid to say out loud?
And what it's like living like poison through these veins
He gets this look in his eyes
Now I don't know

Hyde
Hyde
Hyde

When he’s done, tucks me in at night
When you’re gone, he’s the one
Tucks me in at night
When you leave, he’s right there
Quench his thirst without a care
Hyde
Hyde
