I've seen a lot of places
I've been around the world
I've seen some pretty faces
Been with some beautiful girls
After all I've witnessed
One thing still amazes me
Just like a miracle, you have to see to believe

(Cause) God blessed Texas
With His own hand
Brought down angels from the promised land
Gave 'em a place where they could dance
If you wanna see heaven, brother, here's your chance
I've been sent to spread the message
God blessed Texas
First, He let the sun shine
Then He made the waters deep
Then He gave us moonlight
For all the world to see
Well everybody knows that the Lord works in mysterious ways
He took a rest, then on the very next day

Well I've been sent to spread the message
God blessed Texas
Well I've been sent to spread the message
God blessed Texas
