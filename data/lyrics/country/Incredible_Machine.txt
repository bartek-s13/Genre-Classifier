Feels like I'm flying
Wings made of light
Brand new and shining
Like a shot rung out through the night

A heart that beats an incredible machine
Made of blood, and love, and hope, and lust, and steam

Calling
Calling
Calling

Feels like I'm floating
Weightless in flight
Light that's exploding
As a soul and gravity fight



Lifted higher mercury skies above
Calling
Water, fire burning a sight of love
