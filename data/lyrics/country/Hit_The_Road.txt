This town is like a habit I can't break
Same girl same dreams I just can't shake
Then you walk in the door, just what I'm looking for, oh, babe
I gotta get to know ya
Cause every move you make is getting me high
Putting crazy thoughts in my mind
When you shooting that smile over here, yeah, my way
My way, yeah
Girl you've got me thinking about the highway, highway
Whoah, Whoah, Whoah
This town is like an anchor dragging us down
Whoah, Whoah, Whoah, girl
We could get away and start living out loud
Got a hundred dollars and a tank of gas
We could throw a dart at this coffee-stained map
Girl, come on, come on, come on lets go
Baby let's hit the road
Your kiss is like a song that I can't write
Cause there ain't a word for what it feels like
When you shooting that smile over here, yeah, my way
My way
Girl you've got me thinking about the highway, highway
Whoah, Whoah, Whoah
This town is like an anchor dragging us down
Whoah, Whoah, Whoah, girl
We could get away and start living out loud
Got a hundred dollars and a tank of gas
We could throw a dart at this coffee-stained map
Girl, come on, come on, come on, lets go
Baby, let's hit the road
Gonna get away, gonna chase these white lines
Kissing my neck got me loosing my mind
Blowin' right through these buckshot stop signs
Pedal to the floor, leave it all behind us
Whoah, Whoah, Whoah
This town is like an anchor dragging us down
Whoah, Whoah, Whoah, girl
We could get away and start living out loud
Got a hundred dollars and a tank of gas
We could throw a dart at this coffee-stained map
Girl, come on, come on, come on, lets go
Baby, let's hit the road
Whoah, Whoah, Whoah
Baby, lets hit the road
Whoah, Whoah, Whoah
Baby, lets hit the road
Whoah, Whoah, Whoah
Baby, lets hit the road
Whoah, Whoah, Whoah
Lets hit the road
