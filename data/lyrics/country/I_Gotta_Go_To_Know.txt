I know that the sun will rise tomorrow
And all my worry it don't change a thing
Just tryin'a find more happiness than sorrow
And i'm yet to know just what each day will bring
I'm gonna go down that highway find out my way
Cross every river down every byway
Laugh and live and love and fall
Yeah i wanna do it all
It's a mystery but i'm gonna see
Something bigger yeah bigger than me
If i wanna find what's waiting down that road
I gotta go to know
It's easy to just stay here in the small town
A long way from the fire and not get burnt
But i wanna touch that flame before it goes out
Don't wanna stand in line and wait my turn
I'm gonna go down that highway find out my way
Cross every river down every byway
Laugh and live and love and fall
Yeah i wanna do it all
It's a mystery but i'm gonna see
Something bigger yeah bigger than me
If i wanna find what's waiting down that road
I gotta go to know
I'm gonna go down that highway find out my way
Cross every river down every byway
Laugh and live and love and fall
Yeah i wanna do it all
It's a mystery but i'm gonna see
Something bigger yeah bigger than me
If i wanna find what's waiting down that road
I gotta go to know
I gotta go to know
