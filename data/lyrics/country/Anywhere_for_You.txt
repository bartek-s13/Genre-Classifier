I'd climb the mountain high
Swim the sea from side to side
Fight a lion and his pride, for you

Run through a landmine field
Go to war without a shield
Jump trains and steal, for you

I'm walkin on a wire
A tight rope over fire
And maybe I'm a fool

But I'd go anywhere for you
(You-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh x3)
I'd go anywhere for you

I'd break you out of prison bars
High-jack and steal a car
Take it way, way too far for you

I'd swim with a great white shark
Walk a graveyard in the dark
Take down the walls around my heart, for you

I'm standing on a ledge
Toes hanging of the edge
And maybe I'm a fool-oeh-oeh-oeh

But I'd go anywhere for you
You-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (yeah I'd go anywhere)
You-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'd go anywhere for you
You-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah I'd go anywhere
For you
I'd go anywhere for you

I'd hold them up and rob a bank
Steal your heart and take the blame
Bite the bullet, walk the plank for you

Lie on a window sill
Dug a house with my bare hands
I'd wear a wedding band for you

Cause baby I'd do anything for you
You-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah I'd go anywhere for you
For you (You-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
For you (You-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Yeah, I'd go anywhere for you
For you (You-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
For you
For you (You-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
For you
I'd go anywhere for you
(You-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'd go anywhere for you
