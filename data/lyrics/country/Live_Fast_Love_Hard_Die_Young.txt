I wanna live fast, love hard, die young
And leave a beautiful memory
I wanna live fast, love hard, die young
And leave a beautiful memory
Don't want slow walkin' or sad singin'
Let 'em have a jubilee
I wanna leave a lot of happy women
A-thinking pretty thoughts of me
I wanna live fast, love hard, die young
And leave a beautiful memory
I got a hot-rod car and a cowboy suit
And I really do get around
I got a little black book and the gals look cute
And I know the name of every spot in town
I wanna find 'em, fool 'em, leave 'em
And let 'em do the same to me
I wanna live fast, love hard, die young
And leave a beautiful memory
I wanna live fast, love hard, die young
And leave a beautiful memory
I'm a Wampus cat, let me grab my hat
And baby, come along with me
We're gonna do some fancy stepping
We're really goin' on a spree
I wanna live fast, love hard, die young
And leave a beautiful memory
Now you may not approve of the things I do
But it really don't bother me
But don't ever think you can tie me down
I'm gonna stay footloose and fancy free
So jump back, make tracks, move out
And let the pretty gals at me
I wanna live fast, love hard, die young
And leave a beautiful memory
