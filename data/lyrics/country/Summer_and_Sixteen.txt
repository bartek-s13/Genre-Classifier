Boy, you better do it now
While you got the chance
Might not have the moves
But she wants to dance
Look at her lookin' at you
You lucky fool
Man, she thinks you're cool
Better grab the moment
While the time is right
It'll come and go
Like a firefly light
She's standin' there shinin'
Like the moon in a July sky
Got your own set of wheels and a full tank of gas
Hold on tight, boy, it's gonna go fast
First real taste of what it's like to be free
Ooh, summer and sixteen
There's a party on the circle
Up on Chapel Hill
Part of me's a-wishin'
I was up there still
With my buddies and a beer
And my first love by my side
It's eleven thirty-five
Gotta leave now
'Cause you can't be late
It's a twenty minute drive
And her daddy won't wait
And you need that last five minutes
For that good night kiss
Man, I miss my own set of wheels and a cheap tank of gas
Hold on tight, man, we were going so fast
First real taste of what it's like to be free
Ooh, summer and sixteen
Sometimes, those memories feel so far away
And sometimes, it seems like yesterday
Got your own set of wheels and a full tank of gas
Hold on tight, boy, it's gonna go fast
First real taste of what it's like to be free
Got your own set of wheels and a full tank of gas
Hold on tight, boy, it's gonna go fast
First real taste of what it's like to be free
Ooh, summer and sixteen
Summer and sixteen
