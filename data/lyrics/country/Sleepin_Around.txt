Feelin' lost in this world of smoke and mirrors
Hungry eyes, pickup lines under neon lights
The good girls wanna be bad, and the bad girls wanna be better
And the boys just wanna get lucky tonight

Uptown, downtown, everybody's sleepin' around
That's all they ever wanna do
I don't wanna sleep around with every girl in the world
I want a girl worth wakin' up to
I want a girl worth wakin' up to

Music fades, bartender yellin' last call
One more lie, one more try at closin' time
Some just wanna be players, some just wanna be played
But nobody wants to be lonely tonight

Uptown, downtown, everybody's sleepin' around
That's all they ever wanna do
I don't wanna sleep around with every girl in the world
I want a girl worth wakin' up to
I want a girl worth wakin' up to

Uptown, downtown, everybody's sleepin' around
That's all they ever wanna do
Uptown, downtown, everybody's sleepin' around
That's all they ever wanna do
I don't wanna sleep around with every girl in the world
I want a girl worth wakin' up to
I don't wanna sleep around with every girl in the world
I want a girl worth wakin' up to
I want a girl worth wakin' up to

I don't want, I don't wanna know
