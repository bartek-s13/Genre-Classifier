Shepherds gaze in wonder
While angel voices sing
This night of nights has come
And brought the world the long-awaited King
The earth is filled with gladness
And yet the heavens weep
For heaven's eyes can see
He was born to die for me
Jesus
Baby Jesus
Is that a tear in your eye
Jesus
Baby Jesus
You must know you were born to die
It must have broken God's heart
For the future He could see
Yet He formed His hands and feet
Knowing one day they'd be nailed to a tree
So all the world could know it
A gift came from above
For God so loved the world
That He gave His only Son
Jesus
Baby Jesus
With a tear of love in your eye
Jesus
Baby Jesus
You knew you were born to die
