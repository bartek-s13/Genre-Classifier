I’m leaving
The words fall out of my mouth
And onto the floor
I am needing
To pack up my bags and walk right out the door
This is goodbye
I’ll roll the windows down
On my green Chevrolet, and I
Don’t know where I’m going
Just know that I can’t stay

Might make it to Memphis
But if that ain’t far enough
I'll speed down the highway to Tulsa, Missoula
So fast that the hurt can’t catch up
I’m burning your memory
One mile at a time
All the way to Tacoma
By then you'll be out of my mind

I’m thinking
With a truck stop song and a cold cup of coffee
That I’m drinking
And I’m hurting like hell
But honey how could I not be
You made me
The joker, the fool
The last one to know so I’m gonna put
Mountains and rivers and deserts between us
Go as far as I can go

Might make it to Memphis
But if that ain’t far enough
I'll speed down the highway to Tulsa, Missoula
So fast that the hurt can’t catch up
I’m burning your memory
One mile at a time
All the way to Tacoma
By then you'll be out of my mind

Might leave some tears in Topeka
A couple of sleepless nights in Cheyenne
Every time that I miss you
I’ll hit the gas as fast as I can
Might make it to Memphis
Past those Kansas City lights
All the way to Tacoma
By then you'll be out of my mind
All the way to Tacoma
By then you'll be out of my mind
