Darling I can see the clouds around you
And in your heart I know a sorrow grows
But if you weep I'll be right there to hold you
Til each tear you cry becomes a rose
(Lorrie)
Dearest love, I know your heart is shattered
And all my words can offer no releif
But my love will heal the pain you suffered
And I'll be here if you should turn to me
(Both)
Darling I can see the clouds around you
And in your heart I know a sorrow grows
But if you weep I'll be right there to hold you
Šµil each tear you cry becomes a rose
(Keith)
In deepest nights when memories tend to gather
Lay with me and put your fears to sleep
Cause there's no pain; no dream can put asunder
All the love that binds you and me
(Both)
Darling I can see the clouds around you
And in your heart I know a sorrow grows
But if you weep I'll be right there to hold you
Til each tear you cry becomes a rose
