I'm rockin' this black dress, leaving red lipstick
On the rim of this rocks glass, it's going to my head
I'm talking to somebody who's checking out my body
Buying me rounds and not looking down at my phone

'Cause you need to feel me gone
Feel me slipping away
Wonder if I'm coming home, feel the cold
While you're lying there alone wide awake
Yeah you need to feel me gone

I'm letting him hold on, dancing to a slow song
Closing my eyes, toes on the line
I won't cross, but let it cross your mind

'Cause you need to feel me gone
Feel me slipping away
Wonder if I'm coming home, feel the cold
While you're lying there alone wide awake
Yeah you need to feel me gone
Yeah you need to feel me gone

I'm gonna leave here by myself
And check in to a hotel
And sleep in in the morning as a warning

You need to feel me gone
Feel me slipping away
Wonder if I'm coming home, feel the cold
While you're lying there alone wide awake
Yeah you need to feel me gone, gone
Ooh you need to feel me gone, mmh
