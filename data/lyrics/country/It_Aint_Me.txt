I think it's time we called it quits
I don't know much but I sure didn't sign up for this
Tired of the cussin', tired of the fightin'
Sick of all your reasons and all your damn whinin'
I don't know about you, but I think we're done

You can call up your friends, cry to your momma
Talk shit about me, start a whole lot of drama
I really don't care what you do as long as I ain't around
You can go out and party with everybody you know
Throw back some longnecks and hit a few tokes
I don't give a damn if you screw everybody you see
As long as it ain't me

Been callin' my phone every damn day
Sayin' lets work it out, girl there's no way
I know it ain't what you wanted to hear
Probably get mad and choke back a few tears
But, Karma's got a way of comin' back around

You can call up your friends, cry to your momma
Talk shit about me, start a whole lot of drama
I really don't care what you do as long as I ain't around
You can go out and party with everybody you know
Throw back some longnecks and hit a few tokes
I don't give a damn if you screw everybody you see
As long as it ain't me
You can call up your friends, cry to your momma
Talk shit about me, start a whole lot of drama
I really don't care what you do as long as I ain't around
You can go out and party with everybody you know
Throw back some longnecks and hit a few tokes
I don't give a damn if you screw everybody you see
As long as it ain't me
