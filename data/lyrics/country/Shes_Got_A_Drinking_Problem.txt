The lady wears the latest styles
And drives a foreign car
She's not the kind You'd ever find
Around a crowded bar
Just one look and you can tell
She's high society
But she's got a drinkin' problem
And it's me
Yes I'm the only black mark
On the lady's life
The one mistake she ever made
Comes home to her each night
There's no way for her to hide it
All the world can see
She's got a drinkin' problem
And it's me
You can find her every Tuesday
At the bridge club
With her friends
The lady's social calendar
Never seems to end
But there's one thing
That always brings
Down he dignity
She's got a drinkin' problem
And it's me
Yes I'm the only black mark
On the lady's life
The one mistake she ever made
Comes home to her each night
There's no way for her to hide it
All the world can see
She's got a drinkin' problem
And it's me
She's got a drinkin' Problem
And it's me
