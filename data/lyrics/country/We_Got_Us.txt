Here we are making all our big plans
Jumping way into the deep end
Hey girl, why don't we just leave tonight
Pack it up drive until the road ends
Feels like this can be the moment
We've been waiting on all our lives
We know we're ready
It may sound crazy
'Cause we got no money
Nothing on our own, honey
Got your daddy all worried
'Cause times are tough
We got love, baby
It don't sound like much maybe
There ain't no way that's not enough
'Cause we got us
They say life's not a love song, I think everybody's all wrong
So far, forever sounds good to me
We've got California moonlight
Enough gas to make it to the sunrise
And two hearts believing
That's all we'd need
Nothing here's missing
This is what I call living
'Cause we got no money
Nothing of our own, honey
Got your daddy all worried
'Cause times are tough
We got love, baby
It don't sound like much maybe
There ain't no way that's not enough
We got us
Oh, we've come too far to turn around
Nothing can stop us, not now
Someday we're gonna laugh
At the way things used to be
When we had no money
Nothing of our own, honey
We had your daddy all worried
'Cause times were tough
We got love, baby
It don't sound like much maybe
There ain't no way that's not enough
'Cause we got us, 'cause we got us, yeah, yeah
