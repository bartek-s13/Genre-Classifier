You're the one
You're the one
That made me cry
You're the one
That laughed at me
Then said goodbye
You're the one
You're the one
That made me blue
So how's it feel
Now that you're the one
It's happened to

Now you're back calling me with open arms
What happened to the one you met with all that charm
You say he's gone
And you're alone
Well that's a shame
But if you think real hard
I know you'll see
Just who's to blame

You're the one
You're the one
That made me cry
You're the one
That laughed at me
Then said goodbye
You're the one
You're the one
That made me blue
So how's it feel
Now that you're the one
It's happened to

You're begging me to think about the love we shared
Yet it seems to me not too long ago you didn't care
The love you left
No longer lives
Within my heart
The game you played
So recklessly
Tore it all apart

You're the one
You're the one
That made me cry
You're the one
That laughed at me
Then said goodbye
You're the one
You're the one
That made me blue
So how's it feel
Now that you're the one
It's happened to

Oh tell me how's it feel now that you're the one
How's it feel to be the one
How's it feel now that you're the one it's happenin' to
