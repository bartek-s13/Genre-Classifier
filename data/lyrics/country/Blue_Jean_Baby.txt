You're my, you're my
You're my, you're my
Blue jean baby
You're my, you're my
Blue jean baby

Girl you can bet I don't think of you
Up here there ain't no reason to
It could be the miles, it could be the time
As soon as I cross those county lines
Maybe it's the smell of the wild flowers
Or our spray painted names on the water tower
Or how these streets used to be ours
But girl it takes me back

To my little small town famous blue jean baby
That girl next door had closet crazy
Baby you ought to see her when she was smilin'
Where every single memory is hidin'
You keep my first time teenage heartbeat beatin'
With a pick up where we left off feelin'
Every time I find my way back home
I got to find a way to get back over you

Just a couple miles to my mama's place
When my heart made my wheels go the long way
It could be the light in your room, shadow of you
The way everything seems to lead me to

To my little small town famous blue jean baby
That girl next door had closet crazy
Baby you ought to see her when she was smilin'
Where every single memory is hidin'
You keep my first time teenage heartbeat beatin'
With a pick up where we left off feelin'
Every time I find my way back home
I got to find a way to get back over you

So what do you say, what do you say?
We kick a little dust up down on memory lane?
So hop in the car, I wanna get away

To my little small town famous blue jean baby
That girl next door had closet crazy
Baby you ought to see her when she was smilin'
Where every single memory is hidin'
You keep my first time teenage heartbeat beatin'
With a pick up where we left off feelin'
Every time I find my way back home
I got to find a way to get back over you
(Small time famous) Had a crazy girl
Blue jean baby
I got to find a way to get back over you
