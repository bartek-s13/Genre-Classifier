The first man that you ever loved
Left your mama and never said goodbye to anyone
And you were raised with your head held high
But any fool can see it's just a clever disguise
You're nobody's baby
You're nobody's darlin'
You're nobody's girl
You've always been a little scared to open your heart
And you never let anybody take it too far
You never let ?em on the inside
'Cause you're always scared you'll be taken for a ride
You're nobody's baby
You're nobody's darlin'
You're nobody's girl
Everybody wants you but you don't want to care
So you keep ?em at a distance with the frown you wear
You spend your time trying to even the score
And you've got it in your head you deserve a lot more
The first one was a true disaster
So was the second one and every one after
But when you're breaking in a broken home
You're gonna be sure to spend some nights on your own
When you're nobody's baby
You're nobody's darlin'
You're nobody's girl
You're nobody's baby
You're nobody's darlin'
You're nobody's girl
You're nobody's girl
