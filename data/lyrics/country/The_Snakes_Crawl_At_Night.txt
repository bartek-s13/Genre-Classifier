Oh the snakes crawl at night, that's what they say
When the sun goes down, then the snakes will play
I watched that car pull right up into my driveway
Saw a shadow slip away from my house
So I hurried straight and looked in her room
And I found out that it was my loving spouse
Oh, the snakes crawl at night, that's what they say
So I waited in the shadows until morning
And the gun I held was trembling in my hand
No, I did not plan to give them any warning
Cause the devil on my shoulder had command
Oh, the snakes crawl at night, that's what they say
When the sun goes down, then the snakes will play
Oh the trial in a little while was over
And they sentenced me to die right away
But before I leave this courtroom please, Your Honor
There's something more that I would like to say
All the snakes crawl at night, that's what they say
When the sun goes down, then the snakes will play
