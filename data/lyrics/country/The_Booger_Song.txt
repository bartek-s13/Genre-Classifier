I was sittin' in my car, waitin' for the light to change
When the guy next to me had his finger up his nose
And his face was all deranged
I rolled down the window and I started to chuckle
His finger was buried right up to his knuckle
I can't help nut stare 'cause I can't believe what I see
When he pulls it out, it's a picture of pain
On the end of his finger's a piece of his brain
And with a smile on his face he flicks it right at me

Talkin' 'bout boogers, talkin' 'bout boogers, talkin' 'bout boogers
You get 'em everyday
Talkin' 'bout boogers, talkin' 'bout boogers, yeah them boogers
They're here to stay

They've been flicked on the seat, flung in the air
Wiped on the sofa, smeared in the chair
Put 'em in your pocket, save it for a rainy day
You remember the winter, how cold the wind felt
When your boogers would freeze and then they'd melt
And with one big sniff they'd go away

Talkin' 'bout boogers, talkin' 'bout boogers, talkin' 'bout boogers
You get 'em everyday
Talkin' 'bout boogers, talkin' 'bout boogers, yeah them boogers
They're here to stay
Well some you dig for and some you can't find
Some are rock hard and some are slime
Some make you whistle when you try to sleep at night
But the ones I hate the most I suppose
Are the ones that cling to a hair in your nose
And you can't get 'em out no matter how hard you try

Talkin' 'bout boogers, talkin' 'bout boogers, talkin' 'bout boogers
You get 'em everyday
Talkin' 'bout boogers, talkin' 'bout boogers, yeah them boogers
They're here to stay
