If any ship don't sink, if any star don't fade
If there's a heart still beatin' when every other breaks
When the storm rolls in, when the fires rise
When the odds are slim and the stakes are high

My money's on you, money's all in
You don't ever fall without getting up again
If anybody's coming out gunning
When the push comes down to the shovin'
Every high tide, every tight rope
Every jump when you just don't know
If anyone I know is gonna come through
My money's on you

A fearless heart and a restless soul
I look up to you though I never told you so

My money's on you, money's all in
You don't ever fall without getting up again
If anybody's coming out gunning
When the push comes down to the shovin'
Every high tide, every tight rope
Every jump when you just don't know
If anyone I know is gonna come through
My money's on you, my money's on you

Till the sun burns out, till the night don't fall
My least dime, I'd bet it all
The only one to turn a grey sky blue
But you should know by now what I'd do

My money's on you, money's all in
You don't ever fall without getting up again
If anybody's coming out gunning
When the push comes down to the shovin'
Every high tide, every tight rope
Every jump when you just don't know
If anyone I know is gonna come through
Standing strong just like you always do
My money's on you, my money's on you
