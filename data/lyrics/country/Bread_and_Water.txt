One night he wandered into that old mission
The one out on the poor side of town
He really had no interest in salvation
Just a place to lay his drunk ole body down
He said, Ma’am I sure am hungry
And I don’t have a penny to my name
Lord knows I hadn’t worked in a month of Sundays
I’m dirty, dead broke and so ashamed
I need bread and water, ma’am that’s all I need
Bread and water, and a place to rest my feet
I ain’t too proud to get down on my knees
For bread and water’s free
She said, you’re always welcome at this table
Said, brother you look like you could use a friend
And there’s no need to pay if you’re not able
Cause even Jesus was a homeless Man
Well she opened up the Word and started reading
About the Savior and the woman at the well
Said it ain’t for me to judge this life you’re leading
There’s only two things can save your soul from hell
It’s bread and water, man that’s all you need
Bread and water, and a place to rest your feet
If you ain’t too proud to get down on your knees
The bread and water’s free
When he bowed his head he kinda choked up
They spoke every word of Our Lord’s Prayer
He closed his eyes and never woke up
He’ll find bread and water waiting there
Bread and water, man that’s all you need
Bread and water, and a place to rest your feet
Bread and water, man that’s all you need
Bread and water, brother just believe
If you ain’t too proud to get down on your knees
The bread and water’s free
Bread and water’s free
