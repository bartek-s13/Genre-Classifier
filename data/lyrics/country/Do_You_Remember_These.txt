Saturday morning serials chapters 1 through 15
Fly paper, penny loafers, Lucky Strike Green
Flat tops, sock hops, Studebaker, Pepsi please
Ah, do you remember these?
Cigar bands on your hand, your daddy's socks rolled down
Styx nose plugs and aviator caps with flaps that button down
Movie stars on Dixie Cup tops and knickers to your knees
Ah, do you remember these?
The hit parade, grape Tru-Aid, the Sadie Hawkins dance
Pedal pushers, duck tail hair, and peggin' your pants
Howdy-Doody, Tutti-Frutti, the seam up the back of her hose
Ah, do you remember those?
James Dean, he was keen, Sunday movies were taboo
The senior prom, Judy's mom, rock and roll was new
Cracker Jack prize, stars in your eyes, ask daddy for the keys
Ah, do you remember these?
The bogeyman, lemonade stand, and takin' your tonsils out
Indian burn and wait your turn and four foul balls you're out
Cigarette loads and secret codes and savin' lucky stars
Can you remember back that far?
To boat neck shirts and fender skirts and crinoline petticoats
Mum's the word and a dirty bird and a double root beer float
Moon hub caps and loud heel taps and he's a real gone cat
Ah, do you remember that?
Dancin' close, little moron jokes, and cooties in her hair
Captain Midnight, Ovaltine, and The Whip at the County Fair
Charles Atlas Course, Roy Roger's Horse, and only The Shadow knows
Ah, do you remember those?
Gable's charm, Frog in your arm, loud mufflers, pitchin' woo
Going steady, Veronica and Betty, white bucks, and Blue Suede Shoes
Knock Knock jokes: Who's there? Dewey. Dewey who?
Do we remember these? Yes we do. Ah, do we, do we remember these
