Written by: Steve Rice
I know I missed you party again
I've always had trouble being the man that you want me to be
And I know you wore that red dress you were shining like a diamond
I'm somewhere down in Texas trying to find a way
To give you everything
Chorus:
Baby I can't sleep when I can't get you out of my mind
You cut so deep in this dark hotel room I can't unwind
Set me Free so I can run to you again
Take me back, take me home to your red dress
We knew it wouldn't be easy living this way
Hours on hours days upon days on a hard worn highway
I know I made a promise that I intend to keep
I said I'd never leave you now you're all alone in my sheets
You're wondering where I am
Solo
Repeat Chorus
