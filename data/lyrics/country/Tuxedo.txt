He don't need no coat and tie
Don't need no black and white
He don't need no red carpet, cameras flashing in his eyes
Oh, no
Cause his feet are on the ground
And he's grounded in his roots
My baby looks so sexy out there
Working in his boots
Oh, you should know

Oh my man
He's got them real strong hands
And after working all day
Out in that hot sunshine
He comes walking in always looking so fine
Oh my heart
Lights up like shooting stars
He’s like a knight in shining armor
With them blue jeans on
Dirty white tee
And my baby don't need no
Tux - tux - tuxedo
Tux - tux - tuxedo
Don't need no
Don't need no
Tuxedo

I don't need no diamond rings
Don't need no shining car
He makes me feel so fancy
When I'm laying in his arms
Oh, you should know

Oh my man
He's got them real strong hands
And after working all day
Out in that hot sunshine
He comes walking in always looking so fine
Oh my heart
Lights up like shooting stars
He’s like a knight in shining armor
With them blue jeans on
Dirty white tee
And my baby don't need no
Tux - tux - tuxedo
Tux - tux - tuxedo
Don't need no
Don't need no
Tuxedo

He's like a George Strait choir type
He knows the difference in wrong and right
And he gives me just what I like
All night
And he's mine, all mine

Oh my man
He got them real strong hands
And after working all day
Out in that hot sunshine
He comes walking in always looking so fine
Oh my heart
Lights up like shooting stars
He’s like a knight in shining armor
With them blue jeans on
Dirty white tee
And my baby don't need no
Tux - tux - tuxedo
Tux - tux - tuxedo
Don't need no
Don't need no
Tuxedo

He don't need no
Tux - tux - tuxedo
Tux - tux - tuxedo
Don't need no
Don't need no
Tuxedo
He don't need no
