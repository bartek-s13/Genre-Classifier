Rachel pays good money for the clothes she wears
For her there's nothing gained without a cost
Twice a week she comes to see me now
And twice a week she leaves me lost
Somewhat like a kid she is at forty two
Her slender body shows the miles
Two husbands gone, Lord and one's still at home
They gave her money, but no child
CHORUS
Her starving body craves a man to love
While in her heart, she wants a child
I'm just the answer to a mother's love
And to a young girl's hungry eyes
Now Rachel she's the leading lady of this town
She plays the role as smooth as ice
She's the woman standing behind her man
And I'm just the kid behind the wife
Rachel taught me things I guess I'd have never known
Like how this world is run on pride
If you can't see yourself with nothing on
Then you've got nothin' left to hide...
CHORUS
