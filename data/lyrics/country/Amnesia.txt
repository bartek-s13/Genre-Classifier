If I had amnesia
I wouldn't know how much I need ya
And I wouldn't have to see ya
Every night when I turn off the lights and close my eyes
I wouldn't have to forget you
Or even know I'd ever met you
I wouldn't to regret you or let you wreck me one more time

What I don't know wouldn't hurt me
If I could lose my memory
I think maybe I'd be fine if I just lost my mind
I wouldn't have to replace you
I could just erase you
And I wouldn't have to know how much I need ya

If I had amnesia
Something stronger than tequila
A little pill that would lead you right out of my head
And get me numb instead
If I went a little crazy
The movie got a little hazy
I wouldn't want you to save me
May be, you can play me one time

What I don't know wouldn't hurt me
If I could lose my memory
I think maybe I'd be fine if I just lost my mind
I wouldn't have to replace you
I could just erase you
And I wouldn't have to know how much I need ya

And if I woke up tomorrow
Wasn't thinking about yesterday
And you were just a stranger
It wouldn't kill me to watch you walk away

And what I don't know wouldn't hurt me
If I could lose my memory
I think maybe I'd be fine if I just lost my mind
I wouldn't have to replace you
I could just erase you
And I wouldn't have to know how much I need ya
If I had amnesia, if I had amnesia
