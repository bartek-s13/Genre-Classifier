All my rowdy friends have settled down
And they seem to be more into laid back songs
Nobody wants to get drunk and get loud
Everybody just wants to go back home
I myself have seen my wilder days
And I have seen my name at the top of the page
But I need to find a friend just to run around
But no one wants to get high on the town
And all my rowdy friends have settled down

And I think I know what my father meant when he sang about a lost highway
And old George Jones I'm glad to see he's finally getting straight,
And Waylon's staying home and loving Jessi more these days
And nobody wants to get drunk and get loud
And all my rowdy friends have settled down

And the hangovers hurt more then they used to
And corn bread and ice tea took the place
Of pills and ninety-proof,
And it seems like none of us do things quite like we used to do
And nobody wants to get high on the town
And all my rowdy friends have settled down

Yeah I think I know what my father meant when he sang about the "Lost Highway"
And Johnny Cash don't act like he did back in
'68
And Kris he is a movie star and he's moved off to L.A.
And nobody wants to get drunk and get loud
And all my rowdy friends have settled down
Yeah me and my rowdy friends done rowdied on down
