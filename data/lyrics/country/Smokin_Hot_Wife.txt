I walk around with a big fat grin
I can't believe how lucky I've been
Like Opie and Andy, the Mayberry life
With my kids and my dogs and my smokin' hot wife
I got a truck and some land
And I play in a band with my friends on a Saturday night
I thank God for the good life
I'm fightin' the good fight
From my porch in the swing by my smokin' hot wife
I ain't much to look at, so I don't know how
I ended up with the milk and the cow
We're off to Daytona, we're packed in tight
My kids and their friends and my smokin' hot wife
I got my toes in the sand, an ice tea in my hand
And I'm livin' out the fantasy life
I look out at the ocean and yell for more lotion
From my chair at the beach by my smokin' hot wife
She's so fine...
And she's all mine...
I'm a fortunate man and I fold my hands on my knees every night
I'm thankin' sweet Jesus 'cause when everyone see us they say:
Holy Pete how did he get a smokin' hot wife?
He's got some kids and some dogs and a smokin' hot wife
He's got a porch and a swing and a smokin' hot wife
She's so fine
She's all mine
