We got debutantes and socialites
And mamas from the PTA
We got bachelorettes dressed up in white
And little black dress divorcees

Long live the blues
They're keeping me in business
Some wanna dance and some wanna party
Whatever they need, they call me

Mr. Lonely, Mr. Good-Time
Mr. One-You're-Gonna-Want-On-A-Saturday-Night
When you're lonely, lying in the dark
I'm the number that you know by broken heart
No, I ain't Mr. Right, I'm Mr. Right-Now
The one all the girls are talking about
The one and only, Mr. Lonely

Yeah, some are in from outta town
Just lookin' for some fun
For a couple of hours or more
Yeah, I can be the one

Long live the blues
I'm booked up to November
You can find me in the book or on a bathroom wall
When they all want a rendezvous, they call

Mr. Lonely, Mr. Good-Time
Mr. One-You're-Gonna-Want-On-A-Saturday-Night
When you're lonely, lying in the dark
I'm the number that you know by broken heart
No, I ain't Mr. Right, I'm Mr. Right-Now
The one all the girls are talking about
The one and only, Mr. Lonely

Oh, play that steel, Paul

So if you got a girl, you better treat her right
You better never tell a lie
You better never start a fight
'Cause when she hangs up on you
Guess who's on the other line?
He's never hard to find

Mr. Lonely, Mr. Good-Time
Mr. One-You're-Gonna-Want-On-A-Saturday-Night
When you're lonely, lying in the dark
I'm the number that you know by broken heart
No, I ain't Mr. Right, I'm Mr. Right-Now
The one all the girls are talking about
The one and only, Mr. Lonely
The one and only, Mr. Lonely
Long live the blues
