What they wanna do? (Sip the drank)
What they wanna do? (And get drunk)
What they wanna do? (Get fucked)
What they wanna do? (Off the drugs)
What they wanna do?
She just really wanna fuck with a thug
What they wanna do?
She just really wanna fuck with the plug
What they wanna do? (Sip the drank)
What they wanna do? (And get drunk)
What they wanna do? (Get fucked)
What they wanna do? (Off the drugs)
What they wanna do?
She just really wanna fuck with a thug
What they wanna do?
She just really wanna fuck with the plug

Valentino wallet, hallway pass on my neck
Darrel turn into a Billy Blanks when I flex
In the gym, I'm working on my planks, on my pecs
Tip beneath and feel my whole chain up against
Money chase, won't stop until I get a bill
Shit is real, now designers wanna chill
All these bitches in my face wanna cop a feel
And they wanna lick the diamonds on the grill

I want a ring, I wanna floss
I wanna mink, I want a board
I wanna pink, diamond across
Slap that ass, round of applause
Fuck you mean? I am the boss
You ain't the man, you lyin' of loss
Talking about you, livin' it large
Nigga, you lyin', you lyin' to floss
Can't get a whip but you buying a car
I'm with your broad
Bottoms up, drop it down of course
She got plenty hips, ooh
And she plenty thick
Seen the nudes but I never seen her gyming pics

What they wanna do? (Sip the drank)
What they wanna do? (And get drunk)
What they wanna do? (Get fucked)
What they wanna do? (Off the drugs)
What they wanna do?
She just really wanna fuck with a thug
What they wanna do?
She just really wanna fuck with the plug
What they wanna do? (Sip the drank)
What they wanna do? (And get drunk)
What they wanna do? (Get fucked)
What they wanna do? (Off the drugs)
What they wanna do?
She just really wanna fuck with a thug
What they wanna do?
She just really wanna fuck with the plug

This is from my niggas
Niggas, they die to the struggle
All these racks up on my hands like I'm Bonny Rubble
I be dripped up in the Rollie and then cop me a bubble
Double platinum, I'm the man
I'm gon' rap on some bubbles (Ahh, yeah, yeah)
She in lace, all these diamonds in my face (Whoop whoop)
Before I eat it, she the goddess, gotta say my grace (Yeah)
All them legs, baby, I just want a taste (Whoop)
Built a cake, why you never cuttin' to the chase?

I want a ring, I wanna floss
I wanna mink, I want a board
I wanna pink, diamond across
Slap that ass, round of applause
Fuck you mean? I am the boss
You ain't the man, you lyin' of loss
Talking about you, livin' it large
Nigga, you lyin', you lyin' to floss
Can't get a whip but you buying a car
I'm with your broad
Bottoms up, drop it down of course
She got plenty hips, ooh
And she plenty thick
Seen the nudes but I never seen her gyming pics

What they wanna do? (Sip the drank)
What they wanna do? (And get drunk)
What they wanna do? (Get fucked)
What they wanna do? (Off the drugs)
What they wanna do?
She just really wanna fuck with a thug
What they wanna do?
She just really wanna fuck with the plug
What they wanna do? (Sip the drank)
What they wanna do? (And get drunk)
What they wanna do? (Get fucked)
What they wanna do? (Off the drugs)
What they wanna do?
She just really wanna fuck with a thug
What they wanna do?
