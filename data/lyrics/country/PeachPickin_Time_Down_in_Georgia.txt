When it's peach pickin' time in Georgia
Apple pickin' time in Tennessee
Cotton pickin' time in Mississippi
Everybody picks on me
When it's roundup time in Texas
The cowboys make whoopee
Then down in old Alabama
It's gal pickin' time to me

Dee-ho-del-lay-ee, ho-ley-ee eh, dee-ho-del-lay-ee

There's the bluegrass down in Kentucky
Virginia's where they do the swing
Carolina now I'm coming
To you to spend the spring
Arkansas I hear you calling
I know I'll see you soon
There's where I'll do a little pickin'
Underneath the Ozark moon

Dee-ho-del-lay-ee ho, ho-lay-ee ho, ho-lay-ee
Now, when hard times overtake you
I hope they don't get me
For I've got a sweetie waiting
For me down in Tennessee
I know I'm going to see her
I hope it won't be long
There's where we'll pick a little cabin
And call it our mountain home

Dee-ho-del-lay-ee oh, dee-ho-del-lay-ee ho, dee-ho-del-lay-ee

When the pickin' 'an pick the cotton
I'll pick a wedding ring
We'll go to town and pick a little gown
For the wedding in the Spring
I hope the preacher knows his business
I know he can't fool me
When it's peach pickin' time in Georgia
It's gal pickin' time to me

Dee-ho-del-lay-ee oh, dee-ho-del-lay-ee oh, dee-ho-del-lay-ee
