I'm a little drunk tonight, tryin' to write this song
Tryin' to get it right, but it might turn out all wrong
How do you say the simplest thing, when what you feel ain't simple at all?

I'm a little bit over my head, but I can' hold back no more
I'm a little bit scared to death, 'cause I ain't been here before
Yeah I'm a little bit unsure what the hell I'm supposed to do
But I'm a whole lot in love with you
I'm a whole lot in love with you

The words on this page all look like a mess
They all fall short of what I'm tryin' to confess
My heart is racin' it already knows, what I haven't even told you yet

I'm a little bit over my head, but I can't hold back no more
I'm a little bit scared to death, 'cause I ain't been here before
Yeah I'm a little bit unsure what the hell I'm supposed to do
But I'm a whole lot in love with you
I'm a whole lot in love with you

What if I say it and you just laugh?
What if I say it and you say it back?
I'm a little in over my head, but I can't hold back no more
I'm a little bit scared to death, 'cause I ain't been here before
Yeah I'm a little bit unsure, what the hell I'm supposed to do
But I'm a whole lot in love with you
I'm a little bit over my head, but I can't hold back no more
I'm a little bit scared to death, 'cause I ain't been here before
Yeah I'm a little bit unsure what the hell I'm supposed to do
But I'm a whole lot in love with you

Yeah, I'm a whole lot in love with you
I'm a whole lot in love with you
Yeah, I'm a whole lot in love baby
I'm a whole lot in love with you
Yeah yeah yeah
