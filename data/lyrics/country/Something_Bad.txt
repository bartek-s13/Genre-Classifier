Pullin' up into your drive, you're
Hoppin' in the passenger side
You gimme that look from across the cab
Reach on over and steal my ball cap
Lookin' like some trouble I can get into
Never seen nothin' quite like you
Wherever we go, let's get there fast
Take it on, off of the map, cuz

The stars are creepin' out
That moon is shinin' down
A tank full of gas with nowhere to be
Find a little spot, park it underneath the trees
The radio's turned down low
Ain't no light by the dashboard glow
Lost in eachother, no-one knows where we're at
Lookin' like a good night to do something bad
(Lookin' like a good night to do something bad)

Phone's blowing up but you don't take the calls
You turn it off, cuz I'm turnin' you on
Follow tire tracks to where we were before
Now you got me going girl

The stars are creepin' out
That moon is shinin' down
A tank full of gas with nowhere to be
Find a little spot, park it underneath the trees
The radio's turned down low
Ain't no light by the dashboard glow
Lost in eachother, no-one knows where we're at
Lookin' like a good night to do something bad
(Lookin' like a good night to do something bad)

We're goin' all the way
But we didn't go far cuz

The stars are creepin' out
That moon is shinin' down
A tank full of gas with nowhere to be
Find a little spot, park it underneath the trees
The radio's turned down low
Ain't no light by the dashboard glow
Lost in eachother, no-one knows where we're at
Lookin' like a good night to do something bad
(Lookin' like a good night to do something bad)
(Lookin' like a good night to do something bad)
(Lookin' like a good night to do something bad)
(Yeah)
