I didn?t have the money for that half-carat ring
But when you tried it on you didn?t have to say a thing
I bought it
Yeah I bought it
And that split level house with an in ground pool
You dipped your toes in, said ?Wouldn?t this be cool?
So I bought it
You know those hazel green eyes drive me crazy
I fold like a tent in a windstorm baby
Hook line and sinker you got me again
I can?t help but cave in
Guess the seven-year itch didn?t take that long
Said you just needed space, trust me nothing is wrong
And I bought it
Yeah I bought it
You swore up and down there was no other guy
Nobody else would believe that lie
But I bought it, yep
You know those hazel green eyes drive me crazy
I fold like a tent in a windstorm baby
Hook line and sinker you got me again
I can?t help but cave in
When you called to tell me that you were comin? back
That you had a change of heart and you were already packed
I was surrounded by bikinis on a beach in Cancun
I told you I missed you and I?d be comin? home soon
And you bought it
