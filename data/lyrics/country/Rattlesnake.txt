Windmills (and palm jack?), this old forgotten town
Load us devils, starts light up the ground
Train whistle blowing can't you hear that lonesome sound
Just keep on rolling through the darkness moving through your town
Well now drinkin' Old Crow Whiskey don't mean that you can fly
Could be high than a mountain, might not touch the open sky
Keep on spinning round in circles
Get back down on the ground
Get back down on the ground
Disciple of the highway, wild as a rattlesnake
Roller coaster flippin' over
Push and pull, give and take
Just a modern day drifter, steel bells wearin' thin
Still tryin' to break the ties that bind me, this old _ back again
Well now drinking Old Crow Whiskey don't mean that you can fly
Could be high than a mountain, might not touch the open sky
Keep on spinnin' round in circles
Get back down on the ground
Get back down on the ground
Windmills (and palm jack?), this old forgotten town
Train whistle blowing can't you hear that lonesome sound
Well now drinkin' Old Crow Whiskey don't mean that you can fly
Could be high than a mountain, might not touch the open sky
Keep on spinnin' round in circles
Get back down on the ground
Get back down on the ground
