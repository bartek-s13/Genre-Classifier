That Sunday drive playlist that we sang along to
Always knew every word
That corner booth at the diner off of 6th and Park
Where we started to fall first
Our favorite TV shows, those friends that we both know
Memories in photos

You ain't gonna ruin that for me, nah, nah
You ain't gonna be what I think about, weighing me down
I'm still doin' what I like, just 'cause you said goodbye
Ain't gonna change my life
You ain't gonna ruin that for me, nah, nah
Nah, nah, oh, oh, oh-oh

There'll be that girls night out, just hangin' with my friends
You walk in like you're so proud
And I'm wearin' those ripped jeans like when you first met me
That night at the fairgrounds
I ain't gonna run and hide, I ain't gonna go and cry
I'm gonna have a good time

Baby, you ain't gonna ruin that for me, nah, nah
You ain't gonna be what I think about, weighing me down
I'm still doin' what I like, just 'cause you said goodbye
Ain't gonna change my life
You ain't gonna—

Ruin that road that we drove, windows rolled down
No, I ain't changin' the station playing our songs
I got it turned up loud as it goes
And you ain't on my mind

You ain't gonna ruin that for me, nah, nah (No, you won't)
No, you ain't gonna ruin that for me, nah, nah
You ain't gonna be what I think about, weighing me down
I'm still doin' what I like, just 'cause you said goodbye
Ain't gonna change my life
You ain't gonna ruin that for me, nah, nah (Ruin that for me, baby)
Nah, nah, oh, oh, oh-oh (No)

You ain't gonna ruin that for me, nah, nah (Ruin that for me, baby)
Nah, nah, oh, oh, oh-oh
