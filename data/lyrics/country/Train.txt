There's a thousand stars that I could chase
A million hours I could waste
To wind up somewhere I don't wanna be
There's a house on a mile-high mountain
The kinda money that you just quite countin'
That kind of thing don't do a thing for me

I should be climbin' that ladder to the top
Should be pushin' that limit non-stop
Bringin' every last second of the clock overtime
But there's a train I need to catch
There's a fire that needs a match
There's a girl I need to sing to sleep tonight

There's a sweet sound runnin' 'round my head
Like a heartbeat in your chest
Callin' me with a long, lonesome sound
I'll be steel wheels spinnin' and a-sparkin'
Kerosene lantern just a-runnin' in the darkness
Park this heart right where your heart is
And slow on down

I should be climbin' that ladder to the top
Should be pushin' that limit non stop
Bringin' every last second of the clock overtime
But there's a train I need to catch
There's a fire that needs a match
There's a girl I need to sing to sleep tonight
You are waiting, I'm anticipatin'
Holdin', feelin' every breath you're breathin'

I should be climbin' that ladder to the top
Should be pushin' that limit non stop
Bringin' every last second of the clock overtime
I should be climbin' that ladder to the top
Should be pushin' that limit non stop
Bringin' every last second of the clock overtime
But there's a train I need to catch
There's a fire that needs a match
There's a girl I need to sing to sleep tonight
(Sing to sleep tonight, sing to sleep tonight)
There's a girl I need to sing to sleep tonight
