Blown down the highway by two different winds
Lord only knows when I'll see you again
You're 'bout as close as the stars up above
You're my long distance love
Kentucky Bluebird, I heard your song today
But when I try to touch you, you fly away
Blue is a feeling I'm learning so well
Turn on the TV in another hotel
Turn down the volume and stare at the wall
God I wish you would call
Kentucky Bluebird, I heard your song today
But when I try to touch you, you fly away
How I hate the miles between us
They get longer each day
I had this dream and you should have seen us
Holding each other and drifting away
Kentucky Bluebird, I heard your song today
But when I try to touch you, you fly away
You fly away
