Your head's on my chest
This bed's all a mess
Empty bottle of red wine
And I can tell it was a good night
Sunlight's peekin' in
Kissin' on your skin
And I don't wanna say goodbye

'Cause when you love me like you do
Girl there ain't nothin' sweeter
I can't keep my hands off you
Oh and if I'm bein' honest
My heart's fallin' I can't stop it, it's true
Ain't nobody in the world gonna love me like you do

I just wanna be alone with you
Locked in for a day or two
Somewhere on a beach front
Steamin' up my old truck
You got me feelin' all paper thin
'Cause you crashed in makin' my head spin
Again and again

'Cause when you love me like you do
Girl there ain't nothin' sweeter
I can't keep my hands off you
Oh and if I'm bein' honest
My heart's fallin' I can't stop it, it's true
Ain't nobody in the world gonna love me like you do
Hey
Nobody baby
Oh baby, yeah

I've been to a lot of different places
Seen smiles on a million different faces
And I ain't never met anybody like you

'Cause when you love me like you do
Girl there ain't nothin' sweeter
I can't keep my hands off you
Oh and if I'm bein' honest
My heart's fallin' I can't stop it, it's true
Ain't nobody in the world gonna love me like you do
Ain't nobody gonna love me like you do, no
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Ain't nobody gonna love me like you do, no
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
