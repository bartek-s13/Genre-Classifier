I hate this here I am running into you, trying not to touch
I hate this acting like it's not killing me when it does
And that watch I gave you still looks good on your wrist
Don't you think it's time we end this little experiment?

'Cause I know we said we'd just be friends
I can't lie and I can't pretend
Boy, I've tried and bottom line is
I still love you and I hate this

I hate this missin' you, hoping you're somewhere missin' me
I hate this hoping you'll call, hoping I'm awake when it rings
If we took this break to figure out what we wanted (What we wanted)
Well, I want us back, don't need another night to sleep on it

'Cause I know we said we'd just be friends
I can't lie and I can't pretend
Boy, I've tried and bottom line is
I still love you and I hate this
Mmm, I hate this

My heart's breakin', I can't take this
Time and space, it sucks, I hate this
My heart's breakin', I can't take this
Time and space, I swear, I hate this
I know we said we'd just be friends
I can't lie and I can't pretend
Boy, I've tried and bottom line is
I still love you and I hate this

Here I am running into you, trying not to touch (Mmm, I hate this)
Acting like it's not killing me when it does
