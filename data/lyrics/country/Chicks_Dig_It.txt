Daddy's belt, Momma's drapes
Standin' tall on the backyard shed
Lookin' cool in my superman cape
I told the neighborhood girl, said hey y'all watch this
My fate was a broken arm, my reward one big kiss
When daddy asked me why I did it
I made him laugh out loud when I told him
Cause the chicks dig it

Scars heal, glory fades
And all we're left with are the memories made
Pain hurts, but only for a minute
Yeah life is short so go on and live it
Cause the chicks dig it

Black top road, learner permit
Thought I was Earnhardt
Drivin' fast but I didn't see the ditch
Took out a mailbox, then a fence and then a barn
The police came and called my father
But I met the farmer's daughter
And when the judge asked me why I did it
He threw the book at me when I told him
Cause the chicks dig it

Just throw caution to the wind, my friend
Then sit back and watch your life begin, cause


Scars heal, glory fades
And all we're left with are the memories made
Pain hurts, but only for a minute
Yeah life is short so go on and live it
It don't matter if you lose or if you win it
Hey the chicks dig it
The chicks dig it (x3)
