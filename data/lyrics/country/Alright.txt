Alright, alright
Yeah, it's alright, alright

Don't need no five star reservations
I got spaghetti and a cheap bottle of wine
Don't need no concert in the city
I got a stereo and the 'Best Of Patsy Cline'

Ain't got no caviar, no Dom Perignon
But as far as I can see I got everything I want

Because I got a roof over my head
The woman I love laying in my bed
And it's alright, alright
I got shoes under my feet
Forever in the eyes staring back at me
And it's alright, alright
Yeah, I got all I need
And it's alright by me

Maybe later on we'll walk down to the river
Lay on a blanket and stare up at the moon
It may not be no French Riviera
But it's all the same to me as long as I'm with you

May be a simple life but that's okay, yeah
If you ask me baby, I think I've got it made

Because I got a roof over my head
The woman I love laying in my bed
And it's alright, alright
I got shoes under my feet
Forever in the eyes staring back at me
And it's alright, alright
Yeah, I got all I need
And it's alright by me

When I lay down at night I thank the lord above
For giving me everything I ever could dream of

Because I got a roof over my head
The woman I love laying in my bed
And it's alright, alright
I got shoes under my feet
Forever in the eyes staring back at me
And it's alright, alright
Yeah, I got all I need
And it's alright by me
