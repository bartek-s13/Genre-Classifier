I can see you got your eye on this old cowboy
And I can tell you've never had one for your own
Or you've never been around one
Now you're thinkin that you've found one
Well, it might be kinda fun to take him home

You giggle every time that I say yes ma'am
And I get this feelin' if I held you tight
You'd be seein' his-and-hers buckles, boots, and spurs
But that's a feelin' you'll get over overnight

'Cause whatcha gonna do with a cowboy
When that old rooster crows at dawn
When he's lyin' there instead
Of gettin' out of bed
And puttin' on his boots and gettin' gone
What you gonna do when he says, "Honey
I've got half a mind to stay"
What you gonna do with a cowboy
When he don't saddle up and ride away?

You see, it takes a special kinda woman
To put with the life a cowboy leads
Cause his boots are always muddy
And his beer drinkin buddies
Will camp out on your couch and never leave

Don't even start to think you're gonna change him
You'd be better off to try and rope the wind
What you see is what he's got
And he can't be what he's not
And honey, you can't hide him from your friends

So whatcha gonna do with a cowboy
When that old rooster crows at dawn
When he's lyin' there instead
Of gettin' out of bed
And puttin' on his boots and gettin' gone
What you gonna do when he says, "Honey
I got half a mind to stay"
Whatcha gonna do with a cowboy
When he don't saddle up and ride away

Yeah, what you gonna do with a cowboy
When he don't saddle up and ride away?
