I'm okay, I'm alright
Hurricanes and train wrecks only last one night
Would you believe all I've been through?
Had the hands of tempted fate, oh, if you only knew
What it costs, how I wait, what I got, what I gave
I'm still here, after the heartache
After the storm blew through, I kept me and it saved me
I'm still standin' right where you left me
On a cold dark cloud with nowhere to fall but down
Like a single, naked, unrelenting tear, I'm still here
There was darkness all around me
There were times that I was sure I was drowning
There were people, who tried to reach me
But no matter how they loved me, I kept sinking
I got tired on my own hand, I reached inside and I saved myself
I'm still here, after the heartache
After the storm blew through, I kept me and it saved me
I'm still standin' right where you left me
On a cold dark cloud with nowhere to fall but down
Like a single, naked, unrelenting tear, I'm still here
This time I can survive
I ain't dying on nobody else's cross
I ain't sufferin' on more unforgivin' loss, oh, no
I'm still here, after the heartache
After the storm blew through, I kept me and it saved me
I'm still standin' right where you left me
On a cold dark cloud with nowhere to fall but down
Like a single, naked, unrelenting tear, I'm still here, I'm still here
