Driving down a county road
So in love with you
Landslide on the tape deck
A little warble coming through
1996 you were 22
And we were getting married
That’s the only thing I knew

We shoveled horse shit for an hour
To get you done by five
And then I took you out to supper
At that little country dive
Just outside of Eldridge
With all the old farmers
And their wives

We got into a fight
You were smoking cigarettes
I walked a hundred yards away
And I climbed up on a fence
You always asked me why I loved you
But no reason would suffice
All the words that I could give you
Could never meet your price
Now I’m doing dishes
With my little girl
Landslide comes on the radio
And maybe nothing in this world
Could make time arc back this way
And touch upon itself again
A little warble in my heart
For how I loved you then
