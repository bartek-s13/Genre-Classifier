A orchid is a flower that blooms so tenderly
It thrills the fairest lady of the land
If placed beside a blushing rose the rose could not compare
But how was such as I, to understand
I overlooked an orchid while searching for a rose
The orchid that I overlooked was you
The rose that I was searching for has proved to be untrue
The orchid that I find my dear was you
The rose has lost it's color, but the orchid stays the same
And I'm alone to face these lonely years
I didn't see the orchid, I was searching for a rose
And now I pay the price with bitter tears
I overlooked an orchid while searching for a rose
The orchid that I overlooked was you
The rose that I was searching for has proved to be untrue
The orchid that I find my dear was you
The orchid that I find my dear was you...
