You don't know the meaning of uncontrolled desire
You were always hanging just above the fire
Now and then you come close enough to just stay warm
And you think that you win cause you never give in
Because you've never been burned
Ah, but you're gonna learn
That you don't know love
Till it's chilled you to the bone
Turned you inside out
Left you all alone
You don't know love
Till you've watched it die and then
You have to try again
You don't know love
Like a child you wander out into the storm
You defy the thunder, but the lightning keeps you warm
The innocence you show is something I'd like to know
And I'm feeling that I'm finally crossing the line
But I won't be alone -
Yes, I've known all along
That you don't know love
Till it's chilled you to the bone
Turned you inside out
Left you all alone
You don't know love
Till you've watched it die and then
You have to try again
You don't know love
No you don't know love
