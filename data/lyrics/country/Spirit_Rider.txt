On a moonbeam there might come a spirit rider
Who'll be watching for a flickering in the gloom
He will put a feeler out for love and welcome
And he just might cast a shadow across your room

I will scent out any evidence of danger
I will test the air around my sugar shack
If my heart knows you won't treat it like a stranger
And if the fire is lit I'll be riding back

Before you know it you will see a spirit rider
Cut me off babe and I'll be gone
I will mount my high oh and I will ride off ma'm
And I'll go on and on and on and on and on
The lies you lay in one ear will blow out the other
Let a storm rage on me on my outward tac

If I hear bluebirds I won't go any farther
And if the sky gets clear I'll be riding back

I will ramble, drift and range
And you'll be walking round imaginary things upon the floors
Walk in circles 'round the reasons that have vanished
You'll forget what doesn't matter anymore
You might get a glimpse of me off in the distance
If you cry out I might hear you on the wind
And if the mountains echo your love to me
Wave your heart and I'll be riding back again
Wave your heart and I'll be riding back again
