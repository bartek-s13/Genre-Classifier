Thanks
Thanks a lot
I got a broken heart
That's all I've got
You made me cry
Now I cried a lot
I lost your love
Baby thanks a lot
You told our friends
As I was passin' by
That you're not sorry
That you made me cry
You said I deserve
Just what I got
Well if that's how you feel
Honey thanks a lot
Thanks thanks a lot

You wanted a fool
And I played the part
Now all I've got
Is a broken heart
We loved a little
And laughed a lot
Then you were gone
Honey thanks a lot
