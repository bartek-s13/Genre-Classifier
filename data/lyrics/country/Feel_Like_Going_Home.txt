Lord I feel like going home
I tried and failed and I`m tired and weary
Everything I ever done was wrong
And I feel like going home
Lord I tried to see it through
But it was too much for me
And now I`m coming home to you
And I feel like going home
Cloudy skies are rolling in
And not a friend around to help me
From all the places I have been
And I feel like going home
Repeat 1st verse
