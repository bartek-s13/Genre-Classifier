Hey Mr ting-a-ling steel guitar man
Play me some lonesome as sad as you can
My baby has left me for some other man
Play on Mr ting-a-ling steel guitar man
Play me a song that will bring on the tears
Make me remember those beautiful years
Play me a picture of her if you can
Play on Mr ting-a-ling steel guitar man
Play me the shadows of my lonely room
Cry like a whippoorwill lost in the gloom
I love her I miss her don't you understand
Play on Mr ting-a-ling steel guitar man
Hey Mr ting-a-ling steel guitar man...
