A smile, what a smile
Look at that face
It ain't hard to tell
What's going on these days
No it ain't no secret, you can see it
Oh, it's everywhere she goes
There ain't nothing like a woman
With that look in her eyes
You know there's someone somewhere
That's been treating her right
She's shining like that diamond
Right there on her left hand
And, oh, what it do, when it does what it does
Ain't nothing like a woman, a woman in love
Move every move
Feet off the ground
So high on the ride
Way up in them clouds
No she ain't falling, she's all in
And loving everywhere she's at
There ain't nothing like a woman
With that look in her eyes
You know there's someone somewhere
That's been treating her right
She's shining like that diamond
Right there on her left hand
And, oh, what it do, when it does what it does
Ain't nothing like a woman, a woman in love
Oh yeah
There ain't nothing like a woman
With that look in her eyes
You know there's someone somewhere
That's been treating her right
She's shining like that diamond
Right there on her left hand
And, oh, what it do, when it does what it does
Ain't nothing like a woman, a woman in love
Oh and everyday I'm thanking the good lord above
For sending me this woman, this woman in love
