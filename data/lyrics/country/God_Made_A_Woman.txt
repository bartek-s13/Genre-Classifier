I used to tear up the roads in this old town
Every bar I'd find open, I'd close it down
That 2 AM last call, man I'd answer
I'd burn that candle at both ends
'Til it met in the middle, just smoldering
I was searching for something I didn't even know I was after

Then God made a woman fall for a man
Didn't have much going, but his life began when she took his hand
The sky turned blue, the clouds parted, light shined on a lonely heart
When God made a woman

Never gave him a reason to bless me at all
And I still can't believe that an angel would fall
For a guy like me, guess he sees who needs saving
Every night I hit my knees again, thanking the Lord she's a lot like him
She loves me with a grace that's truly amazing

Yeah, God made a woman fall for a man
Didn't have much going, but his life began when she took his hand
The sky turned blue, the clouds parted, light shined on a lonely heart
When God made a woman
He made the moon, he made the sun
But the best thing to me that he's ever done
God made a woman
Yeah, God made a woman

God made a woman fall for a man
Didn't have much going, but his life began when she took his hand
The sky turned blue, the clouds parted, light shined on a lonely heart
When God made a woman

When God made a woman
Yeah, yeah
God made a woman
