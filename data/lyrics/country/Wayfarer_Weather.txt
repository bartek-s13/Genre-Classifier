Ain't no corn in that field
Big crack in the windshield
From that January cold snap
Baby don't look back
I got the wheel, yeah
329, Miles to the shoreline
Sunset on the billboard
Girl that's what we're in for
Yeah that's a good sign
No I can't wait to get there
Cover you up in blue sky
Gettin you outta here
Put your shades on, Lay it back, Enjoy the ride
You and me together On our way to better
Wayfarer weather, Wayfarer weather
Yeah
No it won't be long now
We'll be rollin these windows down
You'll be pullin that sweater off
Puttin on a summer song and
Crankin it up loud, yeah
No I can't wait to get there
Cover you up in blue sky
Gettin you outta here
Put your shades on, Lay it back, Enjoy the ride
You and me together on our way to better
Wayfarer weather, Wayfarer weather
Gotta get you outta here
Gotta get you underneath the sun
When I see you lyin there
You bikini top girl and I'm done
Can't wait to get there
No I can't wait to get there
Cover you up in blue sky
Gettin you outta here
Put your shades on, Lay it back, Enjoy the ride
You and me together On our way to better
You and me together On our way to better
Wayfarer weather, Wayfarer weather
Gotta get you otta here
Gotta get you underneath the sun
