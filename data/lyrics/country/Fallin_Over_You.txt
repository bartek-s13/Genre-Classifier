Love, love, so overused and underrated
Tossed 'round, without a second thought
You make me feel like the world stopped turning
Sometimes you gotta just let go, ready or not
(Woah-oh-oh)
Baby, I'm fallin', fallin', fallin'
(Woah-oh-oh)
Feels like I'm jumpin' on the moon
(Woah-oh-oh)
Whatever you call it, call it, call it
Feels like I'm flyin'
Fallin' over you
I pushed, pulled, even tried to force it
But love has a mind of its own
I thought I could rise up above it
Baby, when you're this high
There's only one way to go
(Woah-oh-oh)
Baby, I'm fallin', fallin', fallin'
(Woah-oh-oh)
Feels like I'm jumpin' on the moon
(Woah-oh-oh)
Whatever you call it, call it, call it
Feels like I'm flyin'
Fallin' over you
Every time I see you
I throw away the parachute
There's no fear in fallin' over you
Woah-oh-oh
Baby, I'm fallin'
(Woah-oh-oh)
Baby, I'm fallin', fallin', fallin'
(Woah-oh-oh)
Feels like I'm jumpin' on the moon
(Woah-oh-oh)
Whatever you call it, call it, call it
Feels like I'm flyin'
Oh yeah, it feels like I'm flyin'
Fallin' over you
(Woah-oh-oh)
Fallin' over you
(Woah-oh-oh)
