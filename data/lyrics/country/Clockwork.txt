Might as well have my alarm
Set on my phone girl
It's like you got a camera
Don't know how you know
I'm home alone girl
Come around 10:47 every Friday night
Might as well leave the light on
'Cause you're always right on time

You call, I say hello
You knock, I'm letting you in
You say you've missed my lips
We kiss, here we go again
Your dress, my shirt
We love, I live and never learn
I crash, I burn, you leave, I hurt
Like clockwork

It's like I'm walking down the street
And fall in that same trap girl
I see a freight train coming
And I just stand there on the tracks girl
Somebody'd be getting rich if they were placing bets
On me thinking no, no, no, always saying yes
You call, I say hello
You knock, I'm letting you in
You say you've missed my lips
We kiss, here we go again
Your dress, my shirt
We love, I live and never learn
I crash, I burn, you leave, I hurt
Like clockwork

It's too easy, you know my street
And you know where I leave my key
Baby you know me, I can count on you to count on me
It's like a movie I've seen a thousand times
I hate the end but I still hit rewind

You call, I say hello
You knock, I'm letting you in
You say you've missed my lips
We kiss, here we go again
Your dress, my shirt
We love, I live and never learn
I crash, I burn, you leave, I hurt
Like clockwork
Like clockwork, clockwork
Clockwork
Like clockwork, clockwork
