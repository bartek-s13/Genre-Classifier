Diamond rings and cocaine
They're both one in the same
You spend a whole month's pay check
On something you'll probably regret

Just my money down the drain
Yeah I'mm drownin' in this pain
I think we need some time apart
Now I've got these shakes in my heart

Diamond rings and cocaine
They're both one in the same
You spend a whole month's pay check
On something you'll probably regret

Yeah my eyes they shined so bright
For that girl dressed in white
Pick me up just to let me down
Got people talkin' all over town

'Bout them diamond rings and cocaine
They're both one in the same
You spend a whole month's pay check
On something you'll probably regret

I hate to say where ya gone
Withdrawals are worse when I'm alone
My mind's racin' and my body's tired
I can't control what my heart desires
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Diamond rings and cocaine
They're both one in the same
You spend a whole month's pay check
On something you'll probably regret

Diamond rings and cocaine
They're both one in the same
You spend a whole month's pay check
On something you'll probably regret

Something you'll probably regret
Hell yeah I love regrets
