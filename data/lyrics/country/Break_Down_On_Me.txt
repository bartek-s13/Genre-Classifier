Girl I've got the keys to my dad's Bronco
It runs a little hot but if we take it slow, it'll get us places
Won't win no races but maybe it'll get us where we can talk alone
I can tell there's a storm brewing in your eyes
I can't stand to see you sad
Yeah I hate to see you cry
Gonna make it better
I'm good at putting things back together
Just so you know, you can break down on me

Break down on me
Girl I don't mind
I'm used to fixing things back right
So let me hear what's on your mind
Get it off your chest tonight
Ain't got nowhere to be
Break down on me

Sometimes this ol' world can kick you where it hurts
Good thing you got a cheer-you-back-up chauffeur
Knows the right tracks to play to get your mood, your groove back
We can crank it on up to 10
Oh but if that mockingbird don't sing
I got a few more tricks up my sleeve
So don't you worry 'bout it
Just go on, get it all out, girl
I'm gonna get you smiling again
You can break down on me
Break down on me
Girl I don't mind
I'm used to fixing things back right
So let me hear what's on your mind
Get it off your chest tonight
Ain't got nowhere to be
Break down on me

Break down on me
Girl I don't mind
I'm used to fixing things back right
So let me hear what's on your mind
Get it off your chest tonight
Ain't got nowhere to be
Break down on me

Break down on me
Girl I don't mind
I'm used to fixing things back right
So let me hear what's on your mind
Get it off your chest tonight
Ain't got nowhere to be
Break down on me
Break down on me
