I wanna move to the rhythm of your heartbeat and loose myself tonight
Baby you bring me to my feet the minute you walk by
With your red lips, white tee, shaking them hips in skinny blue jeans
Can't help but hum along your freedom gets me high

And we can dance like no one else is watching
Take my hand and put it on your heart
Sing out loud cause no one gets me rocking like you
You're my anthem
You, you're my anthem
You, you're my anthem

I wanna see those fireworks lighting up your eyes
I wanna know your melody and get it memorized
You're my chorus, you're my verse pledge allegiance every word
Turn it up and turn me on now baby don't be shy

And we can dance like no one else is watching
Take my hand and put it on your heart
Sing out loud cause no one gets me rocking like you
You're my anthem
You, you're my anthem
You, you're my anthem
I just wanna sing ya all night long
Take me to the early light of dawn
I just wanna sing ya all night long
Take me to the early light of dawn

And we can dance like no one else is watching
Take my hand and put it on your heart
Sing out loud cause no one gets me rocking like you
You're my anthem
You, you're my anthem
You, girl you're my anthem
You, you're my anthem
You, you're my anthem

No one else is watching
Take my hand and put it on your heart
Sing out loud cause no one gets me rocking like you
You're my anthem
