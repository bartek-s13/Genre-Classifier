Waking up to a girl I’ll never love
Happiness fucks with me just like she does
Words are all thrown about feels like a game
Kiss me or fuck me it all feels the same
Empty my chest, nothing to see
Holding back because my past isn't free
Hop in the car when I'm feeling a cut
Wrists are marked red 'cause the blade is so blunt
God damn, hold up my hand
Baby I love you I'm only a man
Clutching your chest when I'm just waking up
Shaking the dreams from my head I'm so numb
Yuh
Spilling my piece 'cause my heart is insane
Changing my sheets just to swap out the stains
Death is my friend, silence is sweet
Roses are red like the flush in your cheeks
Waking up to a girl I’ll never love
Happiness fucks with me just like she does
Words are all thrown about feels like a game
Kiss me or fuck me it all feels the same
Kiss me or fuck me it all feels the same
Words are all thrown about feels like a game
Happiness fucks with me just like she does
Waking up to a girl I’ll never love
Will you save me?
'Cause I can save you
Don't betray me
Baby stay please
Do you love me?
Because I love you
Will you save me?
'Cause I can save you
Will you save me?
'Cause I can save you
Will you save me?
'Cause I can save you
