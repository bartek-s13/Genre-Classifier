I was just walking out the door I'm sorry you didn't come before
I waited so long so long so long and there's no time to wait anymore
You will never know but no too long ago what this day to me might have been
And I love you as much as before but I'm so tired of just walking the floor
I must be on my way that's all I can say and I was just walking out the door
I was just walking out walking out the door
