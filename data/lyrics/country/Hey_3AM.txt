Hey 3 am
Here we are again
Been a while since I’ve seen you
How you been?  
I could say I missed you
But that would be a lie
It’s funny how you ain’t around
When things are going right
But as soon as my walls go caving in
It’s Hey 3am
You haven’t changed a bit
You’re still full of questions
Making minutes feel like hours
When you get me second guessing
Turning lies to truth
Grains of sand into mountains
Each one of them a problem
With no clear way around 'em
So I’ll just wait til that sun comes shining in
Knowing everything be alright again
Hey 3 am
You got me wide awake
Hitting rewind on my choices and all my mistakes
You’re the only one who sees me
When I’m a total mess
I guessing that I should thank you
For the secrets that you’ve kept
Like whispers in the dark between old friends
You haven’t changed a bit
You’re still full of questions
Making minutes feel like hours
When you get me second guessing
Turning lies to truth
Grains of sand into mountains
Each one of them a problem
With no clear way around 'em
So I’ll just wait til that sun comes shining in
Knowing everything be alright again
Hey 3am
Hey 3am
There’s Nothing I can do
Yesterday’s long gone now and so are you
Gotta make the most of today
And hope tonight you won't hear me say
Hey 3 am
