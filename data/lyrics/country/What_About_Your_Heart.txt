You got out with no bruises or scratches
You broke free with no visible scars
I’ve just got this one question to ask ya
Baby, what about your heart
You would stand with no shoes on the hot sun
Do anything to always hit your mark
You were cast as the all around good one
Baby, what about your heart
You’re gonna break down and call me
It might be days or weeks
You’ll cry and you’ll say that you’re falling
From grace right into me
You don’t want who they want you to fall for
Try and try, but it just breaks apart
You feel bad cause you know that you need more
Baby, what about your heart
You’re gonna break down and call me
It might be days or weeks
You’ll cry and you’ll say that you’re falling
From grace right into me
You’re fighting battles in your head
Cause we’ve made a mess of what God said
You know where I will be when you’re ready
When that day comes I won’t feel so far
I’ll be the one with the whisper so steady
Baby, what about your heart
Baby what about your heart
