Baby you could steal my heart like Jesse James
Come in, guns blazin', just like ol' John Wayne
Well now's your chance to save the girl
Better take it 'fore it's gone
Yeah you better get your boots on

Love me like the wild, wild, wild west
Ride me off in the sunset
Outlaws makin a run for it
Well come on boy, be my cowboy
Keep me by your side all night
And hold me tight like a pearl handle .45
And just let me be the whiskey on your breath
And love me like the wild, wild, wild west

Wanna feel like we jumped a train to Santa Fe (desperados makin our getaway)
Like we're desperados makin' our getaway (like we jumped a train to Santa Fe)
I wanna hide away on some prairie
Underneath a blanket of stars
And just get lost in your arms

And love me like the wild, wild, wild west
Ride me off in the sunset
Outlaws makin a run for it
Well come on boy, be my cowboy
Keep me by your side all night
And hold me tight like a pearl handle .45
And just let me be the whiskey on your breath
And love me like the wild, wild, wild west

Love me like the wild, wild, wild west
Love me like the wild, wild, wild west

Love me like the wild, wild, wild west
Ride me off in the sunset
Outlaws makin a run for it
Well come on boy, be my cowboy
Keep me by your side all night
And hold me tight like a pearl handle .45
And just let me be the whiskey on your breath
And love me like the wild, wild, wild west
Love me like the wild west

Baby you could steal my heart like Jesse James
We'll go out, guns blazin', just like ol' John Wayne
