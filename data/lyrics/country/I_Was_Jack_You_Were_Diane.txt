It was yesterday
It was years ago
We were singing every word on the radio
Kinda like them songs could save our souls
Somehow, someway
We was falling fast
We was jumping in
Blue jean halo hanging off the limb
Two American kids just like them
Every time they played
And it blew us away

Do you turn it up?
Do you sing along
Every time you hear that song?
Like we did then
Like we did when
Do you close your eyes?
Does it make you laugh?
Do the memories take you back
To six packs and a Chevy Cheyenne?
Way back
When I was Jack and you were Diane
Yeah, and the music played
Yeah, we were never growing up and growing old
Breaking up or letting go
Girl's just like Rock-n-Roll
Where has it gone?
But I hope like hell every now and again
I blow across your mind like that summer wind
And you're holding on to 16 as long as you can
Every time that it comes on

Do you turn it up?
Do you sing along
Every time you hear that song?
Like we did then
Like we did when
Do you close your eyes?
Does it make you laugh?
Do the memories take you back
To six packs and a Chevy Cheyenne?
Way back
When I was Jack and you were Diane

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Do you turn it up?
Do you sing along
Every time you hear that song?
Does it still move you?
Baby, Hallelujah (Hallelujah)
Do you close your eyes?
Does it make you laugh?
Do the memories take you back
To six packs and a Chevy Cheyenne?
Way back
When I was Jack and you were Diane

Yeah, way back
Way on back
When I was Jack and you were Diane
Yeah, do you close your eyes?
Does it make you laugh?
When I was Jack and you were Diane
Yeah, let the memories take you back
Take you back
Take you back
