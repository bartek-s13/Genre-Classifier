We bought that champagne for New Year’s, we got one bottle left
Let's pop it open, baby what you say?
Stay in that T-shirt, you don’t need to get dressed
'Cause we got plans to make no plans today
I'm thinking happy hour, on the hour
In the kitchen, in the shower
Dancing tipsy, come and kiss me baby
Let's get a little day drunk
Party with our shades on
Play a bunch of old songs
Sing along, get the words wrong (Who cares!)
When you're day drunk
Get down while the sun's up
Make a little good love like it's date night
In the daylight and it feels right when you're...
Day drunk, day drunk, yeah when you're...
Day drunk, day drunk
Remember that bottle of whiskey that we bought for your dad
Yeah we got time to buy another one before his birthday, right?
Let's make today the best that we've ever had
'Cause I'm high on your smile and when you look at me that way
No you don't need no makeup, leave your hair up
Ain't no guest list, girl it's just us
Before the sun sets, baby let's get crazy
And get a little day drunk
Party with our shades on
Play a bunch of old songs
Sing along, get the words wrong (Who cares!)
When you're day drunk
Get down while the sun's up
Make a little good love like it's date night
In the daylight and it feels right when you're...
Day drunk, day drunk, yeah when you're...
Day drunk, day drunk, yeah-yeah
(Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
I'm thinking happy hour, on the hour
Get a good buzz on and now we're
Dancing tipsy, sing it with me baby
And get a little day drunk
Party with our shades on
Play a bunch of old songs
Sing along, get the words wrong (Who cares!)
When you're day drunk
Get down while the sun's up
Make a little good love like it's date night
In the daylight and it feels right when you're...
Day drunk, day drunk (Who cares!) yeah when you're...
Day drunk, day drunk (Who cares!) yeah when you're...
Day drunk, day drunk (Cause all I wanna do)
(Is get a little bit drunk with you)
Day drunk, day drunk
