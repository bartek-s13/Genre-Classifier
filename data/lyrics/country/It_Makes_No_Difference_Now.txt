Makes no difference now what kind of life they hand me
I'll get along without you now that's plain to see
I don't care what happens next cause I'll get by somehow
I don't worry cause it makes no difference now
It was just a year ago when I first met you
I learned to love you and I thought you loved me too
But that's all in the past and I'll forget somehow
I don't worry cause it makes no difference now
(Now that we have really parted I can't believe we're through
I don't blame myself I'm sure I can't blame you
There was something had to happen and it happened somehow
I don't worry cause it makes no difference now)
After all it's said and done I'll soon forget you
Although I knew that it will be so hard to do
Let things happen as they will and I'll get by somehow
I don't worry cause it makes no difference now
