Hello, I've been waiting for you
I didn't know if you'd recognize my voice
Cause I've been whispering your name again and again
I've been imagining this day and I'll never be the same

Welcome home
Welcome home
It's so good to see your face
Welcome home

We dance and sometimes only fall
We sing even when there are no words
And I hope love lifts you up again and again
And if you ever lose your way, let me be the first to say

Welcome home
Welcome home
It's so good to see your face
Welcome home

Come inside from the cold and rest your weary soul
You belong, you are loved, you are wanted
You're not alone
I've missed you so

Welcome home
Welcome home
Without you here, it's not the same
And I've been waiting here
Welcome home
