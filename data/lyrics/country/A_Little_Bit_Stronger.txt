Woke up late today and I still feel the sting of the pain
But I brushed my teeth anyway
I got dressed through the mess and put a smile on my face
I got a little bit stronger

Riding in the car to work and I'm
Trying to ignore the hurt so I
Turned on the radio
Stupid song made me think of you
I listened to it for minute
But then I changed it
I'm getting a little bit stronger
Just a little bit stronger

And I'm done hoping
That we could work it out
I'm done with how it feels
Spinning my wheels
Letting you drag my heart around
And, oh, I'm done thinking
You could ever change
I know my heart will never be the same
But I'm telling myself I'll be okay
Even on my weakest days
I get a little bit stronger
It doesn't happen overnight but you
Turn around and a month's gone by
And you realize you haven't cried
I'm not giving you a hour or a second or another minute longer
I'm busy getting stronger

And I'm done hoping
That we could work it out
I'm done with how it feels
Spinning my wheels
Letting you drag my heart around
And, oh, I'm done thinking
You could ever change
I know my heart will never be the same
But I'm telling myself I'll be okay
Even on my weakest days
I get a little bit stronger

Getting along without you baby
I'm better off without you baby
How does it feel without me baby?
I'm getting stronger without you baby
And I'm done hoping
That we could work it out
I'm done with how it feels
Spinning my wheels
Letting you drag my heart around
And, oh, I'm done thinking
You could ever change
I know my heart will never be the same
But I'm telling myself I'll be okay
Even on my weakest days
I get a little bit stronger

And just a little bit stronger
A little bit
A little bit
A little bit stronger
Get a little bit stronger
