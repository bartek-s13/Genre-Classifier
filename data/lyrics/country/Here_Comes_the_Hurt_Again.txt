Here comes that hurt again
You'd think I'd learn
The more that I believe in love
The more I get burned
I'm lying right here again
So close to the flame
Here comes that hurt again
But I'm used to the pain
I wanna say I love you
But this is not the time
And even though I'm holding you
God, I know he's still on your mind&46
Someone else to hind in
Behind your simple smile
Now I've been hurt like this before
Honey, not in quite a while
Here comes that hurt again
You'd think I'd learn
The more that I believe in love
The more I get burned
I'm lying right here again
So close to the flame
Here comes the hurt again
But I'm used to the pain
Here comes the hurt again
But I'm used to the pain...
