Sometimes I wish you just...
Well, if I told you what I'm really thinkin', it might make you blush
Yeah, but baby, so what?
And I don't wanna rush
We've been pretending we're just friends and all that stuff
For long enough, yeah

I'm thinkin’ babe tonight
We start blurrin' up the lines

Go 'head, get out of your head
Think you're overthinking, use your lips instead
Cause what you want I want, I think it's easy to see, yeah
I know you're a little bit shy
But if I'm gonna be honest, baby, so am I
You're on the sidelines wasting time when you could be winning with me
All them days are over, all them red lights are green
So move on, move on, move on
Make your move on me

I can't count on twenty hands
The nights I spent up wondering what it'd be like if you was my man
No, baby I can't
No, I can't help myself
Your touch is hypnotic, I want it
It ain't nothing like I've felt
From no one else, yeah

So I'm thinkin’ babe tonight
We start blurrin' up the lines

Go 'head, get out of your head
Think you're overthinking, use your lips instead
Cause what you want I want, I think it's easy to see, yeah
I know you're a little bit shy
But if I'm gonna be honest, baby, so am I
You're on the sidelines wasting time when you could be winning with me
All them days are over, all them red lights are green
So move on, move on, move on
Make your move on me

If it ain't real love, I don't wanna pretend
Cause I got plenty of 'em, I don’t need another friend
So, start comin' up with some trouble to get in tonight, so

Go 'head, get out of your head
Think you're overthinking, use your lips instead
Cause what you want I want, I think it's easy to see, yeah
I know you're a little bit shy
But if I'm gonna be honest, baby, so am I
You're on the sidelines wasting time when you could be winning with me
All them days are over, all them red lights are green
So move on, move on, move on
Make your move on me
