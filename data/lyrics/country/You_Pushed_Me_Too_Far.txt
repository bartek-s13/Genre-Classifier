I stood by while you flirted with my friends
I held my tongue while you kicked me on my shins
But this morning I found a strange necktie on the floor board of our car
Someday you'll push me a little bit too far
I'll forgive you this time but don't ever let it happen again
Some day you're gonna push me just a little bit too far ah of course you did not
Well you thought I'd be working all night long
You had the nerve to bring your boyfriend in our home
And now that I have found out what kind of wife you are
Some day you'll push me a little bit too far
Do what oh you want us to go up to our favorite spot on the mountain and make up
Make up after what you've done to me
Well honey I'm just like putty in your hands
Okay come on let's broke the mountain yeah up the mountain
Drive all way to top honey here we are
It's like old times just bein' here with you
Honey come a little closer over here that's it now you can get a better view yeah
You say you'll never cheat again ah ah you don't know how right you are
Cause now I've pushed you a little bit too far
