He was tough, said he'd lived a good long life
And he'd seen it all, watching 82 years fly by
And three kids grow up
Seen 'em all have kids and grandkids of their own
He was brave
If he was scared, well, you couldn't see it on his face
Like a soldier he marched through his numbered days
Made his peace with God and he was gone
I cried, oh I cried
Tried to hold my head high, ended up in my hands
I cried, oh I cried
There was nothing I could do, so that was all I could do
She was strong
Held his hand when he was barely holding on
She told him, "Don't worry about me, I'll get along
You go on to Heaven. Go on, yes."
Now she's alone, livin' the life that's too much for one
Just last night on the telephone
I could hear the lonelyin her voice
I cried. Oh I cried
Tried to hold my head high, ended up in my hands
I cried, oh I cried
There was nothing I could do, so that was all I could do
I cried, oh I cried
Tried to hold my head high, ended up in my hands
I cried, oh I cried
There was nothing I could do, so that was all I could do
Oh, there was nothing I could do, so I cried
