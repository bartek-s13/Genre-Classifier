Do not drink backslider's wine
As the rain ruins my alibi
I'm down to tellin' you my troubled mind
It's not the sun bright path
That made me leave my home
It's that fine Backslider's wine
My momma sings out in my memory
Son, don't drink no red eyed shine
Fight for your rights
But,don't just fight for right
And do not drink Backslider's wine
(Break)
I took myself to be a strong and loving soul
Til I found myself, face down on the bar room floor
Crying my god what has become of me
I dare not drink Backslider's wine no more
My momma sings out in my memory
Son, don't drink no red eyed shine
Fight for your rights
But,don't just fight for right
And do not drink Backslider's wine
Do not drink Backslider's wine
