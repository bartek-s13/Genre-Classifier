Aw you have really pretty eyes
What?
I can't hear you
Oh ok
Hm yeah you can add me on snapchat
Here give me your phone
Ok message me

Kiss me through the air my love
Unraveling your sex my love
I’m tryna see that ass my love
And pretend that you're my only one
Baby show me all the right things
Because your body is the sight to see
But never will I fall in love
Babe I won't fall

Fake love, fake love
They tryna sell me fake love
Fake love, fake love
Fake love, fake love
They tryna sell me fake love
Fake love, fake love
Tell me where you go when you ain’t here
Lost in the dark when you ain't near
Empty bottles, empty bags, it's all I know
And all I feel is fake love everywhere I go
I'm not someone who can take this
All the lies, all the games, all the fake shit
If you can't be real then just say that
Fake love, fake love, that's the game they playing

Fake love, fake love, they tryna sell me fake love
Fake love, fake love, fake love, fake love
They tryna sell me fake love, fake love
Fake love, fake love
They tryna sell me fake love
Fake love, fake love
Fake love, fake love
They tryna sell me fake love
Fake love, fake love
