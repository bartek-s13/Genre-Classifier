I screamed your name out
To the top of the night
You said do you think you could hear a sound
With no one in sight
Turned on the weather
Joined up the stars and the clouds
You said tonight is a night that great stories
Are written about
All you need to know
I'll get you out of here
All you need to know
I'll get you out of here
Hold on to your horses
But don't hold your breath
I'll get you out of here
It seems we always are saying goodbye
You say all it takes is a long distance call
To keep your spirits high
I keep a promise
Just as you keep me in line
And as hard as it seems we will be there
One step at a time
All you need to know
I'll get you out of here
All you need to know
I'll get you out of here
Hold on to your horses
But don't hold your breath
I'll get you out of here
All you need to know
I've got my heart set on you and I making it on our own
All you need to know
So when you're ready
Set your sail to south
Before you leave the shores I'll be there
Building our own treehouse
And I'll scream your name out
To the top of the night
And you'll say do you think you could hear a sound
With no one in sight
All you need to know
I'll get you out of here
All you need to know
I'll get you out of here
Hold on to your horses
But don't hold your breath
Hold on to your horses
Don't hold your breath
I could be drowning in water
Burning in flames
But I'll get you out of here
