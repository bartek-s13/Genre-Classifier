It's finally payday
Meeting the boys at my place
All cleaned up, pile in the truck man
I can barely wait
Hear the band roar
From across the dance floor
Like they know that something good is on the way
It's a Friday night like any other
You walk in I stare and I stutter
Every single time you look at me
I need a fix, a true companion
Jimmy Beam or old Jack Daniels
Anything to send me on my way
Drinking up my courage
Whiskey for my nerves
You got me drunk on your short summer dress ballroom ballerina
I'm gonna need a-
‘Nother shot of glory
Ain't no turning back
You got me high on your tipsy smile and your hips all swingin'
We start spinnin', spinnin', spinnin'
Woah oo oh oo oh oo oh oh oh
Woah oo oh oo oh oo oh oh oh
Well I take the first step
Praying that I don't trip
Up on my words just think of something smart to say
Take a deep breath
Even though I'm scared to death
I don't care 'cause I just gotta know your name
It's a Friday night like any other
You walk in I stare and I stutter
Every single time you look at me
I need a fix, a true companion
Jimmy Beam or old Jack Daniels
Something strong to stop these shaking knees
Drinking up my courage
Whiskey for my nerves
You got me drunk on your short summer dress ballroom ballerina
I'm gonna need a-
‘Nother shot of glory
Ain't no turning back
You got me high on your tipsy smile and your hips all swingin'
We start spinnin', spinnin', spinnin'
Woah oo oh oo oh oo oh oh oh
Woah oo oh oo oh oo oh oh oh
Woah oo oh oo oh oo oh oh oh
Woah oo oh oo oh oo oh oh oh
Drinking up my courage
Whiskey for my nerves
You got me drunk on your short summer dress ballroom ballerina
I'm gonna needa
‘Nother shot of glory
Ain't no turning back
You got me high on your tipsy smile and your hips all swingin'
We start spinnin'
Drinking up my courage
Whiskey for my nerves
You got me drunk on your short summer dress ballroom ballerina
I'm gonna needa
‘Nother shot of glory
Ain't no turning back
You got me high on your tipsy smile and your hips all swingin'
We start spinnin', spinnin', spinnin'
