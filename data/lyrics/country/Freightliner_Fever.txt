I drive a big freightliner an' I made my last payment today
An' I drive to all points outta New York City to LA
Well, the little woman smiles when I pack up to leave her
I'll soon be back, but I just got the fever
She's a believer
I got the freightliner fever
There's a railroad a-runnin' by a highway out in Santa Fe
An' I passed an old freight train makin' his run the other day
Merle Haggard said to his fireman, so pale:
He's blowin' the freight train off of the rails
He got the fever
He got the freightliner fever
Well, Pierce said to Red, what you carryin' in that cigarette
Pack?
I said: "I got my second driver an' he's gonna drive her all
The way back."
It's a big black pill, so round an' round
The driver's call it west coast turnaround
It's for the fever
The ol' freightliner fever
Instrumental break
Well, I passed Dave Dudley up in Pittsburg, Pensylvania
An' I passed Del Reeves in Shreeveport, Louisianna
Dick Curtis got hung up on a hill in Maine
I pulled him over with my forty-foot chain
He got the fever, Fever
He got the freightliner fever
I mean I passed everything from a Jimmy to a Greyhound bus
I'm gonna spend a few days on the west coast at the end of my run
An old giddy-up, go an' a little bit of luck
Gonna pass Red Simpson and his runaway truck
He got the fever, Fever
He got the freightliner fever
Well, Pierce said to Red, what you carryin' in that cigarette
Pack?
I said: "I got my second driver an' he's gonna drive her all
The way back."
It's a big black pill, so long an' so round
To a driver, it's a west coast turnaround
It's for the fever. Fever
That ol' freightliner fever
Yeah, out on this road you pass a lot of them old contry boys
I seen Carl Smith an' Charley Pride
Ernest Tubbs, Bill Monroe
Conway Twitty, Waylon Jennings
See Dave Dudley, George Jones
Porter Wagoner, Bill Anderson
Faron Young, Stonewall Jackson
Roy Accuff...
