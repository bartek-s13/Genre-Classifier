A lonely spot, I know where no man will go
Where the shadows have all the room
I was ridin' free on the old SP
Humming a southern tune
When a man came along made me hush my song
Kicked me off, way out there
As she pulled out of sight I turned to the right
A left and everywhere
But all I could see was a cactus tree
And a prairie dog playing there
I watched the prairie dog feed on the tumbleweed
That's his home, way out there
So I threw down my load in the desert road
Rested my weary legs too
I watched the sinking sun, make the tall shadows run
Out across that barren plain
Then I hummed a tune to the risin' moon
He gets lonesome way out there
So I closed my eyes to the starlit skies
And lost myself in dreams
I dreamed the desert sand was a milk and honey land
Then I awoke with a start
There the train comin' back on that one way track
Gonna take me away from here
As she was passin' by, I caught her on the fly
I climbed in an open door
Then I turned around to that desert ground
Saw the spot I would see no more
As I was ridin' away
I heard the pale moon say
Farewell pal
It sure gets lonesome here
