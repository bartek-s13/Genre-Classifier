I don't want your lonely mansion with a tear in every room
I just want the love you promised beneath the halo'd moon
But you think I should be happy with your money and your name
And pretend that I don't notice while you play your cheatin' games
Silver threads and golden needles can't patch up this heart of mine
And I'll never drown my sorrow in the warm glow of your wine
You can't buy my love with money for I never was that kind
Silver threads and golden needles can't patch up this heart of mine
I grew up in in faded gingham where love is a sacred thing
You grew up in silk and satin where love is a passin' game
I know now you never loved me and I know I was a fool
To think your pride would let you live by the golden rule
Silver threads and golden needles can't patch up this heart of mine
And I'll never drown my sorrow in the warm glow of your wine
You can't buy my love with money for I never was that kind
Silver threads and golden needles can't patch up this heart of mine
