There are days...
Where her name bounces 'round in my head like a pinball in a coffee can
There are nights...
When the slightest little thing can make her memory scream through like an ambulance
There’s so many situations, a million little triggers
I go from moving on to man I miss her

And it hits me like a black smoke billowing, midnight whistlin' runaway train
Hits me like a white foam hurricane barrelling wave after crashing wave
When her memory gets the best of me, it'll really knock me down a step
But more and more it happens less and less

Finally stopped...
Trying to watch our old highlight reel in my mind when I fall asleep
Not afraid...
Of what I’d say if I saw her out some night and she came up to me
I'm not all the way better just better than I've been
It's not all the time now just every now and then

And it hits me like a black smoke billowing, midnight whistlin' runaway train
Hits me like a white foam hurricane barrelling wave after crashing wave
When her memory gets the best of me, it'll really knock me down a step
But more and more it happens less and less

Oh, less and less
When her memory gets the best of me, it'll really knock me down a step
But more and more it happens...
More and more, it happens
More and more, it happens
Less and less
Mmm, less and less
Ooh, less and less
