Girl, their playing our song, put your martini down, look around
Whole room is watching as they think I'm out of my league, just a farmboy in jeans
With a girl like you, in her downtown scene
If you’re west L.A I'd be an Arizona dust town
We don’t belong in the same zipcode
I feel like Jesse James when I'm around your crowd
Once we hit the floor

We're gonna make a scene like in a Quentin Tarantino
We're gonna light it up just like they do down there in Rio
When we get together girl, we're kinda like a freakshow
Beautiful Freakshow

Girl, you know my club
It's a roadside shack, the other side of the tracks
Your mama wants you back over there no more
So I’m crashing your scene, yeah I’m no Jay Z
But I can hold my own on this 8 count floor

Like Greta Garbo and Katherine Hepburn
Want to make you my Hollywood queen
But you and me are kind of like a spaghetti western
No one takes us seriously
So
We're gonna make a scene like in a Quentin Tarantino
We're gonna light it up just like they do down there in Rio
When we get together girl, we're kinda like a freakshow

Freaky-freakity-freakshow
Hillbilly on the dance floor
Boy you got some mojo
Bringing it back
I like them wearing camo
No boy toy with the Lambo
I’m little honey butter melting in your hands

We're gonna make a scene like in a Quentin Tarantino
We're gonna light it up just like they do down there in Rio
When we get together girl, we're kinda like a freakshow

Freaky-freakity-freakshow
Hillbilly on the dance floor
Boy you got some mojo
Bringing it back
I like them wearing camo
No boy toy with the Lambo
I’m little honey butter melting in your hands (your hands)
You and I
What a beautiful freakshow
You and I
What a beautiful freakshow
If you’re west L.A I'd be an Arizona dust town
We don’t belong in the same zipcode
I feel like Jesse James when I'm around your crowd
What a beautiful freakshow
