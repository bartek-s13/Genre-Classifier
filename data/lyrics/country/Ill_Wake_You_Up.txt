I spent the day just missing you remembering your touch
Counting all the reasons why I love you oh so much
In my thoughts you're always with me, every hour, every day
And if I could be with you right now here's what I'd love to say
I'll wake you up, when I get home
I know you won't care what time it is
'Cause I've been gone, so very long
And honey I've got so much love to give
You know our bed is big and lonesome
When your sleeping all alone
I'm your man and you're my woman
I'll wake you up, when I get home
There's a nightlight in the bedroom you left it on so I could see
When I turn the sheets back you'll be waiting there for me
I dream each night when we're apart I'm making love to you
Now I'll wake you up, and hold you close, and make our dreams come true
I'll wake you up, when I get home
I know you won't care what time it is
'Cause I've been gone, so very long
And honey I've got so much love to give
You know our bed is big and lonesome
When your sleeping all alone
I'm your man and you're my woman
I'll wake you up, when I get home
