Yesterday (Ooh, ooh)
We finally said those things we can't unsay (Ooh, ooh)
Through the blinds, I watched you speed away (Ooh, ooh)
It might sounds crazy

But I ever thought it'd feel so good
Saying goodbye, wouldn't stop you even if I could

Yeah, my heart didn't break
When I broke into that old bottle of fancy champagne
I've been saving for the perfect time
You can't rain on my parade
Got my freedom, gonna celebrate
When you left, I was so damn ready
No tears fell, just confetti, ah-woo
No tears fell, just confetti, ah-woo

I see it now (Ooh, ooh)
How you'd come home and kick the party out (Ooh, ooh)
Just like my dreams, you'd turn the music down (Ooh, ooh)
Now I'm singin' loud

And I never thought it'd sound so good
Saying goodbye, even better than I thought it would

Yeah, my heart didn't break
When I broke into that old bottle of fancy champagne
I've been saving for the perfect time
You can't rain on my parade
Got my freedom, gonna celebrate
When you left, I was so damn ready
No tears fell, just confetti, ah-woo
No tears fell, just confetti, ah-woo

The minute you walked out the door
There was a rainbow all over the floor
It's like Mardi Gras under my roof
Don't need a mop, I'm usin' a broom

Yeah, my heart didn't break
When I broke into that old bottle of fancy champagne
I've been saving for the perfect time
You can't rain on my parade
Got my freedom, gonna celebrate
When you left, I was so damn ready
No tears fell, just confetti, ah-woo, ooh, ooh
No tears fell, just confetti, ah-woo, ooh, ooh

(Ah-woo, ooh, ooh) When you left, it was so damn pretty
(Ah-woo, ooh, ooh)
