My little Grace, my little Elijah, my Zack
I don't know about you but I want peace
Hmm, what a concept, sweet peace
Hey kids turn off the TV
No, I don't wanna watch the evening news
So come on over here and sit down next to me
And let your momma look at you and you and you
And your beautiful faces
That I wanna keep safe as
Long as I can, I'm telling you right now
There's gonna be peace in this house
There's gonna be peace in this house
Gonna be some tender talkin' and some sweet little nothings
That add up to the somethings we can live without
There's gonna be peace in this house
Some belief in this house
And every good thing that ever happens
Happens from the inside out, I'm telling you now
There's gonna be peace in this house
Did I tell you today that I love you?
You're the reasons for everything I do
And sometimes I think the only hope for this world
Is the love in you, and you and you
So let's try to be patient and let's all play nice
'Cause everybody's gonna get
Get a little slice of this pie
There's gonna be peace in this house
There's gonna be peace in this house
Gonna be some tender talkin' and some sweet little nothings
That add up to the somethings we can live without
There's gonna be peace in this house
Some belief in this house
And every good thing that ever happens
Starts from the inside out, I'm telling you now
There's gonna be peace in this house
Are you listening?
Sweet peace
And every good thing that ever happens
Starts from the inside out, I'm telling you now
There's gonna be peace in this house
Amen
