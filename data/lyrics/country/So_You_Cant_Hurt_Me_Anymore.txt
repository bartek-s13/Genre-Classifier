It's getting hard to look me in the eyes
The sad truth is mirrors never lie
After all the pain you put me through
I always kept on running back to you
There was a time we were the best of friends
You had my back through the thick and thin
But now I realize the bitter truth
All I've got is everything to lose

It's time to go
Our separate ways
Been going through hell
From all the hell we raise
There comes a day
To turn the page
So tonight I'm pouring you out on the floor
So you can't hurt me anymore
Since you left we've been hand and hand
Nowadays I don't recognize the man
You know I thought she got the best of me
But you're the one who put me on my knees

It's time to go
Our separate ways
Been going through hell
From all the hell we raise
There comes a day
To turn the page
So tonight I'm pouring you out on the floor
So you can't hurt me anymore

It's time to go
Our separate ways
Been going through hell
From all the hell we raise
There comes a day
To turn the page
So tonight I'm pouring you out on the floor
So you can't hurt me anymore
You can't hurt me ... anymore
