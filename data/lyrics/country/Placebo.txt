Every time I fall
I just try and convince myself it's the real thing
But that ain't it at all
I never learn my lesson
Looks can be deceiving

The mind
Yeah, the mind is a powerful thing
But the heart is a whole lot smarter than you think
No, I'm not over you

Girl, you've got me love sick from your loving
Need me something for a remedy
Girl, you've got me dying but I'm hiding it
From another laying next to me
Can't help it that every time I think where did we go
Baby, it takes me right back to zero
This ain't love, it's just a placebo

Living with that thought
Is a bitter sugar pill for me to swallow
But it's all I got
The only thing that'll get me to tomorrow
The mind, yeah the mind is a powerful thing
But the heart is a whole lot smarter than you think
No, I'm not over you

Girl, you've got me love sick from your loving
Need me something for a remedy
Girl, you've got me dying but I'm hiding it
From another laying next to me
Can't help it that every time I think where did we go
Baby, it takes me right back to zero
This ain't love, it's just a placebo

It might feel so
But it ain't though
It's just a placebo
It might feel so
But it ain't though
It's just a placebo

Girl, you've got me love sick from your loving
Need me something for a remedy
Girl, you've got me dying but I'm hiding it
From another laying next to me
Can't help it that every time I think where did we go
Baby, it takes me right back to zero
This ain't love, it's just a placebo
Every time I fall
I just try and convince myself it's the real thing
That ain't it at all
