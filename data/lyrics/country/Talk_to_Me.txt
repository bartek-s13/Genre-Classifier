You know what it is
Hah

Girl, it don't matter what you sayin'
You know it all sounds good
Swear I would listen to you all day
Baby, if I could, alright

It ain't a kind of conversation, yeah
Whether you're happy or mad
I kinda like it when we argue
Just to hear your talkin' back

I love it when you talk to me, talk to me, talk to me
A little Carolina and some Tennessee
Makin' every word sound so sweet
Girl, I wanna hear you talk to me
Baby, won't you talk to me, talk to me, talk to me?
I'm never getting tired of listening
You make every word sound so sweet
Girl, I wanna hear you talk to me
Feeling like I'm kind of helpless
There ain't a thing I can do
All you gotta do is whisper
I can't say no to you (Woo)

I love it when you talk to me, talk to me, talk to me
A little Carolina and some Tennessee
Makin' every word sound so sweet
Girl, I wanna hear you talk to me
Baby, won't you talk to me, talk to me, talk to me?
I'm never getting tired of listening
You make every word sound so sweet
Girl, I wanna hear you talk to me

Baby, keep talkin', keep talkin'
Whisper up in my ear
Baby, keep talkin', keep talkin'
It's the only thing I wanna hear

I love it when you talk to me, talk to me, talk to me
A little Carolina and some Tennessee
Makin' every word sound so sweet
Girl, I wanna hear you talk to me (Hah)
Baby, won't you talk to me, talk to me, talk to me?
I'm never getting tired of listening
You make every word sound so sweet
Girl, I wanna hear you talk to me (Hey, yeah)
Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me (Won't you talk to me, baby?)
A little Carolina and some Tennessee
You make every word sound so sweet
Girl, I wanna hear you talk to me (Hah)
Girl, I wanna hear you talk to me
I wanna hear you talk to me
