What you gonna do when I'm coming home to you will you hold me real tight
I hope your only plan is to be my only man all night
Lets kick it back baby stop the crazy get lazy and take it real slow
Hide under the covers sexy lover make me shudder
Turn the music down low
You got me wrapped up you got me wrapped up good
I feel the fire
You got my heart baby just like I knew you would
You've taken me higher
Your love is better than the weather out in Hollywood
You got me wrapped up good
Wrapped up good
Tell me this is going where I hope this is going boy don't let me down
I can see forever when we're laying here together and there's no-one around
Whisper in my ear tell me what I wanna hear we got nothing to hide
Give me what I want cos the fun's just begun and we've got all night
You got me wrapped up you got me wrapped up good
I feel the fire
You got my heart baby just like I knew you would
You've taken me higher
Your love is better than the weather out in Hollywood
You got me wrapped up good
Wrapped up good
You got me wrapped up you got me wrapped up good
I feel the fire
You got my heart baby just like I knew you would
You've taken me higher
Your love is better than the weather out in Hollywood
It took one look and I was hooked and now it's understood
You got me wrapped up good
Wrapped up good
Wrapped up good
Wrapped up good
