I'm tired of the radio
Same old lyrics, smoke shows
You're so country, we all know
Tailgates and back roads
Same shit, different day
Ain't nothin' ever gon' change
As long as you know that you are just

Still just a bitch in my book

Hand-wired, plugged straight in
With the Les Paul
Calloused-over fingertips
Rock and roll gets to us all
Tell me what's your draw
Out in Nijmegen, Netherlands
You're stuck in a bubble, won't make it

Still just a bitch in my book
Still just a bitch in my book


"Where y'all playing?" Wait a minute
Same ol' strudel, circuit spinnin'
Come outside The Continental
Manchester girls say it's mental
I don't know what it is
I'm just trying to express myself
As long as you know that you are just
Still— Woo, bitch!

Still just a bitch in my book
Still just a bitch in my book
Still just a bitch in my book
