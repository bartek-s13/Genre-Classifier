God bless America again
You must know the trouble that she's in
Wash her pretty face, dry her eyes and then
God bless America again
You know, I wish God would bless America again
Like He did, way back there when it all began, He blessed her then
And we sort of took it for granted and didn't ask again
So let's just kinda' hold her hand now that's all
In case she stumbles, let's don't let her fall
God bless America again
You must know the trouble that she's in
Wash her pretty face, dry her eyes and then
God bless America again
I don't understand everything I read and hear
About what's wrong with America
When you don't have a lot of book learnin'
There's many things you don't understand
But I know this much, she's like a mother to me
And I love her with all my heart
And let me tell you this sir, everything I am
Or ever hope to be, I owe to her
God bless America again
You must know the trouble that she's in
Wash her pretty face, dry her eyes and then
God bless America again
Oh, yes, God bless America again
