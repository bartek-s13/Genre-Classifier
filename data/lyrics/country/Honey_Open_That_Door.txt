Honey, Honey
Honey won't you open that door
This is your sweet daddy don't you love me no more?
It's cold outside let me sleep on the floor
Honey won't you open that door
I honky-tonked around Dallas
Got in a poker game
Somebody must've been a-cheatin'
I lost everything but my name
Well I walked halfway to memphis
Finally got back home
I'd have been better off where i was
'cause here's where things went wrong
Honey, Honey
Honey won't you open that door
This is your sweet daddy don't you love me no more?
It's cold outside let me sleep on the floor
Honey won't you open that door
I went downtown to see 'ol bob
Thought he was my friend
The landlord said that bob's not here
"The Police done hauled him in!"
I ran right back to little honey's house
I got me a rockin' chair
"now honey if you don't open that door
I'm gonna rock on away from here"
Honey, Honey
Honey won't you open that door
This is your sweet daddy don't you love me no more?
It's cold outside let me sleep on the floor
Honey won't you open that door
Honey (Honey)
Honey (Honey)
Honey (Honey)
Honey (Honey)
Honey won't you open that door?
