Daddy ran around but he never ran away
Mama said that she'd forgive but it turns out that she can't
She fell into the arms of another
The weight of the lie just seemed to crush her
Now daddy paces and mama cries
For all the years of getting left behind

When the walls come down
Crumble in the dust
That's when you find out
Sometimes love just ain't enough
To keep the devil out
Of that picture perfect house
'Cause there's nowhere for secrets to hide
When the walls come down

Sister's got some demons that she's always tryna fight
Swear she's got control and so they trust that she'll be fine
'Cause no one wants to talk about her
Daily diet of pills and powder
But think it's bliss to just stay blind
But one day they'll open their eyes

When the walls come down
Crumble in the dust
That's when you find out
Sometimes love just ain't enough
To keep the devil out
Of that picture perfect house
'Cause there's nowhere for secrets to hide
When the walls come down

Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh
When the walls come down

Brick by brick, room by room
'Til there's nothing left but the truth

When the walls come down
Crumble in the dust
That's when you find out
Sometimes love just ain't enough
To keep the devil out
Of that picture perfect house
'Cause there's nowhere for secrets to hide
When the walls come down

Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh
When the walls come down
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh
When the walls come down
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh
