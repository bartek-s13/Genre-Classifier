Love the taste of a cold beer after work on a Friday
I love to turn it up and burn a bar down with the boys, yeah
I love the sound of four wheels southbound on the highway
But there ain't nothing that I love more than
The sweet sound of your voice

'Cause when it comes to loving you
Yeah all my walls fall down
Your touch in the dark
Lights a fire in my heart
That can't be put out
I swear the world stays still
And the stars shine blue
The angels start singing
A song I believe in
When it comes to loving you

Love the thought of watching college football with my grandad
I love to hear the rain beating on the roof of an old red barn
I love the way Ray Charles sings about Georgia
But there ain't nothing like Sunday mornings
When you're lying in my arms

'Cause when it comes to loving you
Yeah all my walls fall down
Your touch in the dark
Lights a fire in my heart
That can't be put out
I swear the world stays still
And the stars shine blue
The angels start singing
A song I believe in
When it comes to loving you, oh
When it comes to loving you
Yeah all my walls fall down
Your touch in the dark
Lights a fire in my heart
That can't be put out
I swear the world stays still
Yeah the stars shine blue
The angels start singing
A song I believe in
When it comes to loving you
The angels start singing
A song I believe in
When it comes to loving you
