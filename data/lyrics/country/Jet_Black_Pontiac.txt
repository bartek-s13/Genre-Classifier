I drove through Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi
Only one thing still hits me like it hits me
It's you, baby
Shotgun seating with you, baby
I've seen some pretty faces, everywhere all kinds of places
But stealin' that car was the time of my life
With you, baby
In that ol' Firebird with you, baby
Bet your daddy wants to kill me now
Baby, let's go back to that
Jet Black Pontiac
Hometown, 18, Saturday nights
Find a place off the map
Tall grass, trespass
Crossing every single line
Summertime hazy, borderline crazy
Teenage hearts on fire
Baby, let's go back to that
Jet Black Pontiac

Jet Black Pontiac
I bet that mix-tape's still scratched up on the floor board
I bet those windows don't fog up like they did before
With you, baby
Oh, with you baby
Wherever you are tonight
Baby, let's go back to that
Jet Black Pontiac
Hometown, 18, Saturday nights
Find a place off the map
Tall grass, trespass
Crossing every single line
Summertime hazy, borderline crazy
Teenage hearts on fire
Baby, let's go back to that

Yeah, oh
I drove through Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi
Baby, let's go back to that
Jet Black Pontiac
Hometown, 18, Saturday nights
Find a place off the map
Tall grass, trespass
Crossing every single line
Summertime hazy, borderline crazy
Teenage hearts on fire
Baby, let's go back to that
