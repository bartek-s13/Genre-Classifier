You have time for the gay affair
Time for people you know don't care
But you don't, you don't have time for me
You have time for the things at hand
And time for things you know won't stand
But you don't, no you don't have time for me
You're turning away from everything we knew
Then have you stopped to think about
What you're turning to and into
You have time for the likes of town
Time for those who will let you down
But you don't, oh you don't have time for me
