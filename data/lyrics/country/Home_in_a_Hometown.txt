Ain't nothing but a cigarette, scratch-off, stop on your way to somewhere
Only thing higher than the corn are steeples and the price of gas
Only got one stoplight, one diner
Where a few good old timers
Still living in their glory days (Glory days)
It's just Main Street and the court house
It ain't much to talk about
But we make the most of this place

We put the back in the road when we pull off the highway
The score on the board on a November Friday
The "hey, how you been?" when you ain't been around
Home in a hometown
We put the punch in the clock 'cause that's just what we do
Put cold on the beer when the work week's through
Put the raise of my pride in a little white house
And my home in a hometown

Put the fire in the field and the country on the radio station
We put our tails on gates, fill 'em up when our cup needs raising, yeah
A bunch of ball caps and blue jeans, hey
Nah, it really ain't a new thing
We put the back in the road when we pull off the highway
The score on the board on a November Friday
The "hey, how you been?" when you ain't been around
Home in a hometown
We ut the punch in the clock 'cause that's just what we do
Put cold on the beer when the work week's through
Put the raise of my pride in a little white house
And my home in a hometown

You got your home team, your home boys
That drawl and the y'all in your your home voice
That down home girl, when it's said and done
Yeah, that's a home run

We put the back in the road when we pull off the highway
The score on the board on a November Friday
The "hey, how you been?" when you ain't been around, yeah
We put the punch in the clock 'cause that's just what we do
Put cold on the beer when the work week's through
Put the raise of my pride in a little white house
And my home in a hometown
Yeah, with a home in a hometown
