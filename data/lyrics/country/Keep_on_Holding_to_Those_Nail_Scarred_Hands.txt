Look up look up God is still on his throne and you are never left alone
Have faith in God he has never failed you yet
Just keep on holding to those nail scarred hands
There's strong and sure and you need never fear
He'll hold you secure so let him fill your heart with cheer
Keep faith in God he will never let you down
Just keep on holding to those nail scarred hands
Keep holding on no matter what may come your way
For soon your journey will be o'er
At home some day you will be so very glad
You kept on holding to those nail scarred hands
There's strong and sure...
I'm holding to those blessed nail scarred hands
