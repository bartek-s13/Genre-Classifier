Do you remember when we were younger
We were hometown back fence jumpers
Free as an endless summer
Whoa oh
Kings and Queens of make-believe
Didn't need no cash, didn't need no gasoline
So much faith we could walk on water

We were on top of the world
Shooting stars, lighting up the boulevard
Proud small town boys and girls
Wide open roads and unbroken hearts
If I had one wish, yeah
If I had one wish Oh
If I had one wish
We'd be together
Young forever

Young forever, oh yeah

Do you remember believing in magic
Taking a chance just cause we had it
Kind of crazy when we look back at it
Whoa oh
Oh and that first time feeling
That first time failing
Oh I remember everything

We were on top of the world
Shooting stars, lighting up the boulevard
Proud small town boys and girls
Wide open roads and unbroken hearts
If I had one wish, yeah
If I had one wish, oh
If I had one wish
We'd be together
Young forever

Young forever, oh yeah

We were on top of the world
Shooting stars, lighting up the boulevard
Proud small town boys and girls
Wide open roads and unbroken hearts
If I had one wish, yeah
If I had one wish, oh
If I had one wish
We'd be together
Young forever
If I had one wish, yeah
If I had one wish, oh
If I had one wish
We'd be together
Young forever

Do you remember when we were younger
So much faith we could walk on water
