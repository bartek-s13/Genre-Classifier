Ain't it true what they say
Every dog has his day
I never had mine
I guess it was time
Send me on down the line
One piece at a time
She got her way
I bet it made her day
Through me off to the side
Took me out for a ride
Kicked me down to the curb
Now for all that it's worth
I'm lookin' to find
One that's broken like mine
Chorus:
Broken like mine
Or some piece of mind
I'll be happy when I find
A love less unkind
Broken like mine
I wish I was in her shoes
With nothin' left to lose
Carry myself down
To the lonely side of town
Tell her just how I feel
I need something now that's real
Don't you tell me that love is blind
A heart ain't got that kind of time
Unless it's broken like mine
(Repeat Chorus)
(Repeat Chorus)
