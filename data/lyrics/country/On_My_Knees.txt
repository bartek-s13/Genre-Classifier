(Charlie Rich)
On my knees, I ask you please
Honey, let me love you
Let me kiss you like I used to
When we meet on the street
I want to love you
I want to kiss you like I used to
Well, you used to be my baby
Mmm, and I don't mean maybe
I need you to be my baby now
Honey, don't you hear me calling
Please help me, I'm falling
Can't we work the whole thing out
Somehow, somehow
Every day you're away
I want to love you
I want to kiss you like I used to
(Janie Fricke)
On your knees
You've asked me please
If you can love me
If you can kiss me like you used to
The next time we meet on the street
Honey, you can love me
You can kiss me like you used to
(Charlie Rich)
Well, you used to be my baby
Mmm, and I don't mean maybe
I need you to be my baby now
Honey, don't you hear me calling
Please help me, I'm falling
Can't we work the whole thing out
Somehow, somehow
On my knees, I ask you please
Log on to kill this message
Honey, let me love you
Let me kiss you like I used to
(Janie Fricke)
The next time we meet on the street
Honey, you can love me
You can kiss me like you used to
