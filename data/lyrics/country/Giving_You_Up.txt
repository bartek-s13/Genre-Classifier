Don’t you dare try and reappear after you already got me standing here
I can’t believe you would come at me looking for a little bit of sympathy
Like I wasn’t the one you left all alone crying looking like a hot mess
Don’t show your face ‘round here anymore honey this is something you better get through your head

'Cause I’m giving you up, just like I did them Marlboro Lights
And I’m giving you up, the same way I did the whiskey on ice
And it’s all so tough you turn me into a man I don’t even recognize
I’m giving you up, the same way you did me out in the moonlight

What the hell are you thinking coming round to visit
Completely uninvited messing with my brain again
Couldn’t give me the satisfaction of forgetting your existence show up when I thought I finally found the end
Don’t be coming over looking for a conversation
Dropping little hints that you want me back again
‘Cause I’m so sick and tired of the little lies you tell me
So here is all I’m saying baby better listen in

I’m giving you up just like I did them Marlboro Lights
And I’m giving you up the same way I did the whiskey on ice
And it’s all so tough you turn me into a man i don’t even recognize
I’m giving you up the same way you did me out in the moonlight
I’m letting go of all the things that held their grips on me with you being my first priority
‘Cause death isn’t worth the weight of your love no more
And i’m packing up leaving closing shop
There ain’t no room for you in this heart no more so I’m letting go

And I’m giving you up just like I did them Marlboro Lights
And I’m giving you up, the same way I did the whiskey on ice
And it’s oh so tough you turn me into a man I don’t even recognize
I’m giving you up the same way you did me out in the moonlight
Yeah I’m giving you up, yeah I’m giving you up, yeah I’m giving you up
