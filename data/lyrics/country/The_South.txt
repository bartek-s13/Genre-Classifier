Boots and buckles, red clay and sand
My point ain't subtle here, I'm a southern man
Where the beer seems colder and the women seem hotter
Where the world don't seem so damn modern
Where a good old boy like me still has a chance

Aw, this is where I was born and this is where I'll die
Yeah, this is where I was born and this is where I will die

It's all about the south
Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Carolina
Don't you wanna get down and dirty? 'Cause, Florida I'm thirsty
Hit me with your Tennessee whiskey and crank it up loud
Laid back, crazy old timer, sweet magnolia
Dive bars and diners, oh yeah
Oh, and even if you're up north
Come on down, come on down
Oh, it's all about the south
All about the south

From daddy's Don Williams to mama's Patsy Cline
We're walking after midnight singing Tulsa time
Where the beer seems colder and the women seem hotter
Where the world don't seem so damn modern
This is where I was born this is where I'll die, oh that's right
It's all about the south
Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Carolina
Don't you wanna get down and dirty? 'Cause, Florida I'm thirsty
Hit me with your Tennessee whiskey and crank it up loud
Laid back, crazy old timer, sweet magnolia
Dive bars and diners, oh yeah
And even if you're up north
Come on down, come on down
Oh, it's all about the south

This is where I was born and this is where I'll die
This is where I was born and this is where I'll die
This is where I was born and this is where I'll die
This is where I was born and this is where I will die

It's all about the south
Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Carolina
Don't you wanna get down and dirty? 'Cause, Florida I'm thirsty
Hit me with your Tennessee whiskey and crank it up loud
Laid back, crazy old timer, sweet magnolia
Dive bars and diners, oh yeah
And even if you're up north
Come on down, come on down
Oh, I Said, even if you're up north
Come on down, come on down
Oh, it's all about the south
This is where I was born and this is where I'll die
This is where I was born and this is where I'll die
This is where I was born and this is where I'll die
