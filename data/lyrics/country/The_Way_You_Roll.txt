Maybe it's the sun or that sun on you
I feel like burnin' up the afternoon
It's a summertime weekend
Are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin?
Find a spot on the beach where they'll never find us
Listenin' to Marley sing a little warm love
Worries, we don't need 'em
Breathe in a little freedom
You always got the good stuff

I like the way you roll, you roll, you roll barefoot in the sand
Yeah, I can be high-e-igh-e-igh just watchin' you dance
Yeah baby you're slow ride, alright, makin' me feel right
One little kiss and I'm stoned
A hundred precent homegrown
I like the way you roll, you roll, you roll

Lyin' on my shoulder, makein' shapes in the clouds
Straight to my head never wanna come down
It's love you're dealin', I'm gettin' lost in the feelin'
Yeah, you're my favorite kind of buzz

I like the way you roll, you roll, you roll barefoot in the sand
Yeah, I can be high-e-igh-e-igh just watchin' you dance
Yeah baby you're slow ride, alright, makin' me feel right
One little kiss and I'm stoned
A hundred precent homegrown
I like the way you roll, you roll, you roll
You can find me a little bit off the tracks
You know how to bring me to greener grass
With the gray and the rain all fade away
Like me up to a brighter day
So pass me a bit of that gypsy soul
Don't care where I am as long as you go
You make me feel everything's alright
You always know just what I like

I like the way you roll, you roll, you roll barefoot in the sand
Yeah, I can be high-e-igh-e-igh just watchin' you dance
Yeah baby you're slow ride, alright, makin' me feel right
One little kiss and I'm stoned
A hundred precent homegrown
I like the way you roll, you roll, you roll
I like the way you roll, you roll, you roll
