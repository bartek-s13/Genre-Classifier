I'm lonesome for someone, to kiss me goodnight
Just the way you used to do
My achin' heart needs someone, to shine love's light
For without you, I'll always be blue
If I don't have you, to help me along
I know I can never go right
Without you beside me, to show me the way
I'm lost, like a stranger in the night
Like a lonely dove that flies, from pine to pine
My heart can't be gay and light
Like sightless eyes, that will never see the sun
I'm lost, like a stranger in the night
There's no need for me, to even try
Nothin' will turn out right
When I lost your love, I lost the will to live
And I'm lost, like a stranger in the night
Like a broken heart, that's lost on life's sea
Tho I pray with all my might
I know I can't face, to - morrow alone
And I'm lost, like a stranger in the night
