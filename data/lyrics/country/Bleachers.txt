You're just a boy, I'm just a girl
On this playground of ups and downs in this whole world
Just wasting time on stereotypes
Let's cut this class and not go back for just one life

We're all a little bit of Hallelujah and Heathen
We all add up to something with our odds and our evens
From the never even gave a damn's to the overachievers
Yeah, you can stay up in the stands
And I'll be under the bleachers
B-L-E-A-C-H-E-R-S
B-L-E-A-C-H-E-R-S

Let's graduate from these hallways
Of MVP's and losing streaks, it's all the same
If I've learned a thing, it's Kings and Queens don't mean a thing
What I'm trying to say

We're all a little bit of Hallelujah and Heathen
We all add up to something with our odds and our evens
From the never even gave a damn's to the overachievers
Yeah, you can stay up in the stands
And I'll be under the bleachers
It takes all kinds of you's and all kinds of me's
We've got the spirit, yeah, you better believe
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
If you gotta call it something, call it fun
If you're feeling what you're all about
Make it loud
Hear me shout

We're all a little bit of Hallelujah and Heathen
We all add up to something with our odds and our evens
From the never even gave a damn's to the overachievers
Yeah, you can stay up in the stands
And I'll be under the bleachers
B-L-E-A-C-H-E-R-S
B-L-E-A-C-H-E-R-S
It takes all kinds of you's and all kinds of me's
