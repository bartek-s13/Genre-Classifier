To love someone more dearly ev'ry day
To help a wand'ring child to find his way
To ponder o'er a noble tho't and pray
And smile when evening falls
And smile when evening falls
This is my task
To follow truth as blind men long for light
To do my best from dawn of day till night
To keep my heart fit for His holy sight
And answer when He calls
And answer when He calls
This is my task
And then my Savior by and by to meet
When faith hath made her task on earth complete
And lay my trophies at the Master's feet
Within the jasper walls
Within the jasper walls
This crowns my task
