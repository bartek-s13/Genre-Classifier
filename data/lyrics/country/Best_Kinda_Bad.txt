She's a Tom Petty girl in a boy band world
Got a fast set of keys and a fake ID
And she's gone (she gone)
The boys are blowing up her phone
Well, she'll walk through the door and the whole crowd roars
She was here last night on the karaoke mic
Singing, free, free falling
She's a warm shot of whiskey with nothing to chase
She'll bum a cigarette and blow it in your face
She's the best kinda bad, the wrong kinda right
She's a Sunday morning and a Saturday night
She's a "Hey boy, buy me a beer"
Oh, she'll take you by the hand, say, "Come on, let's go"
But she's nowhere round when the morning lights show
She's the best night I've ever had
Man she's the best kinda bad
Man she's the best kinda bad
Oh, just like a song, I keep singing along
I've hit rewind in my mind a hundred times to her smile
'Cause it went on for a country mile
No I can't shake the vision of us hugging and a-kissing
Now I'm picking up my phone calling everyone I know to tell her
Please, please call me, yeah
And I know she's on some other guy's arm tonight
But she won't leave her number or say goodbye
'Cause she's the best kinda bad, the wrong kinda right
She's a Sunday morning and a Saturday night
She's a "Hey boy, buy me a beer"
Oh, she'll take you by the hand, say, "Come on, let's go"
But she's nowhere round when the morning lights show
She's the best night I've ever had
Man she's the best kinda bad
Yeah, she's the best kinda bad
She's as bad as killing a bottle of whiskey
Bad as my buddy's girl trying to kiss me
Oh, but once it hits my lips
Man it's so damn hard to quit
'Cause she's the best kinda bad, the wrong kinda right
She's a Sunday morning and a Saturday night
She's a "Hey boy, buy me a beer"
(Man, I can't believe I fell for that)
Oh, she'll take you by the hand, say, "Come on, let's go"
But she's nowhere round when the morning lights show
She's the best night I've ever had
Man she's the best kinda bad
She's the best kinda bad, the wrong kinda right
Oh she's a Sunday morning and a Saturday night
She's a "Hey boy, buy me a beer", yeah, yeah
Oh, she'll take you by the hand, say, "Come on, let's go"
But she's nowhere round when the morning lights show
She's the best night I've ever had
Man she's the best kinda bad
Yeah, she's the best kinda bad, yeah
