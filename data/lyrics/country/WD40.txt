On the top shelf, by his toolbox
Tween' his wrenches and his Carhartt
Baseball cap, two things daddy had to have
He oiled the chain up on my old Schwinn
Held up the glovebox on his ‘86 TransAm
A couple quick fix tricks I learned from my old man

Thought that was all I needed 'til you came around
To loosen things up and hold them down
But the taste of your kiss on my lips
Aw, it’s workin' for me
Girl, you know your love can fix anything
Like duct tape and WD-40

If it's not broken, hold it together
Ain’t good as new but I’m a hell of a whole lot better
I was using all I have to try to patch things up

Thought that was all I needed 'til you came around
To loosen things up and hold them down
But the taste of your kiss on my lips
Aw, it’s workin' for me
Girl, you know your love can fix anything
Like duct tape and WD-40
