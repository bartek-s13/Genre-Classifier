Today I sat alone at the window
And I watched our little girl outside at play
With the little boy next door like so many times before
But something didn't seem quite right today
So I went outside to see what they were doing
And then the teardrops made my eyes grow dim
'Cause I heard him name a game
And I hung my head in shame
When I heard our little girl say to him
I don't want to play house
I know it can't be fun
I've watched mommy and daddy
And if that's the way it's done
I don't want to play house
It makes my mommy cry
'Cause when she played house
My daddy said goodbye
I don't want to play house
I know it can't be fun
I've watched mommy and daddy
And if that's the way it's done
I don't want to play house
It makes my mommy cry
'Cause when she played house
My daddy said goodbye
