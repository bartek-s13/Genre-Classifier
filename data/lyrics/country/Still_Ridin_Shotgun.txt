She gets mad when I don't pay the bills on time
Stayed up waitin' on me when I got home late last night
She bends for me but she ain't gonna break
The more she gives the more I take
Well anyone else would just walk away

But she's still ridin' shotgun
Yeah, she's still the one
That makes my heart beat fast, and has my back
Even when I think she's done
She's never tried to change me, knows who I am
Even when I'm wrong, no she don't give a damn
And whenever I need a smile she's always got one
Yeah, she's still ridin' shotgun

I get upset and then I take it all out on her
She does her best to forgive me for my worst
What she means to me she'll never know
The kind of love that don't always show
Well anybody else would just hit the road

But she's still ridin' shotgun
Yeah, she's still the one
That makes my heart beat fast, and has my back
Even when I think she's done
She's never tried to change me, knows who I am
Even when I'm wrong, no she don't give a damn
And whenever I need a smile she's always got one
Yeah, she's still ridin' shotgun

Well heaven only knows how I got this lucky
I've never seen an angel on earth, but she must be
Always lookin' out for me even when her feelin's stray to the backseat

But she's still ridin' shotgun
Yeah, she's still ridin' shotgun
Yeah, she's still ridin' shoutgun
Yeah, she's still the one
That makes my heart beat fast, and has my back
Even when I think she's done
She's never tried to change me, knows who I am
Even when I'm wrong, no she don't give a damn
And whenever I need a smile she's always got one
Yeah, she's still ridin' shotgun
Right next to me, how it's supposed to be
Yeah, she's still ridin' shotgun
