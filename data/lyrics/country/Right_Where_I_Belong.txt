Same old farm, same old dirt road drive
Same old creek I jumped a thousand times
Same old spot where I dropped this blanket on the ground
And get that same old kiss that I can't live without

Oh, I'm right where I belong
Got a good thing going on
Ain't no sweeter easy going
Ain't no softer summer breeze
Ain't no place I'd rather call home
Oh, I'm right where I belong

Same old neighbor, same old nod and wave
Same old houses need a coat of paint
Same old corner drug store that we all go to
Same old, "Don't be a stranger, y'all come back real soon."

Same old evening sun
Girl, you take my breath
In that almost see-through cotton dress
Same old, "Don't get no better than this."
Right where I belong
