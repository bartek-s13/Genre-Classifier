When he calls you
You don't have to answer right away
Make him wait
And when he small talks
Before he asks you on a date
Make him wait
When his Pontiac's in the driveway
And his eyes are midnight blue
Take a deep breath
Do the opposite of what you wanna do

Make him wait
By the phone
At the door to meet your dad
Before the first kiss, he's gotta hold your hand
You can't get it back when you give yourself away
A boy's gonna run but a real man's gonna stay
Girl, make him wait
Make him wait

When he says that
It'd be easier if you just stay the night
Make him wait
You're gonna wanna
And you're thinkin you just might
But make him wait

Make him wait
By the phone
At the door to meet your dad
Before the first kiss, he's gotta hold your hand
You can't get it back when you give yourself away
A boy's gonna run but a real man's gonna stay
Girl, make him wait
Make him wait

They told me love is worth the weight in gold
Like that ring on your hand
So when you find the one
The staying kind
Then he won't mind

If you make him wait
In his tux
Cello sings you down the aisle
Walk slow, take your time
While your daddy cries and your mama smiles
When they're throwin rice into the air
And those tin cans roll away
And you look into his eyes
And realize it was worth the while
To make him wait
Make him wait
