Late to the party cause girl we're the party
You're the tequila and the salt and the lime
Doesn't matter wherever we're at girl
Whatever happens it's a hell of a time
We roll out, we get drunk, we get down
Baby I loo kind of stupid when I'm dancing with you
But you laugh and I like it, we're magic tonight
We don't mean to make 'em jealous but we do

Make our own sunshine, make our own love baby
Ain't nobody do it like we do us
We make our own music, bang our own drum baby
Ain't nobody do it like we do us
We go together like New Year's Eve
And cheap champagne, and you can pour it all on me
Ain't no better feeling it does what it does
Ain't nobody do it like we do us

Watching you smiling gets me smiling
Everything about you, everything about me just
Fits like a puzzle, I love your love girl
You can be the waves, baby I'll be the beach
I'm the word, you're my rhyme
Every note, every line
Goes together like a song that we got stuck on repeat
We're stumbling home 'cause it's three in the morning
But that ain't gonna stop you and me
Make our own sunshine, make our own love baby
Ain't nobody do it like we do us
We make our own music, bang our own drum baby
Ain't nobody do it like we do us
We go together like New Year's Eve
And cheap champagne, and you can pour it all on me
Ain't no better feeling it does what it does
Ain't nobody do it like we do us
We do us

Girl there ain't no taste like the taste on your tongue
Ain't nobody bring it like you bring it 'til it's done
Ain't nobody know you the way that my body knows you
Baby ain't nobody do it like we do

Make our own sunshine, make our own love baby
Ain't nobody do it like we do us
We make our own music, bang our own drum baby
Ain't nobody do it like we do us
We go together like New Year's Eve
And cheap champagne, and you can pour it all on me
Ain't no better feeling it does what it does
Ain't nobody do it like we do us
