My life was so simple when I was just living for me
Didn't know I was missing, drumming to my own beat
But if life is a song, what’s a song when there's no harmony?
Then you came along and you showed me how good it can be

When you love a girl
It will change everything, rock your whole world
When all of a sudden
She's all that you want and all that you need
It makes you so strong, makes you weak in the knees
When she smiles, yeah, you’d do anything
Lay down your life in the blink of an eye
'Cause no matter the cost
You know you'd walk through fire for her
When you love a girl

I ask myself now, how did I ever do this alone?
'Cause since I've been holding you
I never wanna let go 'cause I'm home
Yeah, without you, my heart is a half, it could never be whole
And I couldn't settle for less, baby, now that I know

When you love a girl
It will change everything, rock your whole world
When all of a sudden
She’s all that you want and all that you need
It makes you so strong, makes you weak in the knees
When she smiles, yeah, you’d do anything
Lay down your life in the blink of an eye
'Cause no matter the cost
You know you’d walk through fire for her
When you love a girl
Ten tiny fingers, ten tiny toes
Babe, ain't it crazy the way love can go?
She's got our hearts in the palm of her hand
I guess now we both understand

When you love a girl
It will change everything, rock your whole world
When all of a sudden
She's all that you want and all that you need
It makes you so strong, makes you weak in the knees
When she smiles, yeah, you’d do anything
Lay down your life in the blink of an eye
'Cause no matter the cost
You know you'd walk through fire for her
When you love a girl
When you love a girl
