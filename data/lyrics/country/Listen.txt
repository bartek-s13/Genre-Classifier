Listen, listen to the snow that's fallin'
Doesn't snow here that often, but it's coming down
Can you hear, the distant sound of the highway?
Don't they know that it's not safe, to be leaving now?

Some people go and some people stay
Nothing you can say will make 'em change

Baby just listen, listen to the words you're sayin'
Listen to the hearts you're breakin'
Think about the love you're wastin
Baby just listen, listen to the look on my face
In case the words don't make a difference
Think of what you're gonna be missin'

Baby just listen, listen to the friends that told you
Life was too hard to go through, when you're all alone
Can you still remember, I was your best defender?
Now you tell me you don't know whether you're better on your own

Oh you're gonna do what you're gonna do, there's nothing I can say to stop you
So baby just listen, listen to the words you're sayin'
Listen to the hearts you're breakin'
Think about the love you're wastin'
Oh baby just listen, listen to the look on my face
In case the words don't make a difference
Think of what you're gonna be missin'

Oh I know you want your freedom and I know that I'm the reason
But I never meant to tie you down
Yeah and U don't think I'm getting through with anything I said to you
So maybe i should shut my mouth

Baby just listen, hey
Baby just listen
Oh baby just listen, listen to the look on my face
In case the words don't make a difference
Think of what you're gonna be missin'
Oh baby just, listen
Hey, baby just listen
