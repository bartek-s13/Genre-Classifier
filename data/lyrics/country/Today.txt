When I'm sitting in traffic some afternoon
Or bored to death in some waiting room
I'm gonna close my eyes and picture you
Today

You keep brushing that hair back out of your eyes
It just keeps falling and so do I
Well I'm feeling like the luckiest man alive
Today

I don't know about tomorrow
But right now the whole world feels right
And the memory of a day like today
Could get you through the rest of your life

I know it won't always be like this
Life could change as quick as a kiss
It's not over yet and I already miss
Today

I don't know about tomorrow
But right now the whole world is right
And the memory of a day like today
Could get you through the rest of your life

And as the seasons change and time goes bye
When your hair is grey and so is mine
I know for sure that you're gonna be
Just as beautiful as you are to me
Today
Bring on tomorrow, I've got today
Bring on tomorrow, I've got today
Bring on tomorrow, right now the whole world is right
Bring on tomorrow

Because a memory of a day like today
Could get you through the rest of your life
