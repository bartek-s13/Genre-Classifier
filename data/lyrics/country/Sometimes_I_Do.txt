Sometimes i feel like drinking
Sometimes I do
That's when I get to thinking about you
And when I'm thinking about you
And all we've been through
Sometimes I feel like crying
And sometimes I do
I keep wishing you'd start missing me
And wanna come back home
Maybe this time out
We could find out just where we went wrong
But if you're happy here without me
Then I'm happy too
Lord I tried
Not to lie
Sometimes I do
I keep wishing you'd start missing me
And wanna come back home
Maybe this time out
We could find out just where we went wrong
But if you're happy here without me
Then I'm happy too
Lord I tried
Not to lie
Sometimes I do
Like when I say, "I don't need you"
Lord know I do
