Remember when we'd spend the whole night lovin
We just had to be together all the time
So much in love we didn't want for nothing
Back when I was yours and you were mine
Somehow we let it slip right through our fingers
Somewhere we left our love along the way
Now after all thre life we've lived between us
How can we have nothing more to say
Let's put aside the pain and all the sorrow
Stop talking bout the way things mighta been
If we'd only throw our hearts into tomorrow
Tonight we just might fall in love again
Remember how we lived on hopes and wishes
Remember when we lived for love alone
Just getting by on one another's kisses
Back before the sweetness turned to stone
(chorus)
Let's put aside the pain and all the sorrow
Stop talking bout the way things mighta been
If we'd only throw our hearts into tomorrow
Tonight we just might fall in love again
