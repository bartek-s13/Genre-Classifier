He plays guitar at a hotel bar
For out of towners and business men
He struts and sings to his drum machine
But he won't make it big at the Holiday Inn
But she thinks that he looks like Elvis
When he runs his fingers through that jet black hair
And sometimes she forgets an order
'Cause she's so struck by him that she stops and stares
They gotta love bigger than the Beatles
Wild and free like a Rolling Stone
They gotta love takes 'em higher than the Eagles
Ain't life such a sweet sweet song
Na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na yeah yeah yeah
She pours some drinks, loads up the sink
And dreams of being a movie star
Her mama said she'd knock 'em dead
But Hollywood hasn't called so far
But he thinks she's as pretty as a picture
When she wipes down tables in her apron strings
And sometimes he forgets a chorus
'Cause she's shining like a beauty on the silver screen
They gotta love bigger than the Beatles
Wild and free like a Rolling Stone
They gotta love takes 'em higher than the Eagles
Ain't life such a sweet sweet song
Na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na yeah yeah yeah
No you won't find their names on the walk of fame
But they ain't missing much
'Cause when the lights go down on tinsel town
All you need is love
They gotta love bigger than the Beatles
Wild and free like a Rolling Stone
They gotta love takes 'em higher than the Eagles
Ain't life such a sweet sweet song
Na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na yeah yeah yeah
