Raven is the color of her long, curly hair
Red is the dress that she knows how to wear
Bluest eyes I've ever seen - maybe just a touch of green
Oh, she could steal most any woman's man
This'd be a real good time to hold my hand
She walked up and said, "Hello, it's been awhile"
Don't think I didn't notice the nervous in your smile
Wasn't that long ago you were a whole lot more than friends
This would be a real good time to hold my hand
Don't let this moment linger
Now would be the time
To reach out with your fingers
And get 'em tangled up with mine
Let her know for sure
That I'm more than just a soft place to land
This'd be a real good time to hold my hand
If I'm your future and she's your past
If it's over with her and our love's gonna last
Don't let this moment linger
Now would be the time
To reach out with your fingers
And get 'em tangled up with mine
Let her know for sure
That I'm more than just a soft place to land
This would be a real good time
This would be a real good time
Oh, this'd be a real good time to hold my hand
