I’ve been travelin’ far and wide
Searchin’ for a comfort I could only find
In a kindred town filled with good company
Custom-built like a picket fence
Where the first one you meet is a trusted friend
And loves the alma mater
The glass is never half-empty
Lookin’ for a time-honored tradition
Where the memories are made
And the stories don’t change
A time-honored tradition
So pull up a chair and listen
To the legendary day
Well there are those who never wish
To be held accountable for a love like this
They just roll their eyes in pity
‘Cause they don’t get the family line
And I’ve been longing to see a place
Where the roots of my inheritance can be traced
And I walk with all the others
Rally, I will claim them mine
Lookin’ for a time-honored tradition
Where the memories are made
And the stories don’t change
A time-honored tradition
So pull up a chair and listen
To the legendary day
Lookin’ for a time-honored tradition
Where the memories are made
And the stories don’t change
A time-honored tradition
So pull up a chair and listen
I’m lookin’ for a time-honored tradition
Where the memories are made
And the stories don’t change
A time-honored tradition
So pull up a chair and listen
To the legendary day
