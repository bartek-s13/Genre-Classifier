Cardboard sign says yard sale
Real estate sign says sold
Family picnic table, holds all that it can hold
On the grass and on the sidewalk
Well, there must be half the town
Ain't it funny how a broken heart
Can bring the prices down?
Oh, they're sortin' through
What's left of you and me
Paying yard sale prices
For each golden memory
Oh, I never thought I'd ever live to see
The way they're sortin' through
What's left of you and me
You left two summer dresses
In the backyard on the line
Lady just brought them to me
Said she thinks they'll fit just fine
Well, there goes the baby's wagon
And the mirror from the hall
I better take just one last look
Before they take it all
Oh, they're sortin' through
What's left of you and me
Paying yard sale prices
For each golden memory
Oh, I never thought I'd ever live to see
The way they're sortin' through
What's left of you and me
Well, I wonder what you'd say
If you could see
The way they're sortin' through
What's left of you and me
