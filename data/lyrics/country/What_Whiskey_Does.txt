I'm gon' light one up and sit right here
I'm gon' drink this hole in the wall out of beer
And when that ice cold beer loses its buzz
I'm gonna let that whiskey do what whiskey does

Well, maybe it'll make me lose my mind
Well, maybe it'll help me forget this time
Well, maybe it'll put my fist through the wall
Make me pick up the phone and give you a call
Maybe it'll take me somewhere I've never been
Make the world stand still, and make the whole room spin
Maybe make me dance, make me cry
Hell, I don't know, but I know tonight

I'm gon' light one up and sit right here
I'm gonna drink this hole in the wall out of beer
And when that ice cold beer loses its buzz
I'm gonna let that whiskey do what whiskey does

Well maybe it'll buy this bar a round
Or turn my ass upside down
Maybe it'll make me a fly on the wall
Or stand me up ten feet tall
Maybe it'll take me to a better place
And put a smile back on my face
Maybe it'll make me hate myself
Or fall in love with somebody else
But I'm gon' light one up and sit right here
I'm gonna drink this hole in the wall out of beer
And when that ice cold beer loses its buzz
I'm gonna let that whiskey do what whiskey does

And maybe it'll talk me off the ledge I've been on lately
Maybe it'll heal me, maybe it'll kill me, yeah, maybe

But I'm gon' light one up and sit right here
And drink this hole in the wall out of beer
And when that ice cold beer loses its buzz
I'm gonna let that whiskey do what whiskey does

But sometimes I sit here just because
I wanna let that whiskey do what whiskey does
