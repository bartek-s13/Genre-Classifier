Oh, have you seen Miss Molly
Her cheeks are rosy red
Her lips are soft as satin
And they taste like ginger bread
Oh, Oh, Oh, me, oh, my Miss Molly I'm in love with you
Oh, me, oh, my Miss Molly won't you say you love me too
Now when Miss Molly's smilin'
The sun is dim a spell
And when she laughs
Her voice is like a little silver bell
Oh, Oh, Oh, me, oh, my Miss Molly I'm in love with you
Oh, me, oh, my Miss Molly won't you say you love me too
I'll trade my horse and saddle
Cow drivin' I'll re-sign
If only Miss Molly
Will say that she'll be mine
Oh, Oh, Oh, me, oh, my Miss Molly I'm in love with you
Oh, me, oh, my Miss Molly won't you say you love me too
Now listen dear Miss Molly
I've told you this before
And even though' I told you so
I'll tell you just once more
Oh, Oh, Oh, me, oh, my Miss Molly I'm in love with you
Oh, me, oh, my Miss Molly won't you say you love me too
