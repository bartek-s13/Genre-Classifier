You came into this world, in a blink of an eye
Well man how time really flies
You made me smile, and as a tear fell from my eye
You lit that room up little guy
It was the best day of my life
Now I'm a laugh with you, cry with you, let my love surround you
And I'm dance with you pray for you and wrap my arms around you when you cry
Little guy
Cause I'm gonna be the best dad that I can
I'll take you by those little hands
And when you stumbled, I'll pick you right up
I'll be your number one fan
And watch you grow into a man
Now I'm a laugh with you, cry with you, and let my love surround you
And I'm a dance with you pray for you and wrap my arms around you when you cry
Little guy
Your gonna grow older and wiser
And your gonna chase your dreams
And one day raise a family
And you'll know just what I mean
Son you mean the world to me
Now I'm a laugh with you, cry with you, let my love surround you
And I'm a dance with you pray for you and wrap my arms around you when you cry
Little guy
I'm so glad your mine
