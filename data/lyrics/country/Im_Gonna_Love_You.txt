Some go searching far and wide
And never end up satisfied
They scour the earth and come up short
Of everything they bargained for
They say there's something out there for everyone
Oh but fancy cars and shiny things
Never meant a thing to me
I ain't much on politics or war
Cause I just don't know what either's for
Life down here wouldn't make much sense without you
So I'm gonna love you
Right up to the end
I know where I'm going to be
Yeah right there beside you
Is how I'm gonna spend
This precious time given to me
I don't have a lot to prove
But I'm gonna love you
Some may find their pot of gold
Spend their days in dark and cold
Rain might leak upon my floors
But i can see the sky after it storms
And on the darkest days
Your light's still shining through
Yeah I'm gonna love you right up to the end
I know where I'm going to be
Yeah right there beside you
Is how I'm gonna spend
This precious time given to me
I might not have a lot to prove
But I'm gonna love you
Yeah I'm gonna love you
