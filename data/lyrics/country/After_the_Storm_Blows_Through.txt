You've been walking around with a dark cloud
Hanging over every step you take
Like the slightest breeze will knock you to your knees
Doing your best not to break
Wish I had the words to tell ya, but I got an umbrella
And I think it's big enough, for the both of us

I'll face that wind by your side
Even take on that rain, I don't mind
Or give you space or give you time
If you need me to
But I'll be here for you
After the storm blows through

You know, you and me, we've been thick as thieves
You get cut I feel the pain
We're stuck together, no matter what the weather
And that ain't gonna change
I don't know how long the hurt'll hold on
Or when the sun will shine again
So until then...

I'll face that wind by your side
Even take on that rain, I don't mind
Or give you space or give you time
If you need me to
But I'll be here for you
After the storm blows through
And your skies are blue again
And you're back to you again, my friend
I'll face that wind by your side
Even take on that rain, I don't mind
Or give you space or give you time
If you need me to
But I'll be here for you
After the storm blows through
