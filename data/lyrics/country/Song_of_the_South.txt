Song, Song of the south
Sweet potato pie and I shut my mouth
Gone, gone with the wind
There ain't no body looking back again
Cotton on roadside, cotton on the ditch
We all picked the cotton but we never got rich
Daddy was a veteran, a Southern Democrat
They oughta get rich man to vote like that
Singing:
Song song of the south
Sweet potato pie, and I shut my mouth
Gone gone with the wind
There ain't no body looking back again
Well somebody told us Wall Street fell
But we were so poor that we couldn't tell
The cotton was short, and the weeds was tall
But Mr. Roosevelt's a' gonna save us all
Well momma got sick, and daddy got down
The county got the farm, and we moved to town
Poppa got a job with the TVA
We bought a washing machine, and then a Chevrolet
Singing: Song song of the south
Sweet potato pie and I shut my mouth
Gone, gone with the wind
There ain't nobody looking back again
