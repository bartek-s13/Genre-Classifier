All this we've been together
Everyday a new adventure
Times, enough to last forever and a day
Our love was sometimes all we had
Through good times and through bad
I loved you all the way
All our days weren't bright and sunny
There are times we have no money
You could always find some funny thing to say
And looking back on where we've been
I'd do it all again
I loved you all the way
I loved you all the way
Every night, every night, every day
Times I thought I couldn't take it
Wond'rin' if we'd ever make it
You could hold me close and make it go away
And though I've said it all before
I never meant it more
I loved you all the way
I loved you all the way
