So many times I told you I was leaving
And so many times how I tried
But saying you're leaving so much easier
Than leaving and saying goodbye
'Cause every time I'd start to go
I wouldn't get ten feet
'Til I'd come running back
Like a runaway child whose afraid to cross the street
My mind might tell my lips to say that it's over
But my heart would only say, "That's a lie"

'Cause saying you're leaving so much easier
Than leaving and saying goodbye

One minute I'm all set to go
And then I change my mind
There's such a difference between leaving you
And leaving you behind
I'm always saying something about leaving
Oh, but something tells me I won't even try

'Cause saying you're leaving so much easier
Than leaving and saying goodbye
Than leaving and saying goodbye
