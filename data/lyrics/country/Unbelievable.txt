She's so kissable, huggable, lovable, unbelievable
She's a mouthful of anything and everything a man could want
She ain't typical, she's unpredictable, she's available, it's a miracle
How my heart stumbled into someone so kissable, huggable, lovable
Unbelievable
Up 'til now my life has been so lonely and boring
I never thought I would find someone so
Elegant, intelligent, heaven sent, all my money spent
I put a big down payment on that itty bitty diamond ring
She's so beautiful, it's indisputable, it's undeniable, she's
Got-to-havable
She's music to my ears, and makes my heart sing, so kissable
Huggable, lovable, unbelievable
There's so many things
I want to tell her
Like I love her
But every time I talk
I start to stutter
She's so elegant, intelligent, heaven sent, all my money spent
I put a big down payment on that itty bitty diamond ring
She's so beautiful, it's indisputable, it's undeniable, she's
Got-to-havable
She's music to my ears, and makes my heart sing, so kissable
Huggable, lovable, unbelievable
Kissable, huggable, lovable, unbelievable
Kissable, huggable, lovable, unbelievable
