Well, I miss College Station
Them boys were good to me
Well, I burned North Gate down
I been the life of the party
I seen that twelve man town
Through a tailgate sea

The road goes on
I can't stay long
I got sights to see

I raised hell in the panhandle
Lived young, wild, and free
Northern winds kicked my rear end
And got the best of me
Found myself stuck in Lubbock
Playin' my songs for free

But the road goes on
I can't stay long
I got sights to see
The miles I traveled down these roads
Still recall the heart I broke
Yes, runnin' away never got me over you
Because the truth
Sometimes this road gets lonesome
And I wonder how you been
I can't help but think you're probably
Somewhere better off with him
But if you ever hear my songs
And you still love me
Darlin', hurry home
We can't stay long
We got sights to see
I said, oh, oh
I said, oh, oh
Said, oh
