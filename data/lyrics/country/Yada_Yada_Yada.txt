I'm rollin' into your subdivision
I'm turnin' on that tunnel vision
Yeah the radio's on but I ain't even listenin'
'Cause baby I've got tunnel vision
All your girls are at home gettin' all dolled up
Callin', wonderin' if you're gonna roll
All my boys are like "there's a party goin' on"
Blowin' up my phone
Sayin' man let's go

Pop a top, raise a little hell
Drink another drop of liquor on the shelf
But it's all yada yada yada
Baby 'cause I got ya
Take that purse, drop it on the floor
'Cause you and me ain't got nowhere to go
All I need you got a lot of
Yada yada yada
Don't need the bright lights, no Jack, no coke
Just give me you and the way you move, baby that's all she wrote

Nah you didn't get dressed up for nothin'
I'm pretty sure we can think of somethin'
A little time with you is all I've been wantin'
Nah you didn't get dressed up for nothin'

Pop a top, raise a little hell
Drink another drop of liquor on the shelf
But it's all yada yada yada
Baby 'cause I got ya
Take that purse, drop it on the floor
'Cause you and me ain't got nowhere to go
All I need you got a lot of
Yada yada yada
Don't need the bright lights, no Jack, no coke
Just give me you and the way you move, baby that's all she wrote
