Checking my lipstick in your aviators
Like a couple of cool kids, the hit paraders
The cherry glow of your cigarette

Don’t tell me the world couldn’t handle
A good old-fashioned American scandal

Hold me baby, hold me like you ain’t mine to hold
Oh kiss me baby kiss me, like you don’t care who knows
Oh love me baby love me like Kennedy and Monroe

Lights are flashing, Main Street paparazzi
You got them lining up to watch you want me
Let’s one up the rumors

Hold me baby, hold me like you ain’t mine to hold
Oh kiss me baby kiss me, like you don’t care who knows
Oh love me baby love me like Kennedy and Monroe

Don’t tell me the world couldn’t handle
A good old-fashioned American scandal
Hold me baby, hold me like you ain’t mine to hold
Oh kiss me baby kiss me, like you don’t care who knows

Hold me baby, hold me like you ain’t mine to hold
Oh kiss me baby kiss me, like you don’t care who knows
Oh love me baby love me like Kennedy and Monroe

(Don’t tell me the world couldn’t handle) Kennedy and Monroe
(a good old-fashioned American scandal) Ooh like Kennedy and Monroe
(Don’t tell me the world couldn’t handle) Kennedy and Monroe
(a good old-fashioned American scandal)
Don’t tell me the world couldn’t handle a good old-fashioned American scandal
