There's a full moon over Tulsa
I hope that it's shining on you
The nights are getting cold in Cherokee County
There's a Blue Norther passing through
I remember green eyes and a ranchers daughter
But remember is all that I do
Losing you left a pretty good cowboy
With nothing to hold on to
Sundown came and I drove to town
And drank a drink or two
You're the reason God made Oklahoma
You're the reason God made Oklahoma
And I'm sure missing you, I'm sure missing you
Here the city lights out shine the moon
I was just now thinking of you
Sometimes when the wind blows you can see
The mountains and all the way to Malibu
Everyone's a star here in L.A. County
You ought to see the things that they do
All the cowboys down on the Sunset Strip
Wish that they could be like you
The Santa Monica Freeway
Sometimes makes a country girl blue
You're the reason God made Oklahoma
You're the reason God made Oklahoma
And I'm sure missing you
I work 10 hours on a John Deere tractor
Just thinking of you all day
I've got a calico cat and a two room flat
On a street in West L.A
You're the reason God made Oklahoma
You're the reason God made Oklahoma
And I'm sure missing you, I'm sure missing you
