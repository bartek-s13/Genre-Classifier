Gonna raise up a tall glass
Tonight as we look back
Back on all the life that we lived through
Yeah, the things that we drink to

Roads that we choose, friends that we make
Turns that we miss and the hearts that we break
The words that we say and the ones that we don't
Lines that we cross and the ones that we won't
Tears that we cried, the dreams that we dreamed
Stars that burnt out and the stars that we reached
The pictures we take, the stories they tell
And the moments we keep for ourselves

Gonna raise up a tall glass
Tonight as we look back
Back on all the life that we lived through
Yeah, the things that we drink to
Shed a little light on a memory
Kinda makes it feel like you're with me
I'm still a little lost here without you
Yeah, the things that we drink to

The hurt that we heal, the songs that we sing
The hope that we know tomorrow can bring
The battles we fight, the wars that we win
The pain that we been through
(Things that we drink to
Things that we drink to)

Gonna raise up a tall glass
Tonight as we look back
Back on all the life that we lived through
Yeah, the things that we drink to
We can wonder where all the time goes
But it don't change a thing though
All I'm tryna say is I miss you
Yeah, the things that we drink to
(Things that we drink to
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Things that we drink to)

All I'm tryna say is I miss you
Yeah, the things that we drink to
