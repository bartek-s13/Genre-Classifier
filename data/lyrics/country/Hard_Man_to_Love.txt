The phone call in the middle of the night, it never came G
She's been walkin' on pins and needles waitin' for the phone to ring
To put her mind at ease
The suns' comin' up and I'm comin' in
With another "I'm sorry, It won't happen again"
I can't understand why she never ran
When anybody in their right mind would
Yeah I'm a hard man to love
But thank God she does
Keep holdin' on, bein' strong
When "I'm sorry" just ain't enough
Soft as silk she stands
By her barbed wire man
She's never given up
I'm A hard man to love
There's a dog house rose that God knows I didn't send soon enough
Sittin' in the middle of a crippled kitchen table barely standing up from where I kicked it once
It ain't pretty enough to make up for me messin' up the only love a man could ever need
She shines forgiveness from her patient eyes
I don't see what they see in me
Yeah I'm a hard man to love
But thank God she does
Keep holdin' on, bein' strong
When "I'm sorry" just ain't enough
Soft as silk she stands
By her barbed wire man
She's never given up
I'm A hard man to love
But I found someone tough enough to love a man like me
In spite of the tears she's cried and the time she's tried so hard to love
This hard man to love
But thank God she does
Keep holdin' on, bein' strong
When "I'm sorry" just ain't enough
Soft as silk she stands
By her barbed wire man
She's never given up
I'm A hard man to love
No she's never given up
On this hard man to love
