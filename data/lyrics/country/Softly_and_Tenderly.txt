Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling
Calling for you and for me
See on the portals, He's waiting and watching
Watching for you and for me
Come home, come home
Ye who are weary come home
Earnestly, tenderly Jesus is calling
Calling, oh, sinner come home
Why should we tarry when Jesus is pleading?
Pleading for you and for me
Why should we linger and heed not His mercies?
Mercies for you and for me
Come home, come home
Ye who are weary come home
Earnestly, tenderly Jesus is calling
Calling, oh, sinner come home
Oh, for that wonderful love He has promised
Promised for you and for me
Though we have sinned, He has mercy and pardon
Pardon for you and for me
Come home, come home
Ye who are weary come home
Earnestly, tenderly Jesus is calling
Calling, oh, sinner come home
Calling, oh, sinner come home
