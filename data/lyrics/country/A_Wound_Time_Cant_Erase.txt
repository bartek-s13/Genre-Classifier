Have you found since you turned me down the one that you've been searching for
Are you glad that you made me sad for you know I vowed to love you ever more
What did you have in mind when you broke this heart of mine
And are you laughing in my face
Darling what can I do when you say we were through
You've left a wound time can't erase
Tell me dear are you satisfied to be foot loose and fancy free
Is it power you want for the things that you have done
What you've gained I guess I'll never see
What did you have in mind...
