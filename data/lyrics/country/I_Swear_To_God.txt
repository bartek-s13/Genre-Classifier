I only had a couple drinks last night
And few good hits from an end of a pipe
And I must admit, I had a few white lines
And I don't know what all happened
I woke up in the noon time light
With a poundin' head, shiner on my eye
And I don't know how and I don't why
But it feels like fierce abandon

Ah, working on a buildin' out'a hand-hewn brimstone
Workin' on a buildin' and I'm buildin' on it all alone
Well there ain't nobody in my room tonight
Goodnight honey, honey sleep tight
Ma I swear I'm doing alright
But when the evenin' comes around
I swear to God

Pay no mind to the words I say
Cause they ain't no count anyway
I been ramblin' around and led astray
By the paths that I been choosin'
Cuttin' paths like a forest fire
Pupils wider than backhoe tires
Throwin' my money on a funeral pyre
But it sure feels good abusin'
Ah, working on a buildin' out'a hand-hewn brimstone
Workin' on a buildin' and I'm buildin' on it all alone
Well there ain't nobody in my room tonight
Goodnight honey, honey sleep tight
Ma I swear I'm doing alright
But when the evenin' comes around
I swear to God

Bands too loud for their bible thumpin'
Feels too good to not count for somethin'
Big Sandy rock, Sludge River roll
Goddamn, fire in the hole
Look out baby, I'm bound to blow
I'm bound to blow a gasket
Damn good gig, good damn crowd
Good God, for cryin' out loud
Coming off stage I was mighty proud
Then I don't know what all happened

Ah, working on a buildin' out'a hand-hewn brimstone
Workin' on a buildin' and I'm buildin' on it all alone
Well there ain't nobody in my room tonight
Goodnight honey, honey sleep tight
Ma I swear I'm doing alright
But when the evenin' comes around
I swear to God
I swear to God
