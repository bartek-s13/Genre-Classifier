Make amends with that old friend
You swore you'd never never talk to again
Because you miss him
Call up your mom on the telephone
Talk a whole lot of nothing til the cows come home
And listen
Cross every T, dot most the I's
'Cause years grow wings and fly on by
And time slips through your fingers just like sand
Because everything you thought would last forever
Never lasts forever, like you plan
Don't let your night become another
So take life by the hands while you still can
Get your daddy to tell that same old joke
And laugh between the jack and coke
And hope one day you'll be half as funny
Count your blessings and your stars
It's in the air and who you are
It's about the wealth you give
It sure as hell ain't about the money
Because everything you thought would last forever
Never lasts forever like you plan
Don't let your night become another
So take life by the hands while you still can
You just imagine
Anything can happen if you live every moment like your last
Because everything you thought would last forever
Never lasts forever like you plan
Don't let your night become another
So take life by the hands while you still can
