On a winter night in Webb County, Texas
On the north bank of the mighty Rio Grande
I was watchin' the jungle fires a-burnin'
Across the border of a not-so-distant land
And the echoes of the church bells that were swingin'
Could be heard from Guadalupe Market Square
There was a girl down there on the south side of the river
She had feathers tied into her long black hair

And if I was I was white-crowned sparrow
Well, I would float upon the southern skies of blue
But I'm stuck inside the wheels of Laredo
Wishin' I was rollin' back to you

I put on my favorite jacket for Jamboozie
I painted up my eyes and wore my beads
There was a band playin' "To God Be the Glory"
There were people dancin' all around the street
There were barrels on the sidewalk that were burnin'
And a fortune-teller readin' people's hands
And I swear, I heard those church bells ringin'
'Cross the border of a not-so-distant land
Singing, if I was white-crowned sparrow
Well, I would float upon the southern skies of blue
But I'm stuck inside the wheels of Laredo
Wishin' I was rollin' back to you
And if I was I was white-crowned sparrow
Well, I would float upon the southern skies of blue
But I'm stuck inside the wheels of Laredo
Wishin' I was rollin' back to you

I'm stuck inside the wheels of Laredo
Wishin' I was rollin' back to you
Wish I was rollin' back, back to you
Wish I was rollin' back to you
Wish I was rollin' back to you
