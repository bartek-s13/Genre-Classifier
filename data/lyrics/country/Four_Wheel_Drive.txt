We was screaming through the valley
Where the Nishnabotna flows
Through the mud and crud and cornfields
Where the marijuana grows
Crossed the railroad tracks at Persia
Down the hills and up the dale
Had a CJ-5 with four wheel drive
And Smokey on my tail
Well, he picked me up at exit 12
On the I-680 ramp
I was doin' sixty seven per
When I rumbled through his trap
He commenced to whirl his flashing lights
And he made his siren wail
I slipped on down to four wheel drive
With Smokey on my tail
Now, I've got racing stripes
And dual pipes
And Smokey's got a Ford
Got a mill with a four-pot carb, you know
But Smokey's stroked and bored
Well, the chase was on
But I had the edge
With a rig that'll never fail
Got a CJ-5 with a four wheel drive
With Smokey on my tail
Yeah, he was
Well, I dropped on down to granny low
And I made a hard right turn
My big ol' fat Commando tires
Went slashin' through the corn
Well, the tassels blew and the kernels flew
And it looked like yellow hail
Just cookin' alive in a four wheel drive
With Smokey on my tail

Look out now, here he come
Oh, we gonna get it on now
Don't hit that fella with the banjo
We gon' swim this here crick now, Smokey
Yard wide and a foot deep
Nishnabotna River, they call it
Might have to winch out
Gon' do a wheelie on that there gopher mound now, Smokey
Can you dig it, Smokey?
Got four on the floor and four in the air on that one, didn't we?
Goodness gracious
'Bout to bust my shocks
Well, that Jeep of mine made Smokey whine
His rig was made of lead
He was mired in fourteen feet of mud
So he radioed ahead
I pulled up onto the blacktop
Went crashin' on through the rail
Sakes alive, I had twenty five more Smokeys on my tail
Now I had racing stripes and dual pipes
And Smokey had a Ford
Had a mill with a four-pot carb, you know
But Smokey's stroked and bored
Well, the race was on
But I had the edge
With a rig that'll never fail
Got a CJ-5 with a four-wheel drive
Sittin' out back of the jail
