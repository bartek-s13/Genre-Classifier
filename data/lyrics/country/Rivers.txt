I told you I'd never leave you
I told you I’d be here for it all
You said that you wanna see the sun
I promise I'll always have your heart

I know where we belong, I know where we feel free
And it goes on and on, like rivers to the sea
I knew it all along that you were meant for me
And it goes on and on, like rivers to the sea

Like rivers
Like rivers

Whenever you need me, baby
Whenever you're lonely, I’ll be here
You said you wanna see the sun
I told you I'll always take you there

I know where we belong, I know where we feel free
And it goes on and on, like rivers to the sea
I knew it all along that you were meant for me
And it goes on and on, like rivers to the sea

Like rivers
Like rivers

Now that we're dancing in the sun
Do you feel the heat, my love?
Now I know there is only one
You for me in my heart

I know where we belong, I know where we feel free
And it goes on and on, like rivers to the sea
I knew it all along that you were meant for me
And it goes on and on, like rivers to the sea

Like rivers
Like rivers
Like rivers
