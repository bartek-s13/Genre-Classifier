Whoa I wish I was down in Dixie tonight
Where the stars line up and the mood gets right
Baby looks good in the Delta sky
Whoa I wish I was down in Dixie tonight

Where we were
Wilder Horses
Stronger whiskey
Faster two lanes
Every other mile marker you kiss me
And I would hold you
And love was easy
Your head up against my chest
Wide open
Runnin' down that sunset
We were
Wilder Horses
We were
Wilder Horses

I think about you a little too much these days
Ridin' no-name lost back roads we take
Ain't easy for gettin' out innocent stays
Whoa I wish I was down in Dixie tonight
Where we were
Wilder Horses
Stronger whiskey
Faster two lanes
Every other mile marker you kiss me
And I would hold you
And love was easy
Your head up against my chest
Wide open
Runnin' down that sunset
We were
Wilder Horses
We were
Wilder Horses

Looks like home all around you
But it ain't
Home there without you
I know, I know
Without you there ain't no

Wilder Horses
Wilder Horses
Where we were
Wilder Horses
Stronger whiskey
Faster two lanes
Every other mile marker you kiss me
And I would hold you
And love was easy
Your head up against my chest
Wide open
Runnin' down that sunset
We were
Wilder Horses
We were
Wilder Horses

I think about you a little too much these days
Ain't easy for gettin' out innocent stays
