She likes the Beatles and I like the Stones
She likes romantic movies I like Indiana Jones
She goes to church and I stay at home
Oh she likes the Beatles and I like the Stones

We met by the river in the mid-morning light
She swears it was late afternoon
Well she fell in love by the time it was night
But I didn't give in 'till June
Well not long after we said I do she had the nerve to move in
She painted the walls she penned up my dog and
She kicked out all of my friends

She likes the Beatles and I like the Stones
She likes romantic movies I like Indiana Jones
She goes to church and I stay at home
Oh she likes the Beatles and I like the Stones

She burns through money like I burn through smokes
But she says that I need to quit
'Cause if I die from cancer in 25 years
She'll have to pay off the debt
No she don't think I'm funny she don't laugh at my jokes
I could care less about all her shoes
My parents both hate her but it evens out
Cause her parents both hate me too
She likes the Beatles and I like the Stones
She likes romantic movies I like Indiana Jones
She goes to church and I stay at home
Oh she likes the Beatles and I like the Stones

She brings me coffee when I'm working late
She lifts me up when I'm low
She understands that I'm carrying weight
That I just have to hold up alone
She's determined and honest she's stubborn and strong
And I always know where she stands
So it never bugs me when she's always wrong
As long as she's wrong with her hand in my hand

She likes the Beatles and I like the Stones
She likes romantic movies I like Indiana Jones
She goes to church and I stay at home
Oh she likes the Beatles and I like the Stones
