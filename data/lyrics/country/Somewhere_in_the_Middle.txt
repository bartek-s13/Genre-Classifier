Couldn't have ever dawned on me, all the things that
I would be I, I never really looked out quite that far
It's never been a simple thing, to see the world with a
Young man's brain with, an old man's heart, restless soul

Yeah, my family went broke in my eighteenth year
Dad took a job many miles from here that
That was alright by me I was on my own
I had a band, found a job, life was alright
I worked when I had to, we played all the time
Only, got through that first year of college alright

But I learned more on the freight docks
Driving forklifts on the 3 o'clock AM shift
In the winter time, man it got cold
Selling guitars on the west coast
Going hungry, chasin' ghost around
And around we would go
And I saw it all tendin' bar at night
Treatin' saints and sinners right
Is a good thing to do all the time
You never know who you're talkin' to
But always know who's watching you
Keep your feet movin' straight down the line

I've known a lot of real good men, grad school or no school
I've called em' my friends I'm
I'm somewhere in the middle and that's just fine
No, I don't give a damn how much money you make
If your last shirt has pockets, take all you can take I'm
Well, I'm goin' out with nothin' like I came in

Cause I learned more on the freight docks
Driving forklifts on the 3 o'clock AM shift
In the winter time, man it got cold
Selling guitars on the west coast
Going hungry, chasin' ghost around
And around we would go
And I saw it all tendin' bar at night
Treatin' saints and sinners right
Is a good thing to do all the time
You never know who you're talkin' to
But always know who's watching you
Keep your feet movin' straight down the line

Yeah and somewhere in the middle is just fine
