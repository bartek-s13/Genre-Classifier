He was workin' through college
On my grandpa's farm
I was thirstin' for knowledge
And he had a car
I was caught somewhere
Between a woman and a child
One restless summer
We found love growin' wild
On the banks on the river
On a well-beaten path
It's funny how those memories they last

Like strawberry wine, seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
The first taste of love, oh, bittersweet
The green on the vine
Like strawberry wine

Yeah, I still remember
When thirty was old
My biggest fear was September
When he had to go
A few cards and letters
And one long distance call
We drifted away like the leaves in the fall
But year after year
I come back to this place
Just to remember the taste
Of strawberry wine, seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
The first taste of love, oh, bittersweet
The green on the vine
Like strawberry wine

The fields have grown over now
Years since they've seen a plough
There's nothin' time hasn't touched
Is it really him or the loss of my innocence
I've been missin' so much?
Yeah, yeah

Strawberry wine, seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love, oh, bittersweet
The green on the vine
Like strawberry wine, seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love, oh, bittersweet
The green on the vine
Like strawberry wine
Strawberry wine
