Baby, you gotta know what you're getting yourself into
You're tryna fit inside a heart
I'm telling you it ain't got no room
And trust me, I know that you don't get told "no" that much
But here's the honest truth

You could be fine, you could be sweet
You could be everything that I need
Could be the fix, could be the cure, but whatever you are girl
One thing's for sure, you'll never be her, her, her, her
You'll never be her, her, her

And I'll never be waking up feeling what you want me to feel
Somebody already took what you're trying to steal
And even a stranger'd be wrapped round your finger
But baby if I'm being real...

You could be fine, you could be sweet
You could be everything that I need
Could be the fix, could be the cure, but whatever you are girl
One thing's for sure, you'll never be her, her, her, her
You'll never be her, her, her

Yeah my baby, she can be a trip, she's a handful and I can handle it
She's a firecracker and I'm already lit, I'm already lit, I'm already lit
She's the sway to my sway, best I'm ever gonna have
Might sound crazy, but it doesn't matter baby

You could be fine, you could be sweet
You could be everything that I need
Could be the fix, could be the cure, but whatever you are girl
One thing's for sure, you'll never be her, her, her, her
You'll never be her, her, her
No, you'll never be her, her, her, her
No, you'll never, no you'll never
No, you'll never be her, her, her, her
You'll never be her, her, her, her
