You called me up from Amarillo, said you were comin' to town
And thought I'd like to tell you hello, and drive an old friend around
I pulled up to the airport, confident and cool
But when you stepped off that plane, I knew I was your fool

My little Texas tornado, blowin' me away again
I swore it wouldn't happen again, but I looked at you and then
I'm like a tumbleweed in a wild west Texas wind
You're blowin' me away, again

You're lyin' with me in Atlanta, it's such a beautiful lie
You play me like a piano, I always let you get by
I know I'll go through hell, girl, when you find someone else
But right now I'm in heaven, and I can't help myself

My little Texas tornado, blowin' me away again
I swore it wouldn't happen again, but I looked at you and then
I'm like a tumbleweed in a wild west Texas wind
You're blowin' me away, again


I'm like a tumbleweed in a wild west Texas wind
You're blowin' me away
Texas tornado, blowin' me away again
I swore it wouldn't happen again, but I looked at you and then
I'm like a tumbleweed in a wild west Texas wind
You're blowin' me away
Texas tornado, blowin' me away again
