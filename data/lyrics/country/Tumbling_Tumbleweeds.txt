See them tumbling down
Pledging their love to the ground
Lonely but free I'll be found
Drifting along with the tumblin' tumbleweeds
Cares of the past are behind
Nowhere to go, but I'll find
Just where the trail will wind
Drifting along with the tumblin' tumbleweeds
I know when night has gone
That a new world's born at dawn
I'll keep rolling along
Deep in my heart is a song
Here on the range I belong
Drifting along with the tumblin' tumbleweeds
I know when night has gone
That a new world's born at dawn
I'll keep rolling along
Deep in my heart is a song
Here on the range I belong
Drifting along with the tumblin' tumbleweeds
Drifting along with the tumblin' tumbleweeds
Tumbleweeds, tumbleweeds
Tumble weeds
