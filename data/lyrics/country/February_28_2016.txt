Throw that bottle of whiskey under the seat
Light a cigarette so he don't smell the weed
If he asks me to blow I'mma tell his punk ass to take me to jail
I've been here time and time before
Rocky Mountains to Midway with every whore
In a 25 mile circumference of this damned ole town

Singin' la la la la let's pull over
I can't hold it will you turn the music up?
And let's play critter critter
Who is sober enough to take me to Taco Bell?

Last night was crazy and
There ain't a dent in my truck so we're golden Lord
We wanna thank you again
For watchin' over us when all we do is sin
Let's go to Mr. J's buy another case
Pack of cigarettes and be on our way
Back to the boneyard
Oh dear Lord

Singin' la la la la let's pull over
I can't hold it will you turn the music up?
And let's play critter critter
Who is sober enough to take me to Taco Bell?
Singin' la la la la let's pull over
I can't hold it will you turn the music up?
And let's play critter critter
Who is sober enough to take me to, to take me to

La la la la let's pull over
I can't hold it
Will you turn the music up?
And let's play critter critter
Who is sober enough to take me to Taco Bell?
Singin' Who is sober
Who is Sober?
Enough to take me to taco bell

I need a taco, I'm drunk for some tacos
Will somebody take me to taco bell?
