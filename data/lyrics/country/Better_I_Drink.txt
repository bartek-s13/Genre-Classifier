Her memory used to kill me, but I found a remedy
It's a plastic cup with domestic draft and I start with two or three
And when the floodgates of emotion, they slowly start to crack
I mix it tall with something strong 'til I don't want her back

Hit me with a shot from the top shelf
I'm pouring out all of my pain
I'm starting to think I'm getting good at this
The more I feel the better I drink
Drink, drink, line 'em up, honey
I got a tab and a pocket full of money
Gonna drown my heart in a whiskey rain
The more I feel the better I drink

Bartender, here's my license, go ahead and take my keys
'Cause it's a backsliding to missing her night and you know my routine, just

Hit me with a shot from the top shelf
I'm pouring out all of my pain
I'm starting to think I'm getting good at this
The more I feel the better I drink
Drink, drink, line 'em up, honey
I got a tab and a pocket full of money
Gonna drown my heart in a whiskey rain
The more I feel the better I drink

I'm on that premium, no need for a chaser after
The bartender's looking for a stepladder
Bottles so high, I can't read the labels
Do yourself a favor man, just leave it on the table
On a roll, ain't stopping 'til the night is over
A hundred dollar shot makes a thousand dollar hangover
They say, you can't put a price on love
But there's a price on bourbon so it's close enough

Hit me with a shot from the top shelf
I'm pouring out all of my pain
I'm starting to think I'm getting good at this
The more I feel the better I drink
Drink, drink, line 'em up, honey
I got a tab and a pocket full of money
Gonna drown my heart in a whiskey rain
The more I feel the better I drink

(The deeper I go, the further I sink
The more I feel the better I drink)
The better I drink
(The longer I stay the less I think
The more I feel the better I drink)
The better I drink
