Who was once a bull hooking son of a gun?
Now who keeps a pint hid out behind chute No 1?
Who was ridin' high till a pretty girl rode him to the ground?
Any kid knows where to find me: I'm Bandy the rodeo clown
In the ridin' and a ropin' I was closin' in on No 1
Now in dreams at night I ride on that silver saddle I never won
Since she left me the whiskey takes me to the rodeo grounds
Where the cowboys think I'm handy, I'm Bandy the rodeo clown
I could ride 'em all, the bulls and the broncos knew I was boss
But the ride that woman took me on broke a whole lot more than this ole cowboy's bones
While the tears on my make-up melts my painted smile into a frown
The crowd thinks I'm a dandy, I'm Bandy the rodeo clown
And I could ride 'em all the bulls and the broncos knew I was boss
