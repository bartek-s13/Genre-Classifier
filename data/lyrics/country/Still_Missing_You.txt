Label said hero, I graduated zero
I was doing what I could to get by
Jody was a looker, a high school hooker
She loved to make the big boys cry
My time is still standing seems never ending
Got a loaded pistol by my side
Dirty brass polls lines up her nose
I always knew she would be a black dress bride

Ought to be crazy, I'm too damn lazy
To sit around thinking of you
I should have somehow realized by now
I'm doing something I shouldn't do
I'm hurting so strung out still missing you
Laid out before me
She said she adored me
And she told me that she liked to get high
Talking about a big deal
Devil in high heels
She took me for a one way ride
How did it come to this
Power of a woman's kiss
Put me in a grave close by
Dealt a bad hand
I know I should have ran
I guess it probably could have saved my life
Ought to be crazy I'm too damn lazy
To sit around thinking of you
I should have somehow realized by now
I'm doing something I shouldn't do
I'm going straight out of my head still missing you
I'm still missing you

Ought to be crazy, I'm too damn lazy
To sit around thinking of you
I should have somehow realized by now
I'm doing something I shouldn't do
I'm hurting so strung out still missing you
