Mama put brother on the prayer list
When he got caught smoking that pot
Daddy found out, first thing he could grab
And he whipped him with a Zebco rod
When we messed up, she'd fill us up
With the scripture and a baptist hymn
And she prayed we’d be a little more like her
And whole lotta less like him

Mama loved Jesus, Daddy loved Jack Daniels
She was red-letter Heaven, he was Old No. 7
Between the two of 'em, wasn't nothing they couldn’t handle
Mama loved Jesus, Daddy loved Jack Daniels

He hated how she never had no fun
She hated how he had too much
I got a little bit from both of them
A little Bible and a little buzz
I wound up turning out, smack dab in-between
His taste for Lynchburg and her grace from John 3:16

Mama loved Jesus, Daddy loved Jack Daniels
She was red-letter Heaven, he was Old No. 7
Between the two of 'em, wasn't nothing they couldn't handle
Mama loved Jesus, Daddy loved Jack Daniels

I'm a little "Hell yeah," I'm a little "Hallelujah"
If there's a stool or a pew, I might sit down next to ya

Mama loved Jesus, Daddy loved Jack Daniels
She was red-letter Heaven, he was Old No. 7
Between the two of 'em, wasn’t nothing they couldn’t handle
Mama loved Jesus, Daddy loved Jack Daniels
