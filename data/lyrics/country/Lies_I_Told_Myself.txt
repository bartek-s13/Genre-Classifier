Guys like you don't ever finish high school
You probably ought quit and get a job
You're going to wind up a drunk just like your uncle
I know you think you're different, but you're not

You're too small to catch a football
You're a fool to follow your heart
Crazy for even thinking you've got a chance with that guitar
And who they said you were
Is who you'll always be
Some lies I told myself
I'm glad I didn't believe

Money's the only thing that makes you happy
And what you're looking for ain't in that church
A love like that only happens in the movies
A boy like you can't get a girl like her


Yeah praying's just a waste of time
So why even start
The good Lord ain't got time for guys like me
Forgiven is something you won't ever be
Some lies I told myself
I'm glad I didn't believe
