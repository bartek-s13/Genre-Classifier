There's something about this time of day
The sun goes home and the shadows fade
All my thoughts come out to play
I count them one by one...
And I come undone
When the lights turn on in the streets tonight, and the moon hangs low in the empty sky
I'll be thinking of you, wondering why I'm a million miles away
Just out here spinning around, waiting to touch back down, like a satellite
Maybe if I could fall asleep, I'd meet you somewhere in my dreams
Promise that you'll look for me, I'll be the one with the empty cup
Then I'll wake up
When the lights turn on in the streets tonight, and the moon hangs low in the empty sky
I'll be thinking of you, wondering why I'm a million miles away
Just out here spinning around, waiting to touch back down, like a satellite
I feel like I'm lost out here, floating around in the atmosphere
When the lights turn on in the streets tonight, and the moon hangs low in the empty sky
I'll be thinking of you, wondering why I'm a million miles away
When the lights turn on in the streets tonight, and the moon hangs low in the empty sky
I'll be thinking of you, wondering why I'm a million miles away
Just out here spinning around, waiting to touch back down, like a satellite
Like a satellite
When the lights come on in the streets tonight
I'll be your satellite
