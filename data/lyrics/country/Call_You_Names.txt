I remember you caught me
With that first cigarette I smoked
If you'd have heard what I called you
You'da washed my mouth out with soap
I remember that curfew
You said, "Don't you come home a minute late"
I told my friends all about you
And how you were just so lame

I called you all the names I could think of
That painted you in the most colorful light
Called you controlling, I called you mean
I called you everything in between
I couldn't wait to break your chains
So I called you names

Now I'm here in this little one bedroom apartment
And I call you wondering how to
Get a wine stain out of the carpet
And we talk for an hour
'Bout my heart, the rent, and the rain
But what I'm really trying to say is
I'm sorry for the hell I raised

Now I call you all the names I can think of
That paint you in the most beautiful light
I call you mama, my best friend
My everything 'til the end
I call you my angel, I call you a saint
Yeah, I call you names

If you'd have told me
How I'd feel right now about you
And that I'd call you every day
I woulda called you crazy, mmm

Now I call you all the names I can think of
That paint you in the most beautiful light
I call you mama, my best friend
My everything 'til the end
I call you my angel, I call you a saint
Yeah, I call you names

I call you amazing
Yeah, I call you names
