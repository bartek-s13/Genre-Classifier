Ain't nothing so precious as a first born child
What to call alil angel that they wanted for awhile
Your dear mama Violet
Your proud daddy Dale
I know when they named you they surely meant well
But Vidalia, Vidalia girl won't you tell me why
Sweet Vidalia you always got to make me cry
I never paid no attention to a girl before
Till the day i saw you standing in the sunday school door
One boy sorda snickered when the roll was read
Till you laid the word of god upsideof his head
Vidalia, Vidalia girl won't you tell me why
Sweet Vidalia you always got to make me cry
When i try to get to close seems like we've always been
Almost just a one step or two away from true love
Well i love the way you walk
I love the way you kiss
I love to get away with you alone like this
If i could just amention one thing
Vidalia would you stop alivin up to your name
Vidalia, Vidalia girl won't you tell me why
Sweet vidalia you always got to make me cry
Vidalia, Vidalia girl won't you tell me why
Sweet Vidalia you always got to make me cry
You always gotta make me cry you always gotta make me cry
You always gotta make me cry
