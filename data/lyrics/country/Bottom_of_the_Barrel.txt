You got a lot of glitter in your pocket
A title on your name
A big-timin' life you'd love to wish away
Is it worth the climb just for the high
You wonder why sometimes, you wonder why
Come on
Get down

Come on, get down to the barely-gettin'-by
Back down where the well's run dry
There's a whole lot of lovin', the livin' comes cheap
Down at the bottom of the barrel with me
Come on
Get down
Come on, get down

So you miss the bliss of waitin' on nothin'
Knowing everybody's name
Simply to like driftin' before it was in vain
Ain't it worth the fall to lose it all?
All that weight on your heart
Listen to your spirit call
Come on
Get down
Come on, get down to the barely-gettin'-by
Back down where the well's run dry
There's a whole lot of lovin', the livin' comes cheap
Down at the bottom of the barrel with me
Come on
Get down

Come on, get down to the barely-gettin'-by
Back down where the well's run dry
There's a whole lot of lovin', the livin' comes cheap
Down at the bottom of the barrel with me
Come on
Get down

Come on, get down to the barely-gettin'-by
Back down where the well's run dry
There's a whole lot of lovin'
The livin' comes cheap
Down at the bottom of the barrel with me
