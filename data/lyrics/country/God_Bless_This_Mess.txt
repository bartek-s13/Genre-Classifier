Here's to the brokens
The misfits and wannabes
The part of you that's just like me
The wallflowers and the holier than thou's
To the diamonds that are never gonna leave the rough
The rolling stones that are always stuck
The all nighters and the lost I've never found

God bless this mess
If this is as good as it's gonna get
I'm gonna hold you like I know it's gonna be okay again
I got a hurricane in my heart
Keeps on rattling the good apart
And honestly, I'm just an honest wreck
But I'm trying my best
God bless this mess, oh, god bless this mess

Here's to the waiting
All the waiting that we have to do
The dreams we make that never come true
And all the hurting that comes without warning
Here's to the view from the tile of the bathroom floor
Ain't we all been there before?
And the hell bent sun that's gonna come up the next morning
God bless this mess
If this is as good as it's gonna get
I'm gonna hold you like I know it's gonna be okay again
I got a hurricane in my heart
Keeps on rattling the good apart
And honestly, I'm just an honest wreck
But I'm trying my best
God bless this mess, oh, god bless this mess

Most the time I forget to pray
But when I close my eyes, I just say
God bless this mess
If this is as good as it's gonna get

God bless this mess
If this is as good as it's gonna get
I'm gonna hold you like I know it's gonna be okay again
I got a hurricane in my heart
Keeps on rattling the good apart
And honestly, I'm just an honest wreck
But I'm trying my best
God bless this mess, oh, god bless this mess
