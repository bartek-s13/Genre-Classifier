Lately life with you has been unbearable
All my faith in you has gone and I know it won't return

I did everything to make you happy I could do
Now you've gotten me hatin' things I used to love to do
And it won't be long, and I'll be hatin' you

Whatever happened to the love that we once knew?
Was it jealousy
Or did you just grow tired of having me around you?

I did everything to make you happy I could do
You've gotten me hatin' things I used to love to do
And it won't be long, and I'll be hatin' you

After the beating my heart has took, it should be black and blue
But you just won't admit, that we are through

Now you've gotten me hatin' things I used to love to do
And it won't be long, and I'll be hatin' you
It won't be long, and I'll be hatin' you
