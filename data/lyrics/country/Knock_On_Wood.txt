I'm gonna change the world
Just me and this guitar
And I'm gonna bank more money
Than you can fit in 20 tip jars
Then I'm gonna leave those bars
For a sell out in Madison square
18 thousand screaming fans
Burning lighters in the air
Knock on wood
With a little luck from up above
Coming down from the man upstairs
I'll be the song that you sing along
On some radio somewhere
And all those doubters and demons
Who thought they could stop my dreaming
Can stick it where the sun don't shine for good
Knock on wood
I'm gonna find a woman
One who's better than the last
The one who sees my future
And wants it just as bad
As I do, and that's the truth
Yeah, I'm gonna find her soon
Knock on wood
With a little luck from up above
Coming down from the man upstairs
I'll be the song that you sing along
On some radio somewhere
And all those doubters and demons
Who thought they could stop my dreaming
Can stick it where the sun don't shine for good
Knock on wood
It's a wonder this ol' fist
Hadn't knocked a hole right through it
This table where my momma sat
And said, son you can do it
I swear it's gonna work out like it should
Knock on wood
Knock on wood
Knock on wood
I'm gonna change the world
Just me and this guitar
