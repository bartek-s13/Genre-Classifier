I know a new boogie that can't be beat
It's mighty low down and make you shake your feet

It's the dog house boogie (The dog house boogie)
It's the dog house boogie (The dog house boogie)
Everybody's doing the dog house boogie now

Now I know a woman she's eight-two
I ain't found a thing that she can't do

About the dog house boogie (The dog house boogie)
About the dog house boogie (The dog house boogie)
Everybody's doing the dog house boogie now

Now she drinks whiskey and she drinks gin
And she puts me in the dog house time and again

She does the dog house boogie (The dog house boogie)
The dog house boogie (The dog house boogie)
Everybody's doing the dog house boogie now

She can do it low down she can do it mean
She shakes around like a thrashing machine

She does the dog house boogie (The dog house boogie)
The dog house boogie (The dog house boogie)
Everybody's doing the dog house boogie now
