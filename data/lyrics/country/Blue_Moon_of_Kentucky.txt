Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shinin'
Shine on the one who's gone and proved untrue
Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shinin'
Shine on the one who's gone and left me blue
It was on a moonlit night
The stars were shining bright
They whispered from on high
Your love has said goodbye
Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shinin'
Shine on the one who's gone and said goodbye
‘I’m going to take a minute to say thanks tho those who helped me put the album together
