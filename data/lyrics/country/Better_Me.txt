I'm getting older
Finding myself and God getting a little bit closer
And Sober
I'm a little less reckless, little less wild card
Breaking hearts kinda senseless
Yeah, I'm coming around

I might cuss and fight, tell a few lies
Break a few rules, making promises I can't keep
But I've turned the page on wilder days
I'm writing all this down hoping you'll see
I ain't saying I'm perfect, but I'm working on a better me

I say I'm sorry
Sometimes it's the hardest part to tell somebody
But baby I'm sorry
Yeah I've been praying
Coming from me that might sound a little bit crazy
But I swear I'm changing

I might cuss and fight, tell a few lies
Break a few rules, making promises I can't keep
But I've turned the page on wilder days
I'm running all this down hoping you'll see
I ain't saying I'm perfect, but I'm working on a better me yeah
Didn't wanna call you up
Didn't wanna just stop
Wanted to take my time and make sure I got every word right

Yeah, I still cuss and fight
Tell you lies
Break a few rules, making promises I can't keep
But I've turned the page on wilder days
I'm running all this down hoping you'll see
I ain't saying I'm perfect, but I'm working on a better me
I ain't saying I'm perfect, but I'm working on a better me
On a better me
Better me
