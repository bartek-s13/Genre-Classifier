I'm gonna find you I'm gonna find you I'm gonna find you if it's the last thing I do
I'm a goin' lookin' in the night time I'm gonna find you
Any time will be the right time I'm gonna find you
I'm a gonna lookin' in the mornin' baby I'm givin' you a warnin'
Cause I'm gonna find you I'm gonna find you
I'm gonna find you if it's the last thing I do
I'm a gonna lookin' on the mountain top I'm gonna find you
I'm a gonna lookin' until I'll drop I'm gonna find you
If you think as free as big blue hound (it's gotta be me just a trackin' you down)
I'm gonna find you I'm gonna find you I'm gonna find you if it's the last thing I do
I'll keep a searchin' for your sweet face I'm gonna find
Here on earth or in out of space I'm gonna find you
I'm so tired of livin' alone (I'll even meet you in the twilight zone)
I'm gonna find you I'm gonna find you I'm gonna find you if it's the last thing I do
If it's the last thing I do
