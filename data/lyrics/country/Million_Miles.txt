There's a million miles between you and I
But I don't care
There's a burnin' sun on the other side
I don't care
Theres a black car starin' me down fight or flight, do I turn do I run?
There's a sharp blade on my back, six shots in a loaded gun
There's a million miles between you and I
I don't care
There's a burnin' sun on the other side
I don't care
Theres a black car starin' me down fight or flight, do I turn do I run?
There's a sharp blade on my back, six shots in a loaded gun
There's a million miles between you and I
I don't care
Hear the ringin' bells runnin' out of time
I don't care
Comin' through the dark, stumblin' around fallin' down
I don't know where to run
There's a dark place inside my head where the light has not begun
There's a million miles between you and I
I don't care
Hear the raven sound comin' from behind
I don't care
And the spotlight moon sings a lonesome tune
Turnin' bums into dust
Lookin' down on me, ragged on my knees like I'm no one to trust
There's a million miles between you and I
