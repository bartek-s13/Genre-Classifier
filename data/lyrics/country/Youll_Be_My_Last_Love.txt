Restless waves caress the shore when we met on the island
Strangers then but not for love our eyes spoke of love
Soon there'll be an ocean between us sweetheart
Very well you'll be my last love
This may very well be our last meeting
This could very well be our last kiss
This may be the last time I hold you in my arms
Very well you'll be my last love
Somehow I knew this couldn't last forever
Somehow I guess I knew this day would finally come
I guess this is goodbye forever my love
Very well we'll just say farewell
This may very well be our last meeting...
Very well you'll be my last love
