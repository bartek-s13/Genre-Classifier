Sometimes no matter how hard you try
This life's gonna be unfair sometimes
I see you looking at me like you wanna know why
Baby, you got me, you got me
I don't know why the wind that blows
Ain't ever at our back
Or that the road that we're rollin on ain't ever flat
It turns and it twists
Don't know what the answer is, but
You, you got me
When the pieces don't fall together
When you wish your best was better, baby
You, you got me
Right here by your side hanging on for the ride
When your dreams don't dream and the songs don't sing
And the grass ain't green and the ends don't meet
And the prayers you're sending up don't seem to reach
You got me
Those days when your faith ain't pulling you through
I'll be right there believing enough for two
When you don't give a damn cause you think that you can't
Get the mountain to move I'll be saying we can
I'll be taking your hand, and I'll never let go
Baby you gotta know
That you, you got me
When the pieces don't fall together
When you wish your best was better, baby
You, you got me
Right here by your side hanging on for the ride
When your dreams don't dream and the songs don't sing
And the grass ain't green and the ends don't meet
And the prayers you're sending up don't seem to reach
You got me
Sometimes no matter how hard you try
This life's gonna be unfair sometimes
But you, you got me
When the pieces don't fall together
When you wish your best was better, baby
You, you got me
Right here by your side hanging on for the ride
When your dreams don't dream and the songs don't sing
And the grass ain't green and the ends don't meet
And the prayers you're sending up don't seem to reach
You got me
You got me
