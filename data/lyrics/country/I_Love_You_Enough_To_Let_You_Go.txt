It breaks my heart to see
That you're unhappy here with me
The hurt you've tried to hide can't help but show
I could cling to the past
But I'm afraid it wouldn't last
And I love you enough to let you go
Don't think that I'm all through
Or that I'm giving up on you
Our love's the most important thing I know
But if I set you free
It just might bring you back to me
And I love you enough to let you go
I'll stand and hold the door
And watch you walk away
And welcome you with open arms
If you come back someday
But for now it would be wrong
To keep trying to hold on
And I love you enough to let you go
I'll stand and hold the door
And watch you walk away
And welcome you with open arms
If you come back someday
But for now it would be wrong
To keep trying to hold on
And I love you enough to let you go
