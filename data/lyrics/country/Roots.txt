He's a junior
Star of his hometown team
Got the grades, got the girl, got it all so it seems
Those big game lights in his eyes
Never felt so alive, so wild, so free
Now the fall has come and gone
He's got his country colours on
Sitting there in the drive with his dad
And he says...

When the stars line on up
And you finally strike gold
When the pressure's way too much
But the diamond starts to show
When your prayers get answered
God's plan unfolds
Now don't you forget to...
Make mistakes, lose your way
Get some dirt on your boots
Call your mom, write your friends
Ones that were there for you
Remember all of them people
When your dreams come true
Now don't you forget your roots
She has seen him
Giving his heart to the game
Every night paid the price now he's finally got a break
Calls home saying 'Mom we've been dreaming 'bout this day.'
Tears streaming down his face
Through the phone and his momma she says...

When the stars line on up
And you finally strike gold
When the pressure's way too much
But the diamond starts to show
When your prayers get answered
God's plan unfolds
Now don't you forget to...
Make mistakes, lose your way
Get some dirt on your boots
Call your mom, write your friends
Ones that were there for you
Remember all of them people
When your dreams come true
Now don't you forget your roots

Oh, now don't you forget your roots
Oh
When the stars line on up
And you finally strike gold
When the pressure's way too much
But the diamond starts to show
When your prayers get answered
God's plan unfolds
Now don't you forget to...
Make mistakes, lose your way
Get some dirt on your boots
Call your mom, write your friends
Ones that were there for you
Remember all of them people
When your dreams come true
Now don't you forget your roots
Now don't you forget your roots
