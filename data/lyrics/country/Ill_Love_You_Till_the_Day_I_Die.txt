Alone here at home while you're free to run and roam
There's no use in tryin' to make my dreams come true
You have always lied to me, my darlin' I can't see
Any reason for my stayin' here alone
I never start our quarrels and I never rush off mad
I'm the one that asks forgiveness, to love you makes me glad
Life isn't worth it's troubles when when you're livin' withregret
Sometimes I wish that we had never met
After all I've been to you seems you'd be just halfway true
That's expectin' too much from a cheat like you
But I know someday you'll care and, my dear, I won't be there
And you'll be the one who sits alone and cries
Alone and so blue and so much in love with you
Why, oh why did God make such a fool as I
Though your love has been untrue I'm still in love with you
And I guess I'll love you till the day I die
