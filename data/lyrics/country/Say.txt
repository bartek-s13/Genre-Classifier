You say you're coming over
Is it okay you're coming over?
I hear your keys fumbling
I hear your words stumbling
I can't help but think it's cute
When you say that you're nervous
You look away when you're nervous
Hands digging deep in your pockets
Heart taking off like a rocket
Glueing your eyes to your shoes

You don't have to say that you want me
With anything but your eyes
I can tell that you need me
By the quiet in your smile
And the way that you wait
To kiss me goodnight
I hear everything, everything you can't say
 
You say that I'm crazy
That it's making you crazy too, mmm
How you can't get me off of your mind
And you say that it's getting kinda late
Should be getting out of here
But you hesitate and I'm gonna take it as a sign

You don't have to say that you want me
With anything but your eyes
I can tell that you need me
By the quiet in your smile
And the way that you wait
To kiss me goodnight
I hear everything, everything you can't say

Something 'bout tonight
Something 'bout your lips
Something 'bout the touch of your fingertips
Something 'bout the way you're pulling me closer

You don't have to say that you want me
With anything but your eyes
I can tell that you need me
By the quiet in your smile
And the way that you wait
To kiss me goodnight
I hear everything, everything you can't
I hear everything, everything you can't say
You can't say
