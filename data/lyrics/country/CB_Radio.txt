Midnight drives and caffeine highs
Crossing countless county lines
I get way more than ample time to think
My phone dies to no surprise
CD skips the songs I like
That FM preacher might be right
But he hits too close to home
So I turned on my dad's old CB
Started searching all those frequencies
Heard a graveled voice on channel 3
So I tuned in for a while

He said hey if you're listenin'
And you're out there on your own
If you're runnin' from somethin'
Or a couple miles from home
This ain't no fire and brimstone
I just want you to know
That there's hope or forgiveness
Never being alone
My whole life it changed that night
50 miles from Tupelo
You can lead a man to Jesus
On a CB radio

He went on and on about his life
'bout the day he lost his wife
And all the times he wasn't thinking right
With the bottle in his hand
Used to wish he could turn back time
Fix those loose ends left untied
How it's hard as hell to swallow pride
When it's all you have to hold

He said hey if you're listenin'
And you're out there on your own
If you're runnin' from somethin'
Or a couple miles from home
This ain't no fire and brimstone
I just want you to know
That there's hope or forgiveness
Never being alone
My whole life it changed that night
50 miles from Tupelo
You can lead a man to Jesus
On a CB radio

Well the signal started fadin'
About the time the dawn was breaking
I parked the car and started praying
For the first time in a while

Well I said hey if you're listening
I'm just out on this road
I've been running from something
I'm a long way from home
I've had my fair share of mess-ups
And I'm needin' to know
That there's hope or forgiveness
Never being alone
My whole life it changed that night
50 miles from Tupelo
You can lead a man to Jesus
