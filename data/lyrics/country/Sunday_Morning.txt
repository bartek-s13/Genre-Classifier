City lights blurring lines, feels like the world's on fire
Chasing minutes in the back of this cab, counting every single mile
I ain't thinking 'bout tomorrow, I ain't thinking 'bout days gone by
I'm just thinking 'bout, getting to wherever you are tonight

'Cause when I get lonely
You don't have to get on my mind
'Cause you're already on it
And you touch me just in time
Making it all feel alright
Slowing it all down just right
When I'm lost on a Saturday night
Baby you save me just like
Sunday morning
Sunday morning

I feel the sun on my face coming through trying to wake us up
With your arms around me I ain't thinking about what it is, or what it was
I just feel the peace all around like there's barely a sound, out on the street
Like a church choir, hallelujah, raining down on me

'Cause when I get lonely
You don't have to get on my mind
'Cause you're already on it
And you touch me just in time
Making it all feel alright
Slowing it all down just right
When I'm lost on a Saturday night
Baby you save me just like
Sunday morning
Sunday morning
Oh, ain't nothing like the way you bring the crazy down
Oh, girl you got me feeling dizzy right now

'Cause when I get lonely
You don't have to get on my mind
'Cause you're already on it
And you touch me just in time
Making it all feel alright
Slowing it all down just right
When I'm lost on a Saturday night
Baby you save me just like
Sunday morning
Sunday morning
