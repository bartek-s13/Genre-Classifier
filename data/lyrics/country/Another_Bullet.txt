Break all the horses
You can't have no spirit here
They're huttin' down a way of life
Thats stood a lot of years

And progress is gonna get us
If the smoke and the whiskey don't
But you'd think that they'd leave
Us well enough alone

So set the free range up in smoke
They might as well just let it go
You can't work and you can't ride
'Cause there ain't no fields left to run
All the fences done gone up
There ain't no cattle drive
Another bullet in the cowboy life

It's gettin' harder to find tough
There ain't a scuff on no boots
It seems these days that a man
Ain't got a thing to prove

Boys that grew up on backbreakin'
Hard labor and calloused hands
And if you've got a problem
Step out back and take a chance

So set the free range up in smoke
They might as well just let it go
You can't work and you can't ride
'Cause there ain't no fields left to run
All the fences done gone up
There ain't no cattle drive
Another bullet in the cowboy life

So set the free range up in smoke
They might as well just let it all go
You can't work, you can't ride
'Cause there ain't no fields left to run
All the fences done gone up
There ain't no cattle drive
Another bullet in the cowboy life
Another bullet in the cowboy life
