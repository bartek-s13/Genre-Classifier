She tried to hide it by the faded denim clothes she wore
But I knew she'd never been inside a bar before
And I felt like a peasant who just had met a queen
And she knew I saw right through her tight fitting jeans

I asked her what's a lady like you doing here
I see you're used to champagne but I'll buy you a beer
She said you've got me figured out but I'm not what I seem
And for a dance I'll tell you 'bout these tight fitting jeans

She said I married money, I'm used to wearing pearls
But I've always dreamed of being just a good ol' boys' girl
So tonight I left those crystal candle lights to live a dream
And partner, there's a tiger in these tight fitting jeans

We danced every dance and Lord the beer that we went through
I'm satisfied I did my best to make her dream come true
As she played out her fantasy before my eyes it seemed
A cowgirl came alive inside those tight fitting jeans

In my mind she's still a lady, that's all I'm gonna say
I knew that I'd been broken by the time we parted ways
And I know I held more woman than most eyes have ever seen
That night I knew a lady wearing tight fitting jeans

Well now she's back in her world and I'm still stuck in mine
But I know she'll always remember the time
A cowboy once had a millionaire's dream
And Lord I love that lady wearing tight fitting jeans
