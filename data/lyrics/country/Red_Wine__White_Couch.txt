My-y-y hands are shaking
My-y-y heart is racing
Don't know what I-I-I-I-I am thinking
I'm freaking

Loving you is like drinking red wine on a white couch
So stupid like I'm shaving with the lights out
Boy, you're making me so nervous
Yeah, you're perfect, I'm a smart girl
Oh, I don't even know how
You got me walking on a tight rope with stilettos
Counting all my money in the wind blow
Boy, you're making me so nervous, is it worth it?
Yeah, I gotta be careful loving you now
'Cause you're like drinking red wine, red wine on a white couch

My heart don't understand it
Baby, you could do permanent damage
And I could end up standing in a blue dress
In a mess all in a panic screaming, "Damn it"

Loving you is like drinking red wine on a white couch
So stupid like I'm shaving with the lights out
Boy, you're making me so nervous
Yeah, you're perfect, I'm a smart girl
Oh, I don't even know how
You got me walking on a tight rope with stilettos
Counting all my money in the wind blow
Boy, you're making me so nervous, is it worth it?
Yeah, I gotta be careful loving you now
'Cause you're like drinking red wine, red wine on a white couch
Loving you is like drinking red wine on a white couch
So stupid like I'm shaving with the lights out
Boy, you're making me so nervous
Yeah, you're perfect, I'm a smart girl
Oh, I don't even know how
You got me walking on a tight rope with stilettos
Counting all my money in the wind blow
Boy, you're making me so nervous, is it worth it?
Yeah, I gotta be careful loving you now
Yeah, I gotta be careful loving you now

Gotta be careful loving you now
Careful loving you
Careful loving you
