Why does beer have to taste so good
But too much makes you feel so bad
Why are some days empty hooks
And some days its every other casts
Is there a shooter on the grassy knoll?
Where did D.B Cooper go?
Hell, where do socks in the dryer go?
I guess some things you ain't meant to know like

How you look even better in the morning
Wrapped up laying in my bed
How I did it, just don't get it
I look at you and just shake my head
Cause out of seven billion people on the planet
Never understand it, how you ended up with me girl
It's just one of those mysteries of the world

If you'd had told me the night we met
I'd be sitting right here tonight
Watching you slip into that dress
I'd said "you're out of your damn mind"
Here I am and honey there you go
Blowing my mind again
Yeah I guess it just goes to show
Some things don't make no sense

How you look even better in the morning
Wrapped up laying in my bed
How I did it, just don't get it
I look at you and just shake my head
Cause out of seven billion people on the planet
Never understand it, how you ended up with me girl
It's just one of those mysteries of the world
Just one of those mysteries of the world
Cause out of seven billion people on the planet
Never understand it

How you look even better in the morning
Wrapped up laying in my bed
How I did it, just don't get it
I look at you and just shake my head
Cause out of seven billion people on the planet
Never understand it, how you ended up with me girl
It's just one of those mysteries of the world
Just one of those mysteries of the world, yeah
