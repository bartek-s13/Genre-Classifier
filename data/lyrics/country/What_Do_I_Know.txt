I was surprised to see your name pop up on my phone
I'm glad you're alright
That you met a nice guy and you moved on
I don't wanna push to far
You don't sound as good as you say you are

What do I know?
I'm just a guy who spent a lot of his time beside you late at night
Who could pick the sound of you breathin' out of a crowd
And quote your favorite movie lines
I know you cover your smile with your little white lies
And the tone of your voice when good bye means good bye
This ain't really over, ohh, but what do I know?

I can just tell ya, it's gonna wind up
It starts with a phone call, this fire's gonna melt you
The way that you melt me, then it's a fast fall
Wild ride, eyes closed, blur
Yeah baby, right back to where we were
But what do I know?

What do I know?
I'm just a guy who spent a lot of his time beside you late at night
Who could pick the sound of you breathin' out of a crowd
And quote your favorite movie lines
I know you cover your smile with your little white lies
And the tone of your voice when good bye means good bye
This ain't really over, oh, but what do I know?

You don's miss me at all, why you callin'?
I think you walked away but the feelin's went on, and on, and on, and on, and on

I'm just a guy who spent a lot of his time beside you late at night
Who could pick the sound of you breathin' out of a crowd
And quote your favorite movie lines
I know you cover your smile with your little white lies
And the tone of your voice when good bye means good bye
This ain't really over, oh, but what do I know?
What do I know?
What do I know?
