Here I am in Dallas where in the hell are you
I came here to meet you like I said I'd do
Have cowboy hats and pickup trucks made a fool of you
Here I am in Dallas where in the hell are you
Said goodbye to all my friends down at Tootsie's bar
I packed up my old suitcase and I threw it in the car
Canceled my subscription to the Music City News
'Cause you made me an offer honey I could not refuse
Here I am in Dallas woman where are you
I came here to meet you like I said I'd do
Have cowboy hats and pickup trucks made a fool of you
Here I am in Dallas woman where are you
Walked into a barroom and I laid the picture down
I asked the guy behind the bar if he'd seen you around
He said he'd didn't know the name but he's seen that face before
And I swear I heard him laughing as I walked out the door
What got me here to Dallas sure has got me down
There's something here in Dallas turned your head around
When I came here I brought my pride and just like you it's gone
And without my pride and you I can't go back home
Here I am in Dallas where in the hell are you
