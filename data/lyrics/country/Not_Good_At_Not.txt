Maybe it's your bad girl, underneath that sweet smile
Like a peek of black lace that nobody but me sees
Just a trace of all the possibilities
Maybe it's the quarter moon, maybe it's the quart of wine
That we haven't even touched yet, baby don't need it
Everything you're doing, girl is my weakness

I'm not good at not kissin' again
When you're leanin' it on in a little closer
I'm not good at not getting sidetracked
When your tank top strap's slippin' off of your shoulder
Ohhh, girl, I try to be, but I ain't that tough
I'm not good at not fallin' in love, fallin' in love, fallin' in love

You know what you're doin' girl
You know what it does to me
When you turn on that song, and turn the lights down
Baby I'm gone, before the part about you
Dancin' in slow motion with my hands on your hips
Now you got me going right where I can't resist

I'm not good at not kissin' again
When you're leanin' it on in a little closer
I'm not good at not getting sidetracked
When your tank top strap's slipping off of your shoulder
Ohh girl, I try to be, but I ain't that tough
I'm not good at not fallin' in love, fallin' in love, fallin' in love

Can't tell you no
Can't say goodbye
Can't hold a little bit back even if I tried
'Cause when I look in your eyes

I'm not good at not kissin' again
When you're leanin' it on in a little closer
I'm not good at not getting sidetracked
When your tank top strap's slipping off of your shoulder
Girl, I try to be, but I ain't that tough
I'm not good at not fallin' in love, fallin' in love, fallin' in love
