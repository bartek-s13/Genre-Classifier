(Spoken)
Back in the innocent days
There was a young Cowboy
Who was in love with a Mexican girl
Only she didn't know it
And he would watch her when she walked back
In the cotton dress which danced in the wind
And her eyes held the stars
Now, she was the most beautiful thing that cowboy had ever seen
Sent down straight from heaven
But he was afraid he would never win her heart
Cause of some family scars left by the rain forest
But oww... how he loved her
Senorita passing by
Pardon me if I stop and ask you why
Senorita, could it be?
Someone like you could love someone like me?

So he walked up to her
Tipped his hat and introduced himself
And she looked up at him and didn't know what to say
So he told her the story of his family
The trouble that brought the barbed wire
And all the things that he couldn't change
And then he told her that he loved her
And he studied her reaction
And by the time the spring rains came
They were married
Now, there's an ol' song
That my family used to sing
'Bout a young cowboy and a mexican girl
And how they fell in love
Senorita passing by
Pardon me if I stop and ask you why
Senorita, could it be?
Someone like you could love someone like me
Senoritra passing by
Pardon me if I stop and ask you why
Senorita, could it be?
Someone like you could love someone like
Someone like you could love someone like me
