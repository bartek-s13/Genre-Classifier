When I was young I dreamed of being famous
But through the years I left that dream behind
It's funny how things in life can change us
Like when I see her little hand in mine
I still want to move mountains
I still wanna change the world
And show her no matter what happens
She's my little girl
And love lasts forever
And she'll never
Get too big for Daddy's hugs
What she sees in me
That's what I wanna be
When she grows up
I can't fly even if I try forever
But in her eyes I am Superman
Cause just one kiss could make a skinned up knee all better
And she smiles and says you're my hero, Dad
I still want to move mountains
I still wanna change the world
And show her no matter what happens
She's my little girl
And love lasts forever
And she'll never
Get too big for Daddy's hugs
What she sees in me
That's what I wanna be
When she grows up, oh
I still want to move mountains
I still wanna change the world
And show her no matter what happens
She's my little girl
And love lasts forever
She'll never
Get too big for Daddy's hugs
What she sees in me
That's what I wanna be
Oh, what she sees in me
That's what I wanna be
When she grows up
When she grows up
