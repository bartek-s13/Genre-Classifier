A threadbare alibi.....a lifetime full of promise
Fell from my Mary's eyes as she saw the screen door swing
The baby never woke......he lay cradled in her trembling
He lay safe and never knowing what my leavin would bring
I draw my pay down on the docks.....I send it off to Mary
I might hold back a dollar to wash this pain out of my back
But the pain keeps getting clearer and Mary your face just keeps on fading
Now the light shines through this bottle....memories all fade to black
(Chorus)
Well I'll see you out on the street tonight
I'm a lover of a drink, a lover of a fight
Hold my own on the dark side of this town
Yes, I'm tough as nails, got a heart of steel
I will never fear, for I will never feel
And one more round would surely set me right
I miss my Mary tonight
They call me the old man in this bar, sleeves rolled up and showin
Faint blue souvenirs of love and places I have been
One says "US Navy" and this one says "Darling Mary"
Now my Mary's turned to ashes and the ocean's turned to gin
(Repeat Chorus)
And one more round would surely set me right
I miss my Mary tonight
