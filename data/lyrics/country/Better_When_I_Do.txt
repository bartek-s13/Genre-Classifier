I don't always have to take those backroads
When it's quicker on a paved four-lane
I don't have to have my hand out the window
Ooh, just ridinfg that way
I don't always have to crack me a cold one
At 5 o' clock when the work day ends
And girl, I don't have to be holdin'gyou
When the sun sets

But it's better when I do
Have you sitting right next to me, girl
When you're in it, it's a better view
Life's more than a little sweeter
With something so pretty to hold onto
Girl, if I had it my way
You'd be right beside me
From Friday to Friday
I don't have to end off my days wrapped up kissing on you
But it's better when I do

I don't have to turn my hat round backwards
When the ball game's on the line
And I don't have to drink the first cup of coffee
On the porch outside
I don't have to speed into those hard turns
Ain't gotta play with that little white line
Just so you lean over a little bit closer
Onto my side
But it's better when I do
Have you sitting right next to me, girl
When you're in it, it's a better view
Life's more than a little sweeter
With something so pretty to hold onto
Girl, if I had it my way
You'd be right beside me
From Friday to Friday
I don't have to end off my days wrapped up kissing on you
But it's better when I do

Girl, it's better when I do
It's better when I do have you
Hanging on my arm
Wish every day could end
And every day could start with you
Just like this
And I don't always get to

But it's better when I do
Have you sitting right next to me, girl
When you're in it, it's a better view
Life's more than a little sweeter
With something so pretty to hold onto
Girl, if I had it my way
You'd be right beside me
From Friday to Friday
I don't have to end off my days wrapped up kissing on you
But it's better when I do
Yeah yeah
Oh, it's better when I do
