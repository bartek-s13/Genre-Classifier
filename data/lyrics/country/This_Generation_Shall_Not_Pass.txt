A cryin' man prays for a peace in his land then raises his arm and closes his hand
To strike the face of the woman he wed children the number one prophet said
This generation shall not pass till all these things will be fulfilled and done
This generation shall not pass before that great day come
The man on the mountain said this last days would bring
Failing up hearts the downfall of kings
Hurt waits in wars and phantoms will spread children the number one prophet said
This generation shall not pass...
When the green leaves cover the big tree of life then understand that summer is nigh
Beware of the world it's blind and it's deaf children the number one prophet said
This generation shall not pass...
This generation shall not pass...
