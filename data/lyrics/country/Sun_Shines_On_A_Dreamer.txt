She blew in from out of town
Georgia tags and a rag top down
Turning heads in the neighborhood
Half downhome, Half Hollywood… looking good
She had two months rent in rolled up cash
A blue tick hound that she called Nash
Sent a postcard home with an ocean view
Just got here Momma I miss you
When she prays every night
And when she wakes every morning
The sun shines on a dreamer
Shines a light on you when you listen to your heart
The sun shines on a dreamer
Shines a light on you through the dim, through the dark
She met Joe at the Grocery
Late one night in aisle three
Standing next to the refried beans
Shining through his old blue jeans
Well hello is all it took
And they rambled on down the road
The sun shines on a dreamer
Shines a light on you when you listen to your heart
The sun shines on a dreamer
Shines a light on you through the dim, through the dark
They climbed onto the carousel
Now they’re sitting up there on top of the world
Arms wide open to the sky
Yeah you gotta dream if you wanna fly
Yeah you gotta dream if you wanna fly
The sun shines on a dreamer
Shines a light on you when you listen to your heart
The sun shines on a dreamer
Shines a light on you through the dim, through the dark
