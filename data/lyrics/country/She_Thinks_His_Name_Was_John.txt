She can account for all of the men in her past
Where they are now
Who they married
How many kids they have
She knew their backgrounds
Family and friends
A few she even talks to now and then
But there is one she can't put her finger on
There is one who never leaves her thoughts
And she thinks his name was John
A chance meeting
A party a few years back
Broad shoulders and blue eyes
His hair was so black
He was a friend of friend you could say
She let his smile just sweep her away
And in her heart
She knew that it was wrong
But too much wine
And she left his bed at dawn
And she thinks his name was John
Now each day is one day that's left in her life
She won't know love, have a marriage or sing lullabies
She lays all alone and cries herself to sleep
Because she let a stranger kill her hopes and her dreams
And all her friends say what a pity what a loss
And in the end when she was barely hanging on
All she could say was she thinks his name was John
And she thinks his name was John
