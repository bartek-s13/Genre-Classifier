I'm not the devil you think that I am
It ain't no excuse, but I'm just a man
I slipped and I fell, it got outta hand
But I'm not the devil you think that I am
It wasn't no gun they held to my head
I got caught up believing in lies that were said
And in a moment of weakness
I stumbled and I made my bed
I'm not the devil you think that I am
It ain't no excuse, but I'm just a man
I slipped and I fell, it got outta hand
But I'm not the devil you think that I am

There's 10,000 reasons for you not to stay
And no one would blame you
If you want it that way
It might take some time
But I'll show you that I'm worth the wait
I'm not the devil you think that I am
It ain't no excuse, but I'm just a man
I slipped and I fell, it got outta hand
But I'm not the devil you think that I am
And I'll spend forever, do all that I can
To prove I'm not the devil you think that I am
And I'm not the devil
