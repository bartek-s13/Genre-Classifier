When my soul was disturbed with sorrow
When My heart was burdened with sin
Jesus opened His arms of mercy
And tenderly took me in
There is peace in the time of trouble
There is peace in the midst of a storm
There is peace though the world be raging
In the shelter of His arms
Though the world all around be raging
And it's filled with many alarms
Trust in Jesus and He will keep you
In the shelter of His arms
