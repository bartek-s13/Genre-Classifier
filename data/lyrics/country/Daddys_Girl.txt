I recall the night that you came into this world
I couldn't believe the doctor when he said: 'It's a little girl.'
I said: 'Now Doc, you must be wrong. You see I want a boy.'
Then he laid you in my arms and my heart sang with joy
(Daddy's Girl, Daddy's Girl
(I'm the centre of Daddy's world
(I know I'm Daddy's number one
(For he loves me like I was his son
(Daddy's Girl.)
I recall the day I took you to a baseball game
You brought along your baby doll and half its' baby things
We sat there a-playin' house, while the Dodgers played the Braves
And ev'ryone in the bleachers looked at us as if to say
(Daddy's Girl, Daddy's Girl
(I'm the centre of Daddy's world
(I know I'm Daddy's number one
(For he loves me like I was his son
(Daddy's Girl.)
I recall the day I took you on a fishin' trip
You said: 'Daddy won't that hook hurt the fishes' lip?'
And you said if they don't get air, those things in the can will die
So we turned the worms all loose and chased some butterflies
(Daddy's Girl, Daddy's Girl
(I'm the centre of Daddy's world
(I know I'm Daddy's number one
(For he loves me like I was his son
(Daddy's Girl.)
I recall the day that your young man come to call
Seems like only yesterday, you swam and played football
But I know the time has come, that I must set you free
But no matter where you are, you know what you are to me
(Daddy's Girl, Daddy's Girl
(I'm the centre of Daddy's world
(I know I'm Daddy's number one
(For he loves me like I was his son
(Daddy's Girl.)
To fade
(Daddy's Girl, Daddy's Girl
(I'm the centre of Daddy's world
(I know I'm Daddy's number one
(For he loves me like I was his son
(Daddy's Girl.)
