One thing 'bout this heart of mine
All my hurts got a mending time
It dont leave no scars behind
I'll get over you
I'll find me a guy one day
Who's not scared to give his heart away
When I do
It's safe to say that I'll get over you
I'll get over you
I'll get through it when I do
I'll be good as new
When I get over you
From now on think
I'll lay low
I'll talk fast
But I'll move slow
You taught me all I need to know
'Bout gettin over you
Sometimes I think I love you still
Wonder if I always will
But I know it's just untill I get over you
I'll get over you
I'll get through it when I do
I'll be good as new
When I get over you
Sometimes think I love you still
Wonder if I always will
Love for you's so hard to kill
But I'll get over you
I'll get over you
I'll get through it when I do
I'll be good as new
When I get over you
I'll get over you
I'll get through it when I do
I'll be good as new
When I get over you
I'll get over you
I'll get through it when I do
I'll be good as new
When I get over you
I'll get over you
I'll get through it when I do
I'll be good as new
When I get over you
