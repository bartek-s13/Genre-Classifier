Blue
Oh, so lonesome for you
Why can't you be blue over me?
Blue
Oh, so lonesome for you
Tears fill my eyes
'Til I can't see

Three o'clock in the morning
Here am I
Sitting here so lonely
So lonesome I could cry

Blue
Oh, so lonesome for you
Why can't you be blue over me?

Now that it's over
I realize
Those weak words you whispered
Were nothing but lies

Blue
Oh, so lonesome for you
Why can't you be blue over me?
Why can't you be blue over me?
