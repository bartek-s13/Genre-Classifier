I've been digging down deep, hands on the shovel
Looking for a light at the end of the tunnel
I’ve been drawing out maps, turning stones over
Trying to find a field full of four-leaf clovers

These shots in the dark are just shots to my heart
Leaving scars in the heart of my soul
Don't know where to start, I just need to spark
That feeling I used to know

I, wanna ride like a rebel way out on the wire
I, I ain't gonna settle till I burn up the tires
Just wanna feel, something that’s real
I'll keep looking lower and higher
Trying to find my fire, fire

Lit love like a match, fired up for a minute
Let it go up in smoke when my heart wasn't in it
This playing it safe, it's a safe way to play
If you never jump in or let go
What the hell does it mean if you can't feel the heat?
If it doesn't burn outta control
I, wanna ride like a rebel way out on the wire
I, I ain't gonna settle till I burn up the tires
Just wanna feel, something that's real
I’ll keep looking lower and higher
Trying to find my fire
Trying to find my fire
I, wanna ride like a rebel way out on the wire
I, I ain’t gonna settle till I burn up the tires
Just wanna feel, something that's real
I’ll keep looking lower and higher
Trying to find my fire, fire
Fire, fire
