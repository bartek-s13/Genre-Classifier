Day One
I stumbled through hello on 5th Avenue
Day Two
We grabbed a bite to eat and talked all afternoon
Caught a movie on Day Fourteen
And Day Sixty-Seven she said "I love you" to me
Chorus:
Oh, what a feeling
What a wonderful emotion
Yeah, what a life
Counting my blessings and knowing...
Ooh we had our ups and downs
All along the way
She had a chance to leave, but chose to stay
What a beautiful day
What a beautiful day
Day One Sixteen
I asked her what she was doing for the rest of my life
Day One Eighty Nine
Oh, I almost lost that girl to my foolish pride
But she said "I do" on day Four Eighty Two
And gave me a son on day Seven Sixty One
Oh, what a feeling
What a wonderful emotion
Yeah, what a life
Counting my blessings and knowing...
Ooh we had our ups and downs
All along the way
She had a chance to leave, but chose to stay
What a beautiful day
Day Eighteen Thousand Two Hundred and Fifty Three
Well, Honey that's fifty years
Yeah, here's to you and me
Oh, what a feeling
What a wonderful emotion
Yeah, what a life
Counting my blessings and knowing...
Ooh we had our ups and downs
All along the way
She had a chance to leave, but chose to stay
What a beautiful day
What a beautiful day
Day One, I thank God I said "Hello" on 5th Avenue
