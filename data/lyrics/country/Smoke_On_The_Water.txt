There will be a sad day comin'
For the foes of all mankind
They must answer to the people
And it’s troubling their mind
Everybody who must fear them
Will rejoice on that great day
When the powers of dictators
Shall be taken all away

There’ll be smoke on the water
On the land and the sea
When our Army and Navy overtakes the enemy
There’ll be smoke on the mountains
Where the Heathen Gods stay
And the sun that is risin’
Will go down on that day
For there is a great destroyer
Made of fire and flesh and steel
Rollin’ toward the foes of freedom
They’ll go down beneath its wheels
There’ll be nothing left but vultures
To inhabit all that land
When our modern ships and bombers
Make a graveyard of Japan

Hirohito ‘long with Hitler
Will be ridin’ on a rail
Mussolini’ll beg for mercy
As a leader he has failed
But there’ll be no time for pity
When the Screamin’ Eagle flies
That will be the end of Axis
They must answer with their lives
