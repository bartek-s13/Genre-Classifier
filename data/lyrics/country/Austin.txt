These sleepin' pills ain't workin' for me
I'm wide awake talkin' to these naked walls
They ain't got to much to say, and i get tired
And my mind goes out the gutter
Past and present run together, kinda like they used to
And i can't believe your not alone
Happy as hell and done moved on
Heard he's a banker down in Austin
I thought you always hated it there
Write me a letter or answer your phone just
Don't make me believe these things
I can't believe
It's 4 a.m
You never answer this late
If you do it's unexpected
If you do it turns out great
But only for a little while
Until you realize what you've done
Until you see that mornin' sun
You always tuck your tail and you start to run
I can't believe your not alone
Happy as hell and done moved on
And i can't believe you're south of Austin
When you told me that you hated it there
Write me a letter or answer your phone just
Don't make me believe these things
I can't believe
And i can't believe that your not at home
Happy as hell and done moved on
I can't believe your leavin' Austin
I know you always hated it there
Write me a letter or answer your phone just
Don't make me believe these things
I can't believe
Cause i can't believe that your not at home
Happy as hell and done moved on
I can't believe your leavin' Austin
I knew you always hated it there
Write me a letter or answer your phone just
Don't make me believe these things
I can't believe
Don't make me believe these things
I can't believe
I can't believe
