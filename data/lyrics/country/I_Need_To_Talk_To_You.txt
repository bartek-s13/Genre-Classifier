The whole town would be talking
If someone saw you in here with me
I'm telling you I'd understand
If you feel you need to leave
This room rents by the hour
Oh but I've got it all night long
This is the first time that I've asked you here
It ain't the first time that I've done wrong
I need to talk to you
I need to know your words are true
Don't just tell me, show me, give me, all that I need
I need to talk to you
Those pills there on the nightstand
They help make me believe
That the man I'm laying down with
Really cares for me
This book you see me holding
I usually hide in the drawer
I've done my best to put you away
I can't hide from you anymore
I need to talk to you
I need to know your words are true
Don't just tell me, show me, give me, all that I need
I need to talk to you
Oh, I've spent my whole life regretting
Each day that I've spent before
It's time that I face the things that I've done
Oh and that's what I came here for
Cause I need to talk to you
I need to know your words are true
Don't just tell me, show me, give me, all that I need
I need to talk to you
I need to talk to you
