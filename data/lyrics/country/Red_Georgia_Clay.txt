One rainy night in Dalton they were talkin' in the bar
About two bodies they'd been searching for
Behind old Samson's sawmill, the blood hounds found their grave
They were layin' in that red Georgia clay
So I just sit and listen, and drank my whiskey down
I knew I'd never make it out of town
When a big hand grabbed my shoulder, I started shakin' in my boots
And I knew the time had come to tell the truth
I said I followed them one evening when the sun was sinkin' low
I knew that loggin' shack was where they'd go
But when I watched 'em love together, it was more than I could take
So I left them layin' in that red Georgia clay
I may be hungry, cold and lonely in this ol' prison cell
And when I die I guess I'll go to hell
But at least I know she won't be runnin' 'round on me today
'Cause they're layin' in the red Georgia clay
Arm and arm together, they both wanted it that way
So I left them layin' in that Red Georgia clay
Yeah, I left them layin' in that Red Georgia clay
