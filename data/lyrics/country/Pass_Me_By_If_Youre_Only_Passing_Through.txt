Would you look at what came down the road today?
Wanting me to be one more mistake to make
A bridge to burn to get to some one new
Hey pass me by if you're only passing through

You sure look like the traveling kind to me
Don't stop if this ain't where you want to be
Now I don't know what you think you run into
Hey pass me by if you're only passing through

I'm not going to be a steeping stone
Among the other hearts that you walk on
Lord help me if I fall in love with you
Hey pass me by if you're only passing through
Hey pass me by if you're only passing through
