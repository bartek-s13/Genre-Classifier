West bound and down, eighteen wheels are rollin'
We're gonna do what they say can't be done
We've got a long way to go and a short time to get there
I'm west bound, just watch ol' "Bandit" run

Keep your foot hard on the pedal. Son, never mind them brakes
Let it all hang out 'cause we got a run to make
The boys are thirsty in Atlanta and there's beer in Texarcana
And we'll bring it back no matter what it takes

West bound and down, eighteen wheels are rollin'
We're gonna do what they say can't be done
We've got a long way to go and a short time to get there
I'm west bound, just watch ol' "Bandit" run


West bound and down, eighteen wheels are rollin'
We're gonna do what they say can't be done
We've got a long way to go and a short time to get there
I'm west bound, just watch ol' "Bandit" run

Ol' Smokey's got them ears on, he's hot on your trail
And he ain't gonna rest 'til you're in jail
So you got to dodge 'im and you got to duck 'im
You got to keep that diesel truckin'
Just put that hammer down and give it hell

West bound and down, eighteen wheels are rollin'
We're gonna do what they say can't be done
We've got a long way to go and a short time to get there
I'm west bound, just watch ol' "Bandit" run
