Well, I can feel your heartbeat when your lying by my side
I can see foever when I look into your eyes
Each day beside you, girl you take my breath away
Right here in your arms is where I wanna stay
It's the way that you look girl
When you're reading late at night
It's the way that your body feels
When you're lying by my side
A love like ours, it can't be built in a million dreams
It's just you and me and girl, you're all I need
Watching you walk in
Yeah, you're dancing through your world
Got your heart on my hands 'cause you're daddy's bittle girl
Baby, I've loved you from our very first hello
At first, you stole my heart, baby, here's my soul
It's the way that you look girl
When you're readying late at night
It's the way that your body feels
When you're lying by my side
A love like ours, it can't be built in a million dreams
It's just you and me and girl, you're all I need
I never knew love could be so sweet
I never knew, girl, that you could love me
But I'll spend each day just to make your dreams come true
'Cause it's just you and me
Baby, it's me and you
It's the way that you look girl
When you're reading late at night
It's the way that your body feels
When you're lying by my side
A love like ours, it can't be built in a million dreams
It's just you and me and girl, you're all I need
It's just you and me, baby
It's you and me, darlin'
Its you and me and girl your all i need
