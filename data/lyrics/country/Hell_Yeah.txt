He works way too much for way too little
He drinks way too early till way too late
He hasn't had a raise since New Year's Day
In eighty-eight gets trampled on by everyone
Except when he comes in here
And he's the product of the Haggard generation
He's got a redneck side when you get him agitated
He got the gold toothed look from a stiff right hook
He's proud he took for his right wing stand on Vietnam
Says he lost his brother there
He yells out Johnny Cash
And the band starts to play
A ring of fire as he walks up
And stands there by the stage
And he says

Hell yeah!
Turn it up!
Right on!
Hell yeah!
Sounds good!
Sing that song!
Guitar man playin' all night long
Take me back to where the music hit me
Life was good and love was easy

She's got an MBA and a plush corner office
She's got a don't mess with me attitude
She'll close a deal she don't reveal that she can feel
The loneliness the emptiness
Except when she comes in here
She's the product of the Me generation
She's got a rock and roll side when you get her agitated
She got the tattoo there on her derriere from a spring break dare
In Panama where love was all she thought she'd ever need
She yells out to the band
Know any Bruce Springsteen
Then she jumps up on the bar
And she, and she starts to scream
She says

Hell yeah!
Turn it up!
Right on!
Hell yeah!
Sounds good!
Sing that song!
Guitar man playin' all night long
Take me back to where the music hit me
When life was good and love was easy

Yeah, yeah
Can or can't you get my mind off thinkin' 'bout
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Hey, hell yeah

Hell yeah
Turn it up
Right on
Hell yeah
Sounds good
Sing that song
Guitar man playin' all night long
Take me back to where the music hit me
When life was good

Hell yeah!
Turn it up!
Right on!
Hell yeah!
Sounds good!
Sing that song!
Guitar man playin' all night long
Take me back to where the music hit me
When life was good and love was easy
