Well you know I really love you
But this wild road has got a hold of me
I gotta go but you’re always with me
I feel you close when I close my eyes
I hear your voice it’s like you’re by my side
Wish you were here but I know you can’t be
So here’s what I’m gonna do
I’m gonna bring it back home to you
More than a postcard
Better than a photograph
You’re gonna see what I mean when get I make it back
I’ll pick a different colored flower every field that I pass
And bring ‘em back home to you
I breathe it in
Soak it up
Write it down for ya
I’ll even catch some mountain air in a jar for ya
I’ll pick a different colored flower every field that I pass
And bring ‘em back home to you
Well you should see the color that the sky gets
Right before it fades into a sunset
That endless sky shines on forever
Over the fields and through the mountains
I’m looking for it and I’ve found it
Such a sight another perfect moment
More than a postcard
Better than a photograph
You’re gonna see what I mean when I make it back
I’ll pick a different colored flower every field that I pass
And bring ‘em back home to you
I breathe it in
Soak it up
Write it down for ya
I’ll even catch some mountain air in a jar for ya
I’ll pick a different colored flower every field that I pass
And bring ‘em back home to you
More than a postcard
Better than a photograph
You’re gonna see what I mean when I make it back
I’ll pick a different colored flower every field that I pass
And bring ‘em back home to you
I breathe it in
Soak it up
Write it down for ya
I’ll even catch some mountain air in a jar for ya
I’ll pick a different colored flower every field that I pass
And bring ‘em back home to you
