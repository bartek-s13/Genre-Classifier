I told Mary about us
I told her about our great sin
Mary cried and forgave me
And Mary took me back again
Said if I wanted my freedom
I could be free evermore
But I don't want to be, and I don't want to see
Mary cry anymore

Oh, devil woman
Devil woman, let go of me
Devil woman, let me be
And leave me alone
I want to go home

Mary is waitin' and weepin'
Down in our shack by the sea
Even after I've hurt her
Mary' still in love with me
Devil woman it's over
Trapped no more by your charms
Cause I don't want to stay, I want to get away
Woman let go of my arm
Oh, devil woman
Devil woman, let go of me
Devil woman, let me be
And leave me alone
I want to go home

Devil woman you're evil
Like the dark coral reef
Like the winds that bring high tides
You bring sorrow and grief
You made me ashamed to face Mary
Barely had the strength to tell
Skies are not so black, Mary took me back
Mary has broken your spell

Oh, devil woman
Devil woman, let go of me
Devil woman, let me be
And leave me alone
I want to go home

Runnin' along by the seashore
Runnin' as fast as I can
Even the seagulls are happy
Glad I'm coming home again
Never again will I ever
Cause another tear to fall
Down the beach I see, what belongs to me
The one I want most of all
Oh, devil woman, devil woman
Don't follow me
Devil woman, let me be
And leave me alone
I'm going back home
