Mirror mirror on the wall who's the saddest of them all
But I don't have to see I know it's gotta be me
Every time the wind blows at my window I rush to see if it's you at my door
And the sadness fill the rooms when you're not standin' there
And I wish that I could walk right through the floor
Mirror mirror on the wall...
Every night in dreams you torment me as I remember things I should forget
And the sun comes up by and a new day's dawnin'
But nothing's changed for I still love you yet
Mirror mirror on the wall...
