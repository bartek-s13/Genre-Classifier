For once in my life I know the meaning of happiness
And what it means to have a dream come true
Cause every day I wake up singing livin' on the sunshine love is bringing
And it's wonderful knowin' that I owe it all to you
At last I've got a reason to be a living
I'm at the end of the rainbow and the gold is in my hands
Your love is so sweet I can't refuse it heaven help me if I ever lose it
Cause my whole world's just knowing you're my man
I don't understand you but God knows I love you you're my man
I feel so safe when I'm in your arms cause you're all man
You're heaven on earth and so dependable
Together we're a team that's just unbendable
I want the whole wide world to know you're my man
At last I've got a reason to be a living...
Oh my whole world's just knowing you're my man my man my man
