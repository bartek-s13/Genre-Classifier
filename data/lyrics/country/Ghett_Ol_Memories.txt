Remember sittin' on the front porch (Front porch)
Gunshots at the backdoor (Backdoor)
I hear the wind and the skies a-cryin' (Cryin')
Honeysuckles on the trees are dyin' (Dyin')
Rockin' chairs with my nana (Nana)
Though, I never knew my grandpa (I missed him, grandpa)
Catchin' lightning bugs at night (At night)
But I was never satisfied ('Fied)

I couldn't wait 'til the sun would set (Sun would set)
So we could do it over again (Over again)
And when the morning came
I heard the sirens ringin' from my bed (From my bed)

It was all in my head (Head)
All in my head (Head)
Yeah (Yeah)
Those good ol' memo– good old memories
It was all in my head
Ghetto ol' memories

Freeze cups in the summer (Summer)
No drinkin' after nine o'clock
Sugar straws with the Big League bubble gum
Then we mixed it with some Pop Rocks (Pop Rocks)
Baseball in the front yard (Front yard)
In-a-hawk was my favorite sport
Who remember "Get outside"? (Get outside)
'Cause the TV screen was only reserve for the grown folks

I couldn't wait 'til the sun would set
So we can do it over again
Oh, when the morning came
I heard those sirens ringin' from my bed

It was all in my head
All in my head
Yeah (Yeah)
Those good ol' memo– good old memories
It was all in my head
Ghetto ol' memories
