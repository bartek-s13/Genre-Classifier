The sunlight through a broken window pane
Moves across a worn down hardwood floor
The evening brings a thunder and the rain
Nothing like the cold after the storm

You are everything I ever wanted
And I am more than you bargained for
Forever is the echo of a promise
Broken by the slamming of a door

Stronger than the whiskey
Burning higher than the flames
The fire in your touch is like a needle in my veins
And I might be the death of you
But you love me just the same
Every chance we've had to say goodbye
Is one more chance to stay

So kiss you once to show you that I want you
And twice to show you why I will not let go
And when you are lost out in the darkness
I will be the light to guide you home

Stronger than the whiskey
Burning higher than the flames
The fire in your touch is like a needle in my veins
And you might be the death of me
But I love you just the same
Every chance we've had to say goodbye
Is one more chance to stay

Sometimes late at night when you are sleeping
I watch the moonlight drift across your face
I thank the Lord for sending you to keep me
To catch me should I ever fall from grace

Stronger than the whiskey
Burning higher than the flames
The fire in your touch is like a needle in my veins
And I might be the death of you
But you love me just the same
Every chance we've had to say goodbye
Is one more chance to stay
Oh every chance we've had to say goodbye
Is one more chance to stay
