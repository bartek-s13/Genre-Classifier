I always tried to tell myself that you don't make me blue
I lay and cry and still deny the fickle things you do
I oughta run so far away I'll never see the light of day
I oughta go but I gotta stay with you cause I'm so in love with you
All my friends are telling me you're breaking up our home
They say that I should say goodbye and leave you all alone
But there ain't nobody telling me a doggone thing that I can see
I oughta go but I gotta be with you cause I'm so in love with you
I guess you really got me hooked you know I'm really gone
You wake and sigh and smile and lie and string me right along
Your fickle heart will break my home I know you reap the things you sown
But I just can't leave the love I've known with you cause I'm so in love with you
I know that you've been stepping out and swinging high and wide
You made the rounds all over town you didn't tried to hide
You're gonna pay I have no doubt your sin will surely find you out
I oughta laugh when it's turned about with you but I'm so in love with you
