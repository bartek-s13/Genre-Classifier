I walked one day along a country road
And there a stranger journeyed too
Bent low beneath the burden of his load
It was the cross, the cross I knew
Take up Thy cross and follow me
I hear the blessed Saviour call
How can I make a lesser sacrifice
When Jesus gave his all
I cried Lord Jesus, and He spoke my name
I saw His hands all bruised and torn
I stooped to kiss away the marks of shame
The shame for me that He had born
Take up Thy cross and follow me
I hear the blessed Saviour call
How can I make a lesser sacrifice
When Jesus gave his all
