Weather man said, it痴 gonna snow
By now I should, be used to the cold

Mid-February shouldn稚 be so scary
It was only December
I still remember the presents, the tree, you and me

But you went away
How dare you?
I miss you
They say I値l be OK
But I知 not going to ever get over you

Living alone, here in this place
I think of you, and I知 not afraid

Your favorite records make me feel better
Cause you sing along
With every song
I know you didn稚 mean to give them to me
But you went away
How dare you?
I miss you
They say I値l be OK
But I知 not going to ever get over you

It really sinks in, you know, when I see it in stone

Cause you went away
How dare you?
I miss you
They say I値l be OK
But I知 not going to ever get over you
