I don’t want to talk it over one more time
No there’s not much use in talkin’
If you’ve made up your mind
And darlin’ I don’t need to tell you why

You know that I’m not that good at goodbye

Please don’t tell me you’re leavin’ if you go
Just let me turn my head while you walk out the door
‘Cause if I see you leavin’ I will die


Lord goodbyes just make it harder anyhow
So if you really feel like leavin’ do it now
And let me keep a little of my pride


I don’t want to know you’re leavin’ when you go
‘Cause if we reach the part where you’re standin’ at the door
Well I know I’d just break down again and cry
