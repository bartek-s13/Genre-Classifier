It wasn't the two for ones
That made the hour magic
It wasn't anything else
I guess that we just had it
I wasn't there to get drunk but it happened
Cause I never wanted to say goodbye
We were just friends, just hanging
Just sitting 'round waiting for somebody to cross the line

We found love in a bar
In the back of a patio corner
Away from the lights
It was us and Corona
And hearts on fire like the cigarettes you smoke
When you drink now we can't turn back
Cause the words came out
And the truth can't lie
And we've been saying it with our eyes the whole time
That you have my whole heart
Yeah, we found love in a bar

You didn't say sorry
You didn't look away
Girl, you just said what I was thinking
You weren't afraid
Yeah, we found love in a bar
In the back of a patio corner
Away from the lights
It was us and Corona
And hearts on fire like the cigarettes you smoke
When you drink now we can't turn back
Cause the words came out
And the truth can't lie
And we've been saying it with our eyes the whole time
That you have my whole heart
Yeah, we found love in a bar

We found love in a bar

And hearts on fire like the cigarettes you smoke
When you drink now we can't turn back
Cause the words came out
And the truth can't lie
And we've been saying it with our eyes the whole time
That you have my whole heart
Yeah, we found love in a bar
Yeah, we found love in a bar
