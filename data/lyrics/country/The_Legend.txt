You heard about the legend of Jesse James
John Henry just to mention some names
But there's a truck driving legend in the south today
A man called Bandit from Atlanta GA
Every gear jammer knows his name
They swear he got icewater runnin in his veins
A foot like lead and nerves like steel
He's gonna go to glory ridin 18 wheels
He left Atlanta back in '63
Haulin him a load up to Tennessee
He hit Monteagle in a driving rain
So hard he couldn't even see the passing lane
Well he started down the grade when he lost the gear
He hit them brakes found he had no air
The Monteagle grade is steep and long
And everbody that seen it thought the Bandit was gone
Well his truck jack-knifed turned completely 'round
He was coming down backwards 'bout the speed of sound
Alot of folks seen him and they all say
He had his head out the window yelling clear the way
Well he got to the bottom safe and sound
Everybody asked Bandit how he made it down
He said folks when the truck picked up too much speed
I just run along beside it and drug my feet

He's goin up to glory ridin 18 wheels
