The grey clouds have departed
The stars light up the night
Now I can see through darkness
The river shines with life
I've waded through the water
My soul is coming clean
I've held my breath forever
But now it's time to breathe
There's nothing like forgiveness
To resurrect a soul
Better to give than get it
I've been forgiven so I'm letting you know, oh
Nobody should be less than whole
So many broken people
Their hearts forget to beat
Grown numb, no one's forgiven
Go on forgive yourself
Go on forgive yourself
There's nothing like forgiveness
To resurrect a soul
Better to give than get it
I've been forgiven so I'm letting you know, oh
Nobody should be less than whole
Oh, there's nothing like forgiveness
Oh, to resurrect a soul
Better to give it yeah, than it is to get it, oh
I've been forgiven so I should know
I've been forgiven so I should know
I've been forgiven so I should know
Nobody should be less than whole
There's nothing like forgiveness
To resurrect a soul
Better to give it, yeah, than it is to get it
Give it, I've been forgiven so I'm letting you know
Nobody, nobody should be less than whole
