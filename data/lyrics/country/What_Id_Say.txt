Talking to the mirror
Whispering your name
Just like you were here, you'd think I was insane
I hold these conversations in the silence of my room
Rehearsing all the things I'd say should I run into you
How's it going might be what I'd say
You broke my heart you know
Or it looks like rain today
Or maybe god I missed you since you went away
You're looking well
Or go to hell might be what I'd say
Theres times I feel so angry I'd put my fist right through the wall
Then there's times I've come so close to giving you a call
I love you and I hate you all at the same time
I pray that you'll come back to me before I lose my mind
How's it going might be what I'd say
You broke my heart you know
Or it looks like rain today
Or maybe god I missed you since you went away
You're looking well
Or go to hell might be what I'd say
Guess you'll have to wait until that day
To find out what I'd say
God I missed you since you went away
You're looking well
Or go to hell
Might be what I'd say
