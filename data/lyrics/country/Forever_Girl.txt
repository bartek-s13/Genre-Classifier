She’s dancing in a field
A flower in her hair
Sitting on my tailgate
I can’t help but stare
Summer sun is shining
On her tan skin
I can feel her love
Blowing like the wind
Yes I can
We head out to the lake
Feet hanging off the dock
And talking everything
Sharing every little thought
We take a dip in the water
As the sun sits on down
Ain’t nothing like her wet hair
And the crickets sound
It’s a glass of wine to keep her sane
And I love the sound of her full name
Natural southern beauty
Can’t explain what it does to me
She’s everything in my whole world
That’s my forever girl
We ride around in my truck
Singing our songs
She’s looking so damn good
With that sundress on
She slides on over
I hold her tight
And I say darling
I thank God that you’re mine
It’s a glass of wine to keep her sane
And I love the sound of her full name
Natural southern beauty
Can’t explain what it does to me
She’s everything in my whole world
That’s my forever girl
It’s a glass of wine to keep her sane
And I love the sound of her full name
Natural southern beauty
I can’t explain what it does to me
You’re everything in my whole world
That’s my forever girl
Oh yeah, that’s my forever girl
