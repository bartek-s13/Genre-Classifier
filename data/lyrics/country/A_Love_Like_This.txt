Two small town kids just dots on a map
Wound up here what's the chances of that
Sippin' the same drink same bar same night
Funny how some things turn out just right

It was a long shot kiss
It was a last call risk yeah
That's how it all happened
That's how it all started

A love like this only comes around every once in a lifetime
When it's just right
Yeah baby sounds crazy
But if fate had never stepped in
We might have missed a love like this

We said forever and I changed your name
Who would have thought we could love anything
More than this love more than this life
But now there's a little heartbeat inside

It was a long shot kiss
It was a last call risk yeah
That's how it all happened
That's how it all started
A love like this only comes around every once in a lifetime
When it's just right
Yeah baby sounds crazy
But if fate had never stepped in
We might have missed a love like this
Ohh a love like this

A love like this only comes around every once in a lifetime
Yeah
A love like this like this
Every once in a lifetime yeah yeah yeah

A love like this only comes around every once in a lifetime
When it's just right
Yeah baby sounds crazy
But if fate had never stepped in
We may have missed a love like this

Two small kids just dots on a map
Wound up here what's the chances of that
