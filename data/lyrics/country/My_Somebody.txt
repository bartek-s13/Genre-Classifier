You burning waffles in the kitchen
Laughing when the smoke alarm goes off
You overdressed in the winter
Smiling underneath a Target scarf

Do you
Remember what you told me last summer sitting in my car?
You said

Everybody needs somebody
Well baby, I don't need nobody
But the girl who's looking at me
Looking down 
Everybody needs somebody
My somebody is you

Act like you ain't afraid of nothing
But I still catch you biting your nails
You're always creeping up to crazy
But never going off the rails

And do you realise that you made it near impossible
For anybody else?
'Cause everybody needs somebody
Well baby, I don't need nobody
But the girl who's looking at me
Looking down 
Everybody needs somebody
My somebody is you

Though I'll never let you go
So baby, all I wanna know
Am I the same thing to you?
Am I your somebody too?

'Cause everybody needs somebody
Well baby, I don't need nobody
But the girl who's looking at me
Looking down 
Everybody needs somebody
My somebody is you
My somebody is you
