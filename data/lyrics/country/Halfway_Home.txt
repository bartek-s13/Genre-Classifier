Halfway Home
Well, you ain't so sure he's the one
4AM and you drive alone
With last night's clothes on
Halfway home
Tell yourself you're still strong
Wondering what's so damn wrong
With needing someone

Calling the lovelorn girls
Of Davidson County
Tired of the games
That the boys up there play
Calling the dreaming girls
Looking for a savior
He ain't gonna save you
That's just what you think his eyes say

Deep down you know
That you're worth more than this
Or the cost of that dinner last night
He'd be driving you home
If he was worth half the shit
And his daddy had raised him up right
Let me remind you
There's real love out there down the road
Right now you're just

Halfway home
Making up reasons why
Let him sleep through the kiss goodbye
Cause neither one of you care
So rinse the smoke
Out of your slept in hair
Wash your face and change those clothes
We've all been there

Calling the lovelorn girls
Of Davidson County
Tired of the games
That the boys up there play
Calling the dreaming girls
Looking for a savior
He ain't gonna save you
That's just what you think his eyes say

Deep down you know
That you're worth more than this
Or the cost of that dinner last night
He'd be driving you home
If he was worth half the shit
And his daddy had raised him up right
Let me remind you
There's real love out there down the road
Right now you're just

Halfway home
Halfway home tonight
