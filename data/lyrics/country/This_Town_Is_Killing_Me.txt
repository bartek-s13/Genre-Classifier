I pour my heart out, three minutes at a time
On a J-45, but no one's listening
They're too busy drinking on the company tab
I scream my lungs out, confess my secrets, all my sins
But they don't give a damn
'Cause if it don't sound like the radio? Pass

Nashville, you win
Your steel guitars and broken hearts have done me in
I gave you my soul, 'cause I wanted it so bad
And now I just wanna go home
This town is killing me
This town is killing me

They buried my grandad without me
Cause I was out on the road at some one off show
In Tupelo, and I can't take that one back
I was in love once and I pushed him away
And the price I pay is a whole lot of lonely nights
And a whole lot of songs that never see the light

Nashville, you win
Your steel guitars and broken hearts have done me in
I gave you my soul, 'cause I wanted it so bad
And now I just wanna go home
This town is killing me
This town is killing me
Oh this town is killing
This town is killing me
Nashville, you win
Cause I'll wake up here tomorrow, do it all over again
Even though you're killing me
Oh, this town is killing me
This town is killing me
