For my girls
The fighters, the warriors

Broken glass inside won't cut through me
Pain behind my eyes; I turn into strength

Oh, I will fight, I will survive

I'm invincible
I'm unbreakable
I'm a diamond cut to last
I'm unstoppable
I'm a hero
Like a phoenix from the ash
Whoa, whoa, whoa
(Invincible)

Cracks run through these walls, but they still stand strong, oh
Heart covered in scars, but my fear is gone

Oh, I will fight, I will survive
I'm invincible
I'm unbreakable
I'm a diamond cut to last
I'm unstoppable
I'm a hero
Like a phoenix from the ash
Whoa, whoa, whoa

Nothing's gonna make me break or shatter
No one's gonna tell me I won't matter, no
I won't let you
Time is running out, keeps getting faster
Gotta find a way, rewrite the answers
Til I can say...

I'm invincible
I'm unbreakable
I'm a diamond cut to last
I'm unstoppable
I'm a hero
Like a phoenix from the ash
I'm invincible
I'm unbreakable
I'm a diamond that will last
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Invincible
