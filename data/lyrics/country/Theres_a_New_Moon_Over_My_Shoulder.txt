There's a new moon over my shoulder
And an old love still in my heart

I remember now that I'm older
What you told me the day we had to part
You promised with the new moon
You'd be coming back to me
Many moons have passed
Still I'm waiting patiently


Now I'm wishing I had been bolder
Then perhaps we wouldn't be so far apart
You promised you would write me
But so could not a line
Still I wait and make believe
That some day you'll be mine
