One dozen roses and our love a mom and dad's prayer to you above
Happy birthday little dove one dozen roses and our love
Well today is your birthday sweetheart and you would have been sweet sixteen
Sure you were our only daughter you were your mom and your daddy's little queen
See we were gonna give you up party and everything but the Lord called you away
To sleep in his beautiful garden so we brought you this pretty bouquet
Yeah your mom is here with me you know with the roses in her hand
You know somethin' else she has your little white Bible to kinda help us understand
Oh we're gonna miss you so much precious daughter as we both kneel here to pray
But we're gonna leave you these pretty roses on this your special day
One dozen roses and our love...
