Living for tomorrow
Lost within a dream
Tryna find the answer to the question
And it seems that love makes the world feel good

Singing in the moonlight
Dancing in the rain
Let the sunshine through to lift your spirit once again
Cause love makes the world feel good

Chasing after rainbows
Somewhere in the sky

And it feels so good
Oh yeah
And it feels so good
Oh yeah
And it feels so good
Oh yeah
And it feels so good
Oh yeah
And it feels so good

Riding on the river
Of hearts that beat as one
This feels like forever and we've only just begun
Cause love makes the world feel good

Holding on the memories
Cause smiles are still alive
Looking to the future and there's happiness in sight
Cause love makes the world feel good

Walking through my past life
Where the days are full of joy

And it feels so good
Oh yeah
And it feels so good
Oh yeah
And it feels so good
Oh yeah
And it feels so good
Oh yeah
And it feels so good


The Candyman can cause he mixes it with love and makes the world taste good
