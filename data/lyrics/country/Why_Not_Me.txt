You've been looking for love
All around the world
Baby, don't you know
This country girl's still free?
Why not me?
Well, you've finally come down
To your old hometown
Your Kentucky girl's been waiting patiently
Why not me?

Why not me
On a rainy day?
Why not me
To love your cares away?
Why not me?
Why not me
When the nights get cold?
Why not me
When you're growing old?
Why not me?

You've been searching
From here to Singapore
Ain't it time
That you notice the girl next door, baby
Why not me?
You had to see if the world was round
It's time that you learned
How good settling down could be
Why not me?


You've been looking for love
All around the world
Baby, don't you know
This country girl's still free?

Baby, why not me?
