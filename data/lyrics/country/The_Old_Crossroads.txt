Oh my brother take this warning
Don't let old Satan hold your hand
You'll be lost in sin forever
You'll never reach the Promised Land
The old crossroad now is waiting
Which one are you goin' to take?
One leads down to destruction
The other to the Pearly Gates
One road leads up to Heaven
The other goes down below
Jesus our Savior will protect you
He'll guide you by the old crossroad
The old crossroad now is waiting
Which one are you goin' to take?
One leads down to destruction
The other to the Pearly Gates
Soon your life will be over
You'll have to face the old crossroad
Will you be ready then my brother
To shun the one that goes down below?
The old crossroad now is waiting
Which one are you goin' to take?
One leads down to destruction
The other to the Pearly Gates
