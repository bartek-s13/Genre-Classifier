There were waves, there was sand
There were couples holding hands
Sunset silhouettes on the boardwalk
There was you, there was me, whispering I don’t wanna leave
It’s amazing how you can fast you can fall in a short time together
Girl it wasn’t forever
But we got close, close as it gets
That’s a brush with love I’ll never forget
So close, but still so far
That summer’s still got a hold of my heart
It was worth it
It was perfect
Near miss, by an inch
Almost
Girl we got close
Every once in a while I’ll catch a flash of a smile
And it takes me right back to yours
And the salt from your kiss is back on my lips
And we’re wrapped in a blanket on the shore
If it weren’t for them flash lights
We’d have gone further that night
But we got close, close as it gets
That’s a brush with love I’ll never forget
So close, but still so far
That summer’s still got a hold of my heart
It was worth it
It was perfect
Near miss, by an inch
Almost
Girl we got close
Seasons change, tan lines fade
But some memories never go away
But we got close, close as it gets
That’s a brush with love I’ll never forget
So close, but still so far
That summer’s still got a hold of my heart
It was worth it
It was perfect
Near miss, by an inch
Almost
I guess that’s just how it goes
Girl we got close
