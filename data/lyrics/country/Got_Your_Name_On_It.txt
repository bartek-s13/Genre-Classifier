There's a spot in my driveway
Where you can park your car
I know a place off the highway
Where there's a sky full of stars, it ain't far
Got a bottle of red wine
Just waiting for the right night
The right girl, the right time
Sounds good, don't it?

Well, it's got your name on it
If you want it
Every day I got left
Every dollar in my pocket
That shotgun side of my F-150
Girl, you know
I want you in it
Every minute
Got a front porch seat for you girl, if you can swing it
My start, my end, my heart, my hand
You could have it right now if you want it
It's got your name on it

Got a little space on the right side
Of this king size bed (King size bed)
And there's three little words I ain't ever said yet (Ever said yet)
I'd spell it out in a tattoo
On my arm just for you
Right there in plain view
So the whole world knows it
(Knows it, knows it)

'Cause it's got your name on it
If you want it
Every day I got left
Every dollar in my pocket
That shotgun side of my F15-0
Girl, you know
I want you in it
Every minute
Got a front porch seat for you girl, if you can swing it
My start, my end, my heart, my hand
You could have it right now if you want it
It's got your name on it
It's got your name on it

My sun up, sun down
My forever, my right now
If you like how that sounds
You might as well own it
(Own it, own it)

'Cause it's got your name on it
If you want it
Every day I got left
Every dollar in my pocket
That shotgun side of my F15-0
Girl, you know
I want you in it
Every minute
Got a front porch seat for you girl, if you can swing it
My start, my end, my heart, my hand
You could have it right now if you want it
It's got your name on it
It's got your name on it

It's got your name on it
It's got your name on it
It's got your name on it
