Drinkin' and Drivin'
Five Dollars worth of Regular, Three Dollars worth of wine
Just hand me a road map, show me the state line
I got the blues on my bumper, Lord, I gotta leave 'em behind
Yeah, I'm gonna drink and drive that woman right off of my mind
She bought a ticket for Texas, left me late last night
I got a ticket this morning for a D.U.I
10-4 Ten Dollars is my very last dime
I'm gonna take it and drink and drive that woman right off of my mind
Breaker, Breaker, this is Heartache, now hear me loud and clear
I got a memory on my tailgate, Hey-hey, and old smokey's on my rear
I'm gonna chase my headlights till I can drink me blind
I'm gonna be drinkin' and drivin' that woman right off of my mind

She took my Grandma's picture and everything I had
I'm half tanked on misery, I've never felt so bad
My walls are filled with nothin' I can't face 'em tonight
So I'm-a gonna keep drinkin' and drivin' that woman right off of my mind
Breaker, Breaker, this is Heartache, now hear me loud and clear
I got a memory on my tailgate, Lord, and old smokey's on my rear
I'm gonna chase my headlights till I can drink me blind
I'm gonna be drinkin' and drivin' that woman right off of my mind
