They've been up on stage and they've been front row
They've been the life of the party, sometimes they didn't even go
Them and my jeans and a cut off shirt
Spend a lot of time doin' hard work in the red dirt
Yeah, I've been through it all

With these scuffed up, dark brown
Broke in, worn out, made out of leather
Been around forever
Steel toes are all I've ever known
Done a lot of right, done a little wrong
But the one thing you won't see my boots do
Is step on the red, white, and blue

Laced up and camo, overseas protectin'
So I guess I'll never know why people disrespect it
That flag's for the land of the free
And it's more than stars and stripes to me
And that's, that's why you'll never see, no
Never see

These scuffed up, dark brown
Broke in, worn out, made out of leather
Been around forever
Steel toes are all I've ever known
Done a lot of right, done a little wrong
But the one thing you won't see my boots do
Is step on the red, white, and blue
I believe everybody needs their freedom of speech
But the second I see someone steppin' on the flag
That ass is gonna meet

These scuffed up, dark brown
Broke in, worn out, made out of leather
Been around forever
Steel toes are all I've ever known
Done a lot of right, done a little wrong
These scuffed up, dark brown
Broke in, worn out, made out of leather
Been around forever
Steel toes are all I've ever known
Done a lot of right, done a little wrong
But the one thing you won't see my boots do
I said the one thing you won't see my boots do
Is step on the red, white, and blue
Don't mess with the red, white, and blue
