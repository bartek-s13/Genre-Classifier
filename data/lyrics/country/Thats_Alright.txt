You might live downtown in a big high-rise (that’s alright)
You might live in a double wide (that’s alright)
Take a deep breath and thank the lord
Check your troubles at the door
We all know what we’re here for
That’s alright
Turn right on the red at the four way stop
Ain’t no street lights on this blacktop
There’s a farm gate cross the gravel road
A no trespass sign with bullet holes
Come on in make yourself at home
That’s alright
It’s gonna be good, it’s gonna be great
It might get loud and it might go late
There’s a pretty good chance it’ll last all night
But that’s ok that’s alright
Broke your glass on the kitchen floor (that’s alright)
Get a plastic cup, pour you some more (that’s alright)
Well it’s summer time and it’s just hot
We gotta cool little swimming spot
Tiki torches out on the dock
And that’s alright
It’s gonna be good, it’s gonna be great
It might get loud and it might go late
There’s a pretty good chance it’ll last all night
But that’s ok that’s alright
There ain’t a whole lotta rules ‘round her
If the beer runs out have no fear
We’ll just call ol’ uncle Jack
He’ll bring something in a paper sack
Speakers in the truck ‘bout to blow
Got it cranked up to ten point o
Chicken in the bread pan pickin’ out dough
Granny does your dog bite no child no
It’s gonna be good, it’s gonna be great
It might get loud and it might go late
There’s a pretty good chance it’ll last all night
But that’s ok that’s alright
Yeah you might live in a big high-rise (that’s alright)
You might live in a double wide (that’s alright)
We hang out down a gravel road (that’s alright)
No trespass sign with bullet holes (that’s alright)
