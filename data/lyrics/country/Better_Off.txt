Look at you out with all your friends
Look at us cutting up again
Laughing bout, remember when
Could have been back thought when we were in love
But I ain't chosen you, ain’t  mine no more
What we had finally ran its course
What it got  me goodbye for
And I believe that door looks pretty good shut
Yeah, girl you know what

We're Better off, without the strings
No tangle up, fighting, no silly things
Everything is easier now, about it baby
And it cool hanging out with me, driving each other crazy
We're better off,  than we’d ever been
Yeah the glass slipper never really fit you then
Don't know why we play pretend
But we play pretend for too damn long
Yeah we are better off, than we’re on

Easy come baby easy go, that was us
Next thing you know
You got dresses in my closet
I got T-shirts in your dresser
It all ended up in boxes and now for it to burry


Off again
I don't want to play that game
Making room at this table for more than just friends
Don’t be ashame
Don't you think
We're better off,  than we’d ever been
Yeah  the Glasslipper never really fit you then
Don't know why we play pretend
But we play pretend for too damn long
Yeah we are better off
Better off,  better off
Than we’re on
Yeah we’re  better off, than we’re on
