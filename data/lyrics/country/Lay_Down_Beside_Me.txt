John:
I've spent my life
Lookin for you
Findin' my way
Wasn't easy to do
But I knew there was you
All the while
And it's been worth
Every mile
So lay down beside me
Love me and hide me
And kiss all the hurtin'
Of this world away
Hold me so close
That I feel your heart beat
And don't ever wander away
Alison:
Mornings and evenings
All were the same
There was no music
Til I heard your name
I knew when I saw you smile
And now I can rest for a while
Both:
So lay down beside me
Love me and hide me
Kiss all the hurtin'
Of this world away
Hold me so close
That I feel your heart beat
And don't ever wander away
And hold me so close
That I feel your heart beat
And don't ever wander away
*Alison hums
John:
Love me and hide me
*Both hum
John:
'Til I feel your heart beat
*both hum
