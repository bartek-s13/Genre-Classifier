I walked into work
And I told
That today I'm leaving and I ain't coming back
'Cause it's worth more than diamonds and it's worth more than pearls
If I can have all the time in the world
Just to be with you

I walked four miles in the pouring rain
And I stood in line catch a south bound train
When I reached the counter and I tried to pay
You know I came up short so I'm still looking for a way
Just to be with you, just to be with you, just to be with you
What I wouldn't do just to be with you

I was walking by brand new dealer lots
So I hopped in a car and I wired it hot
Now I'm running 90 and if I get caught guess
I'll tell the judge that I did it all just to be with you
Just to be with you, just to be with you
What I wouldn't do just to be with you
Just to be with you, just to be with you
What I wouldn't do just to be with you
