I’ve never been a “Cool Hand Luke”
The quarterback of the winning team
Or the guy with the right kinda punch-lines
Everybody wants to be
I never was that lucky ol cuss with a straight flush in his hand
Oh, but with you, I am
I ain’t no Patrick Swayze, my old boots never danced on air
Never walked with a swag looking sharp as a tack
Lit up like Time Square
Who’s that guy with a big old smile as wide as the Rio Grande
Oh, with you I am
Strong as an oak, soft like leather
High as a pine and light as a feather
The same ol boy but a whole lot better
Whenever you’re holding my hand
I use to poke fun at them punch drunk lovers
I never thought I’d be that man
Oh but with you I am, Oh baby with you I am
I’ve always been a “do it my way” drifter
Another highway, another town
Never thought about bout that little white house
With a porch all the way around
Yeah I never saw me on a swing talking sweet talking dreams but I’ll be damned
With you I am
Strong as an oak, soft like leather
High as a pine and light as a feather
The same ol boy but a whole lot better
Whenever you’re holding my hand
I use to poke fun at them punch drunk lovers
I never thought I’d be that man
Oh baby with you, I am
Oh baby with you, I am
