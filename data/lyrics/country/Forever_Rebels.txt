How dare you step out of the lights
How dare you step out of the box
Don't go pushin' your luck
Just be happy with what you've got
But we don't buy that
No we don't buy that
'Cause we're the dreamers
We're the believers
Yeah we're the straight up ain't no backin' down
Shake it off this town
Against the wind
And out of fringe
And we ain't never gonna settle
Forever rebels
Ain't never gonna settle
Forever rebels
Been known to smash a few walls
Been known to break a few rules
Yeah we'll throw you a curve
Kick up the dirt when we have to
No we can't help that
Ain't sorry 'bout that
'Cause we're the dreamers
We're the believers
Yeah we're the straight up ain't no backin' down
Shake it off this town
Against the wind
And out of fringe
And we ain't never gonna settle
Forever rebels
Ain't never gonna settle
Forever rebels
Hey lookin' up at them stars
We ain't afraid to get that high
My little crazy trying on wings
'Till you figure out how to fly
Who cares what everybody else says
Can't find heaven unless you're hell bent
What you want and you got it, go get it, tonight
'Cause we're the dreamers
We're the believers
Yeah we're the straight up ain't no backin' down
Shake it off this town
Against the wind
And out of fringe
And we ain't never gonna settle
Forever rebels
Ain't never gonna settle
Forever rebels
Ain't never gonna settle
Forever rebels
Yeah, forever rebels
Oh, forever rebels
