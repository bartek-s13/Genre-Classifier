On Franklin and 4th in an ice cold sweat
Throwing rocks at the Starbucks where she and I met
I got drunk on the past every day, every night
'Til you sobered me up, got her off my mind

Used to walk those streets like the walking dead
It's like somebody sent you so you could come and save me

Your kiss is making me feel again
Those lips are stronger than medicine
Falling, I'm all in
You brought me back to life
More alive than I've ever been
I don't wanna be six feet under her
I wanna be right under you
And your lips on my lips, yeah
Kickstart my heart like adrenaline
Baby, like adrenaline

Like that forgot-about-Chevy running on fumes
I was caught in the mud, now I'm caught up on you
I get drunk off of you every day, every night
And you run through my veins, got my blood pressure high
Baby I could get used to this
Yeah I could get used to

Your kiss is making me feel again
Those lips are stronger than medicine
Falling, I'm all in
You brought me back to life
More alive than I've ever been
I don't wanna be six feet under her
I wanna be right under you
And your lips on my lips, yeah
Kickstart my heart like adrenaline
Ooh yeah baby, like adrenaline

Dazed and confused is how I used to be
It's like somebody sent you so you could come and save me
That kiss is making me feel again
Those lips are something like medicine
I'm falling, I'm all in
Girl I'm back from the dead and I'm better than I've ever been

Your kiss is making me feel again
Those lips are stronger than medicine
Falling, I'm all in
You brought me back to life
More alive than I've ever been
I don't wanna be six feet under her
I wanna be right under you
And your lips on my lips, yeah
Kickstart my heart like adrenaline
Mmm yeah baby, like adrenaline
