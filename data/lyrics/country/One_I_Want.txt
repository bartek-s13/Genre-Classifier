When I say I want you, girl I mean it
When I say I love you, you're gonna feel it
Each and everyday I go out of my way, above and beyond
Just so you don't have to wonder
You're the one I want

Gonna write you love songs, to show my feelings
I could tell you, but I'd rather sing it
Throw your name in the chorus of a love song story so catchy
Make everybody wanna sing along
Just so you don't have to wonder
You're the one I want

Don't have all the answers, when I take the floor
When it comes to uncertainty, I've never been more sure
Darling when it comes to you, I've never had a doubt
You're the face of the woman in my dreams
I've been dreaming about

Gonna take you dancing, when we get home
You'll cry because you're happy and that your love has grown
And I'll kiss you on the forehead, and say baby what's wrong?
You'll say nothing
I just love you cause you never made me wonder
You're the one I want
