I used to get there early when I was a boy
I'd straighten the pews on a hardwood floor
Daddy shook every hand as they gathered in
We were prayer warriors in a world of sin
We'd sing there ain't no grave going to hold me down
And Sister started clappin', then somebody'd shout
The spirit would rise and fill the House
As the walls came tumblin' down
Oh the walls came tumblin' down

Oh the devil took a beatin' at Wednesday night prayer meetin'
We heard hell fire preachin'
At Wednesday night prayer meetin'
Amazin' Grace fell like a flood
And we all got washed in the Blood
That's the way it was
At Wednesday night prayer meetin'


Now I walk through the valley all by myself
There's a road to the right and a road to the left
The shadows have fallen and I'm all alone
But there's still a light shinin' that leads me home
I see the candles in the windows of
That little church that I love
I still hear 'em singin' on a Wednesday night
"I'll meet you on the other side
Oh I'll meet you on the other side"
Oh the devil took a beatin' at Wednesday night prayer meetin'
We heard hell fire preachin'
At Wednesday night prayer meetin'
Amazin' Grace fell like a flood
And we all got washed in the Blood
Yeah, that's the way it was
At Wednesday night prayer meetin'

Yeah that's the way it was
At Wednesday night prayer meetin'
