You might think 'cause I was raised in the hollar where the roads ain't got no names
That I'm just a good ol' Kentucky boy chasin' down a few minutes of fame
But it's clear as white whiskey, they don't get me
Those suites just wanna portray
A dumb hillbilly, naw not really
I got somethin' to say

Who I am ain't hard to see
It's a cross on my neck, blood, tears, and sweat
That keeps me on my feet
I've gone with the devil, he couldn't break this man
If there's a doubt in your mind it's time you know who I am
Yeah, who I am

There ain't enough money to buy my soul
Even a fool would think that's gold
Burn that deal, got back control
Easy come, easy go
I earned my keep where nothin' was handed
Live my life by the ten commandments
Makin' my own, but some can't stand it
Don't hold me down, no

Who I am ain't hard to see
It's a cross on my neck, blood, tears, and sweat
That keeps me on my feet
I've gone with the devil, he couldn't break this man
If there's a doubt in your mind it's time you know who I am
Yeah, who I am
Who I am ain't hard to see
It's a cross on my neck, blood, tears, and sweat
That keeps me on my feet
I've gone with the devil, he couldn't break this man
If there's a doubt in your mind it's time you know who I am
Yeah, who I am
If there's a doubt in your mind it's time you know who I am
Yeah, who I am
Who I am, who I am, who I am

That's who I am
