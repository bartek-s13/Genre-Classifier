Right there babe, hold the chat
Let me grab your face in this app
If it ain't new, it ain't cool
Look at that face, it's so finetuned
Remember back when we were young
Everything was simple and games were fun
Everybody got a life of Riley
No matter what, we always smile

I need it, and SOS I'm calling
From my iOS
One touch of my touchscreen
One click and everybody else sees
That picture, when we're looking so hot
Got my Aviators on so they don't think I'm not
Put a filter on for my guy
'Cause you know it looks better in Lowfi
Everybody gone crazy
We're all just social babies

Oh, oh, oh
Ah, ah
Oh, oh, oh
Ah, ah
Come on babe I really can't take it
Virtual life is so overrated
Look up from that goddamn phone
'Cause I can't talk to your head no more
Didn't use to be this way
What even matters from yesterday?
Battery gone, now fit me in
Can we just walk and not check-in?

I need it, and SOS I'm calling
From my iOS
One touch of my touchscreen
One click and everybody else sees
That picture, when we're looking so hot
Got my Aviators on so they don't think I'm not
Put a filter on for my guy
'Cause you know it looks better in Lowfi
Everybody gone crazy
We're all just social babies

Oh, oh, oh
Ah, ah
Oh, oh, oh
Ah, ah
Let the world wait, and just be
Wanna look at anything on that little screen
Let's press pause and and stay in
You're not the only one I'm craving

I need it, and SOS I'm calling
From my iOS
One touch of my touchscreen
One click and everybody else sees
That picture, when we're looking so hot
Got my Aviators on so they don't think I'm not
Put a filter on for my guy
'Cause you know it looks better in Lowfi
Everybody gone crazy
We're all just social babies

Oh, oh, oh
Ah, ah
Oh, oh, oh
Ah, ah
Oh, oh, oh (Oh, yeah)
Ah, ah
Oh, oh, oh (Oh, yeah)
