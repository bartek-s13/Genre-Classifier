One of us still has our picture taped up on the dash
One of us took that one from Mexico, threw it in the trash
One of us don't even notice when the radio plays that song
One of us breaks down and has to pull over whenever it comes on
Nah there ain't no in between, when it comes to her and me

One of us moved on, one of us got stuck
One of us is drinkin' just for fun, one of us drinkin' to get drunk
One of us sleeps good, and one of us hates to face the night
Just depends if you're talkin' about her world or mine

There's a number on a phone that one of us erased
There's a "late-night can we try again?" call one of us wants to make
'Cause one of us can't even think about bein' in another's arms
And there's a car in the drive that stayed all night, where one of us used to park

One of us moved on, one of us got stuck
One of us is drinkin' just for fun, one of us drinkin' to get drunk
One of us sleeps good, and one of us hates to face the night
Just depends if you're talkin' about her world or mine

For a while we had forever in our hands
That's why one of us can't understand

How one of us moved on, one of us got stuck
One of us is drinkin' just for fun, one of us drinkin' to get drunk
One of us sleeps good, one of us hates to face the night
Just depends if you're talkin' about her world or mine

Yeah that's the difference between her world or mine
