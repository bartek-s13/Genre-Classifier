If you find a girl, hands up, hangin' halfway out on a highway
If you find  a girl who likes whiskey mixed in her hangover coffee
Find a girl that scares you half to death
You'd kill to be the train she wrecks
Don't tell her I never met someone like you
Then try and turn her into every girl you ever knew

If you're gonna love her, if you're gonna love her
If you're gonna love, leave her leave her wild
If you're gonna make her, if you're gonna make her
Make her smile, smile
If you're gonna let her, if you're gonna let her
Let her dance, let her sing, let her be what ever she wants to be
Leave her wild

Don't tame her, try to chain her
The second you do you'll break her
Don't dull that shine that caught your eye
'Cause you're afraid somebody will take her
She ain't a dial you just turn on and off
She ain't found, but she ain't all that lost

If you're gonna love her, if you're gonna love her
If you're gonna love, leave her leave her wild
If you're gonna make her, if you're gonna make her
Make her smile, smile
If you're gonna let her, if you're gonna let her
Let her dance, let her sing, let her be what ever she wants to be
Leave her wild
Oh, leave her wild, yeah
Leave her wild, leave he wild
Leave her wild
If you're gonna kiss her, if you're gonna kiss her
Kiss her slow
If you wanna change her, if you wanna change her
Let her go
If you're gonna let her, if you're gonna let her
Let her dance, let her sing, let her be what ever she wants to be

If you're gonna love her, if you're gonna love her
If you're gonna love, leave her leave her wild
If you're gonna make her, if you're gonna make her
Make her smile, smile
If you're gonna let her, if you're gonna let her
Let her dance, let her sing, let her be what ever she wants to be
Leave her wild
Leave her wild, wild
Yeah, leave her wild, leave her wild
Let her dance, let her sing, let her be what ever she wants to be
If you're gonna love her, if you're gonna love her
Leave her wild
Leave her wild
