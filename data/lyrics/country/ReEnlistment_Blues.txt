My hitch was up Monday
Not a dog soljer nor more
Soljer no more
They give me all that money
So much my pockets is sore
Pockets is sore
More dough than I can use
Re-Enlistment Blues
Oh
Them blues
Took my gelt to town Tuesday
Found me a big double bed
Big double bed
I'll find a job tomorrow
Tonight I'll maybe be dead
Maybe be dead
Ain't no time to lose
Re-Enlistment Blues
Oh
Them blues
Hit the bars Wednesday
Friends put me up on a throne
(way) up on a throne
Found a Chinese baby
She wouldn't leave me alone
Leave me alone
Did I give her a bruise
Re-Enlistment Blues
Oh
Them blues
I woke up on Thursday
The walls was movin'
I swear
Movin' I swear
I reach'd down in my trousers
AII my pockets was bare
Nothin' was there
I'll really blew my fuse
Re-Enlistment Blues
Oh
Them blues
Hit the bar again Friday
Ask'd for a free glass of beer
Free glass of beer
Bar man he don't know me
He just say no credit here
No credit here
What I done then ain't news
Re-Enlistment Blues
Oh
Them blues
