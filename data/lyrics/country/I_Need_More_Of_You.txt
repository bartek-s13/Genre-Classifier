Hearts, burning like they were on fire
Flames, changin' our love to desire
Say, my heart is screamin' to say
Girl, we got to go all the way

I need more of you, changin' my rain into sun
More of you, puttin' my blues on the run
I need more of you, darling I need more of you
More, anything less wouldn't do

We, ain't we together too long
Strange, how did our love get so strong
There's, nothing to keep us apart
We, got to catch up our hearts

I need more of you, changin' my rain into sun
More of you, puttin' my blues on the run
I need more of you, darling I need more of you
More, anything less wouldn't do


I need more of you, changin' my rain into sun
More of you, puttin' my blues on the run
I need more of you, darling I need more of you
More, anything less wouldn't do
