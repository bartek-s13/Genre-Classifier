Thought I'd wake up
Somehow that weight would be off my chest
Last night I said what I couldn't say before
I thought we'd break up
And it wouldn't take much for me to move on and
Find someone I'm a whole lot better for
Now I'm starting to think
It ain't that easy

I hated to do what I had to do
Cause I was afraid of hurting you
I thought I was good with goodbye
But my heart's having a hard time (hard time)
Making sense of how I'm doing what's right
Got me so tore up inside
Yeah, I know I made up my mind
But my heart, my heart's having a hard time

It shouldn't be so tough for me
To change my lock screen, but it's sinking in that I don't get to kiss that smile no more
We had a million reasons
Someone had to do the leaving, but how I thought I'd feel ain't how I'm feeling

I hated to do what I had to do
Cause I was afraid of hurting you
I thought I was good with goodbye
But my heart's having a hard time
Making sense of how I'm doing what's right
Got me so tore up inside
Yeah, I know I made up my mind
But my heart, my heart's having a hard time

Now I'm missing you
Now I'm wishing you
And I had worked it out
If it was so wrong
Why am I still loving you now?
