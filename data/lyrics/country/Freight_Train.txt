I'm gonna give em that 2, 4, 4 on the floor, like an outlaws boys on the day
Before. got the pretty girls out there begging for more
Gotta give em all what
They came here for. Doin' my thing singing my song
Right on track I'm chugging
Along. I'm here and gone like yesterday
Rolling like an old freight train

On a wing and a prayer and a glorified greyhound bus
Flying down the road running
9-0 and kicking up dust
Drinkin' truck stop coffee countin' birds on those telephone wires. Burnin' the midnight oil
And the tread off these old goodyear
Tires

I'm gonna give em that 2, 4, 4 on the floor
Like an outlaws boys on the day
Before. got the pretty girls out there begging for more
Gotta give em all what they came here for
Doin' my thing singing my song, right on track I'm chugging
Along. I'm here and gone like yesterday, rolling like an old freight train

And sometimes my mind is a million miles away
I know you're sound asleep at
Home while I'm on this stage. and I'm missing you
Wishing I was kissing you
Everyday. but girl I gotta keep rollin'
Rollin like an old freight train. and its a
Mighty lonesome sound when there's not soul around
To help you ease your pain
But you gotta keep rollin'. Rollin' like an old freight train
I'm gonna give em that
2, 4, 4 on the floor, like an outlaws boys on the day before
Got the pretty
Girls out there begging for more
Gotta give em all what they came here for
Doin' my thing singing my song, right on track I'm chugging along
I'm here and gone like yesterday, rolling like an old freight train
Comin' on down the line
Feel that diesel engine whine, smell the smoke stack
Hear the gears grind full steam ahead halfway out of my mind
I'm too far gone to be turning back
Going clickity clack down the railroad tracks
I'm here and gone like yesterday
Rolling like an old freight train. just like an old freight train
Tell me do you wanna ride this train
