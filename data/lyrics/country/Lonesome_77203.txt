Had our number changed today, although I hated to
But each time the phone would ring
They'ed want to speak to you
And it hurt's to tell them, your not here with me
May be now, oh telephone will let me be
It's not in the book now, so you'd better write it down
Just in case your love for me, should ever come around
You might want to call, and break the news to me
Just call lonesome 7-7203
I keep the telephone be side me all the time
Hoping you might want to call, and say
You've changed your mind
If you do then darling you know, where I'll be
I'm at lonesome 7-7203
Your the only one I'm giving our new number too
So now if the telephone should ring I'll know It's you
If you ever long for love that used to be
Just call lonesome 7-7203
Just call lonesome 7-7203
