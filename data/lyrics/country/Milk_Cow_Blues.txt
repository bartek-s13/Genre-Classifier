Well, I woke up this mornin' looked outdoor
I can tell my milk cow
I can tell by the way she lows
If you see my milk cow, please, drive her on home
'Cause I ain't had no milk and butter
Since my cow's been gone
Well, you gotta treat me right day by day
Get out your little prayer book
Get down upon your knees and pray
'Cause you're gonna to need me
You're gonna need my help someday
Yeah, you're goin' to be sorry you treated me this way
Sail on, sail on, sail on, little girl, sail on
Sail on, sail on, sail on, little girl, sail on
You're gonna keep right on to sailin' till you lose your happy home
Well, good evenin', don't that sun look good goin' down?
Well, good evenin', don't that sun look good goin' down?
Don't that ol' army cot look lonesome when your lover ain't around?
Now, I tried everythin', baby, to get along with you
Now I'm goin' tell you what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna stop my cryin' and leave you alone
And if you don't think I'm leavin', big momma
Just count the days I'm gone 'cause ain't gonna see
Ain't gonna see my sweet face no more
Yeah, you gonna be wonderin', honey
Where in this world I've gone
