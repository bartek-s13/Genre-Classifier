Do you think I'm such a fool
To believe everything
That you say is true
That just goes to show
That you really don't know
While you're out painting the town
Do you think I'm home
Just sitting around
Waiting on you
Now who's really the fool
When I first found out
I hurt all over
I felt so left out
Till I got to know her
So I tried to wait
But she got over
And I became just like her
So don't be surprised to find
(CHORUS)
That the angel in
Your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil
In someone else's arms tonight
Yes, the angel in
Your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil
In someone else's arms tonight
Why'd you slip around secretly
If you were tired of loving me
Why'd you keep holding on
When love was already gone
The times you said
You weren't feeling well
Did you think I couldn't tell
You've been with somebody else
You were only kidding yourself
When I first found out
I hurt all over
I felt so left out
Till I got to know her
So I tried to wait
But she got over
And I became just like her
So don't be surprised to find
(CHORUS)
That the angel in
Your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil
In someone else's arms tonight
Yes, the angel in
Your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil
In someone else's arms tonight
(CHORUS)
That the angel in
Your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil
In someone else's arms tonight
Yes, the angel in
Your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil
In someone else's arms tonight
