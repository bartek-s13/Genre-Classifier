On my way to your house
Sneakers in the snow
I only wanna see her
And my thoughts are so loud
'Cause I just wanna know, are you gonna keep her?

Only call you faded
Sorry, I know you hate it
Probably shouldn't say this
But it hurts to bite my tongue

Does she know that you held me in the dark?
Does she know that I had you from the start?
Does she know that the bruises never change?
My marks are on your heart
I had you from the start
Remember?

Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Does she know?
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Holding water in my hands, but it never lasts
Slipping through my fingers
Think I held on too tight
Cutting off the blood
You don't feel a thing 'til it hurts

Only call you faded
Sorry, I know you hate it, oh
Probably shouldn't say this
But I'm done biting my tongue

Now, does she know that you held me in the dark?
Does she know that I had you from the start?
Does she know that the bruises never change?
My marks are on your heart
I had you from the start
Remember?

Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Does she know?
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Does she know?
Does she know? (Does she know?)
Does she know that you held me in the dark?
Does she know that I had you from the start?
Does she know that the bruises never change?
My marks are on your heart
I had you from the start
