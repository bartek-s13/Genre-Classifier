I got some drinkin' to do
I got some goin' through hell
I got some whiskey to waste, memories to erase
Just me and myself
I got some pictures to burn
Pictures of me and you
I got some fallin' apart in this dark little bar
I've got some drinkin' to do

When I'm sober
Yeah, the nights drag on too long
So I'll keep livin' this lie like a fool
Killin' time while they pour my drinks too strong
Might be reckless
Yeah, I'm guessin'
I'll be hurtin' when I'm through
But I'll be one hangover closer
To over you

I got some lonely to face
I got some sorry to be
I got words that you said in my head
I got friends checking up on me
I might be throwin' 'em back
Like I got somethin' to prove
I got a couple mistakes that I still gotta make
I got some drinkin' to do

When I'm sober
Yeah, the nights drag on too long
So I'll keep livin' this lie like a fool
Killin' time while they pour my drinks too strong
Might be reckless
Yeah, I'm guessin'
I'll be hurtin' when I'm through
But I'll be one hangover closer
To over you
When I'm sober
Yeah, the nights drag on too long
I'll keep livin' this lie like a fool
Killin' time while they pour my drinks too strong
I might be reckless
Yeah, I'm guessin'
I'll be hurtin' when I'm through
But for now
I got some drinkin' to do
