He held her in his arms that first September
And it scared them both to finally go that far
All night long they talked about forever
And they couldn't hide the feelings in their hearts
He said, "I don't wanna spend tonight alone"
But it's late and I really should get home
And she said, "Please, please don't leave me now
Oh, please, please don't leave me now
I don't wanna let you go, I know it's love we've found
Please, please don't leave me now"
The wedding bells still ringing in his memory
A baby cry with her first breath of life
And he stood beside the bed with his new family
And brushed away a pain drop from her eye
She said, "Don't worry hon, I'm just a little weak"
And he said, "Close your eyes and try to get some sleep"
And she said, "Please, please don't leave me now
Oh, please, please don't leave me now
I need a little strength from you, God, you look so proud
Please, please don't leave me now"
At night she lay burning with a fever
He held her hand, got on his knees and prayed
Then he brought the baby close so she could see her
And he cried out as he felt her slip away
Please, please don't leave me now
Oh, please, please don't leave me now
God, if you've been listening
And you hear these words somehow
Please, please don't leave me now
Oh, please, please don't leave me now
