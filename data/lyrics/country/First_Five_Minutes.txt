I was up on a bar stool
I was peeling a label
I was minding my own
Sitting alone until in walked an angel
You swept in through the front door
Like fresh air for the breathing
Looking hot as July
And your kinda fire was just was the night needed
A hello and I was gone

In the first five minutes your said name
And baby, I could feel the earth shake
Knew from the second I saw your face
I found a piece of heaven and I got lost in it
Lost in the feeling, lost in your eyes
Lost in your arms in the sunrise
Coulda told you I loved you and I woulda meant it
In the first five minutes, yeah
In the first five minutes

And now not a day goes by
I can't get you off my mind
And there's no going back
But girl I knew that
In the first five minutes your said name
And baby, I could feel the earth shake
Knew from the second I saw your face
I found a piece of heaven and I got lost in it
Lost in the feeling, lost in your eyes
Lost in your arms in the sunrise
Coulda told you I loved you and I woulda meant it
In the first five minutes, yeah
In the first five minutes

You were in the right place
On the right night
We found the real thing
In no time

Yeah, in the first five minutes your said name
And baby, I could feel the earth shake
Knew from the second I saw your face
I found a piece of heaven and I got lost in it
Lost in the feeling, lost in your eyes
Lost in your arms in the sunrise
Coulda told you I loved you and I woulda meant it
In the first five minutes, yeah
In the first five minutes
