I was guilty with nothing to say
And they were coming to take me away
When a voice from Heaven was heard that said
"Let him go and take Me instead"
Oh I should have been crucified
And I should have suffered and died
I should have hung on the cross in disgrace
But Jesus, God's Son, took my place
That crowns of thorns, the spear in His side
And the pain, it should have been mine
Those rusty nails were meant for me
Yet Christ took them and let me go free
