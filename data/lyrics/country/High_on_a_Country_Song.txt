I was born in blue jeans with a guitar in my hands
When I turned eighteen, I traded in my truck for a van
Just me and the boys chasing highway signs
Leaving the only life we'd ever known behind
Selling everything we owned just to be in a band

It's all about the big lights shining bright
Whiskey got you feeling right
Kickdrum like a shotgun rippin' through the night
Raising hell and Dixie cups all night long
It's all about the sweat-soaked t-shirts
Partying until it hurts
Leaning on the backbeat, screaming every single word
Nothing like getting high on a country song

I bought a George Jones ticket
The last time he rolled through town
And it's a damn good thing 'cause he never rolled back around
That White Lightning had us all feeling fine
And we were all tore up on yesterday's wine
Sipping on Tennessee Whiskey and getting down

It's all about the big lights shining bright
Whiskey got you feeling right
Kickdrum like a shotgun rippin' through the night
Raising hell and Dixie cups all night long
It's all about the sweat-soaked t-shirts
Partying until it hurts
Leaning on the backbeat, screaming every single word
Nothing like getting high on a country song
Oh get 'em started son

It's the big lights shining bright
Whiskey got you feeling right
Kickdrum like a shotgun rippin' through the night
Raising hell and Dixie cups all night long
It's all about the sweat-soaked t-shirts
Partying until it hurts
Leaning on the backbeat, screaming every single word
Nothing like getting high on a country song
Oh there's nothing like getting high on a country song
On a country song
