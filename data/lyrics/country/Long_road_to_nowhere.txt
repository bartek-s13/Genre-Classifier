When I'm down on my luck
And drowning in my head
There's nothing I can do
Another lonely ghost town
Another empty bed
I was a fool for losing you
It's a long road to nowhere
Where a million miles ago
I reach for you
It's a long road to nowhere
Where a million miles ago
I reach for you
I reach for you
For your love
There's no one that knows me better than you
For your love
I've been broken down
Scattered around and I pick up the pieces
And find my way back too
The road it moves in circles
The road it moves in songs
The saddest one's for you
And I know that I've been blind girl
I know that I was wrong
Stubborn through and through
It's a long road to nowhere
Where a million miles ago
I reach for you
I reach for your love
There's no one that knows me better than you
It's a long road to nowhere
Where a million miles ago
I reach for you
I reach for you
