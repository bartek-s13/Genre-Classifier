I got me a room
In a cheap hotel
My head was a spinnin'
And I didn't feel well
I laid right down
And tried to go to sleep
A band kept a playin'
In a joint underneath
I picked up my pillow
And I covered up my head
But the band kept a playin'
And a shakin' my bed
Honky tonk all night long
Honky tonk, same old song
Honky tonk, my money's all gone
Honky tonk, she done me wrong
I turned and I tossed
And I couldn't go to sleep
'Cause the band kept a playin'
With a honky tonk beat
Well, I'm so blue
My baby's gone
She took all my money
And left me all alone
I'm tryin' to forget her
But I don't know what to do
The honky tonk song
Keeps a leakin' through
I picked up my pillow
And I covered up my head
But the band keeps a playin'
And a shakin' my bed
Honky tonk all night long
Honky tonk, same old song
Honky tonk, my money's all gone
Honky tonk, she done me wrong
I turned and I tossed
And I couldn't go to sleep
'Cause the band keeps a playin'
With a honky tonk beat
