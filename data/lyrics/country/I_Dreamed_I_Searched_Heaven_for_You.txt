I dreamed I had gone to that city
That city where never comes night
And I thought of right angels in glory
I thought of their mansions of light
I gazed for long long years of rapture
On the face of my saviour so true
And I sang with the servants in holy
Then I dreamed I searched heaven for you
I dreamed I searched heaven for you
Searched vainly true heaven for you
Oh won't you prepare to meet me up there
That's we should search heaven for you
I looked on both sides of the river
That flows through the city of God
I searched through bright mansions celestial
And streets of gold pavement thy trod
The faces of saints by the millions
I scanned in my yearning to see
That face I had cherished so fondly
The face that had grown dear to me
I dreamed I searched heaven for you...
