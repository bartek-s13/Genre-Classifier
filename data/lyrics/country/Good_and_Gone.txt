Watchin' that ice sink
In my glass, girl, and I think
It's too bad that it's Friday night
Just somewhere else with someone else
I'm by myself
Still got your old clothes hiding under my bed
Next to your headphones, you said that you'd come and get it
You know I miss seeing you 'round
But I hope you don't show up right now

'Cause I'm gone
Sittin' and sippin' somethin' a little too strong
Taking a shot for everything that went wrong
And that's a lot, it's killing me
Killing me that you've gone
Got you another man, it happened so fast
Two years, it took you two weeks to bounce back
It's kind of sad, you're getting good at moving on
I'm just getting good and gone (Yeah)

This whiskey burn
It kinda tastes like a lesson learned
I swear the more I drink, the less it hurts
Oh no, I'm not sayin' I'm good

I'm just good and gone
Sittin' and sippin' somethin' a little too strong
Taking a shot for everything that went wrong
And that's a lot, it's killing me
Killing me that you've gone
Got you another man, it happened so fast
Two years, it took you two weeks to bounce back
It's kind of sad, you're getting good at moving on
I'm just getting good and gone, oh

Getting good and gone
It hurts how you ain't comin' back
But baby, right now, it ain't all that bad, oh

I'm just good and gone
Sittin' and sippin' somethin' a little too strong
Taking a shot for everything that went wrong
And that's a lot, it's killing me
Killing me that you've gone
Got you another man, it happened so fast
Two years, it took you two weeks to bounce back
It's kind of sad, you're getting good at moving on
I'm just getting good and, getting good and gone

Getting good at moving on
You're getting good at moving on
I'm just getting good and gone
Oh, yeah (It's kinda sad)
You're getting good at moving on
I'm just getting good and gone
