If I had it my way
This would be the first time that I made love
And I would be the first girl that your hands touched
We've both done our share of living
Taking chances we've been given
I've never been too big on looking back
I don't care if I'm your first love
But I'd love to be your last
If I could do it over
I'd have waited for this moment
So I could give my heart to you unbroken
But if our mistakes brought us together
Does it really matter whether
We were saints or sinners in the past?
I don't care if I'm your first love
But I'd love to be your last
All I know is what I see when I look at you
And all I see is what I'm feeling down inside
And all I'm feeling is the feeling that I finally got it right
When I wake up tomorrow
I'm going to wrap my arms around you
Thank my lucky stars I found you
'Cause I know your heart has so much more than
Anyone has touched before and
Nothing matters more to me than that
I don't care if I'm your first love
But I'd love to be your last
I don't care if I'm your first love
But I'd love to be your last
