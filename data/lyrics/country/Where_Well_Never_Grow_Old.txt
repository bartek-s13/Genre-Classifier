I have heard of a land
On the faraway strand
This a beautiful home of the soul
Built by Jesus on high
There we never shall die
This the land where we'll never grow old
Never grow old, never grow old
In the land where we'll never grow old
Never grow old, never grow old
In the land where we'll never grow old
--- Instrumental ---
When our work here is done
And the life's crown is won
And our troubles and trials are o'er
All our sorrow will end
And our voices will blend
With the loved ones who've gone on before
Never grow old, never grow old
In the land where we'll never grow old
Never grow old, never grow old
In the land where we'll never grow old...
