Does he take your hand?
Does he make you laugh?
Tell me girl, is it a temporary thing?
Does he play with your hair?
Wrap you up in his arms?
Kiss your lips and watch you fall asleep?

You ain't gotta say it
But I know that you miss me 'cause

My phone still rings with your name on it
You got a picture with him wearing the shirt that I bought you
You know he'll never do it like I do
That's why you send me a text after two in the morning
Everybody knows that he's holding you tonight
But you hold me in the back of your mind

Did you make a mistake, your little heartbreak?
What if I said I miss you too?
We can get it together girl, tell him it's over
I'm over missing you
I ain't gotta say it
We both know the truth 'cause

My phone still rings with your name on it
You got a picture with him wearing the shirt that I bought you
You know he'll never do it like I do
That's why you send me a text after two in the morning
Everybody knows that he's holding you tonight
But you hold me in the back of your mind

He might be the safe kind
But girl he ain't the right guy

My phone still rings with your name on it
You got a picture with him wearing the shirt that I bought you
You know he'll never do it like I do
That's why you send me a text after two in the morning
Everybody knows that he's holding you tonight
But you hold me in the back of your mind

My phone still rings with your name on it
You got a picture with him wearing the shirt that I bought you, girl
Sending me a text at two in the morning, oh
Everybody knows that he's holding you tonight
But you hold me in the back of your mind
