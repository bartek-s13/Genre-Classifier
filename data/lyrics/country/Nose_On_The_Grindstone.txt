Daddy worked like a mule minin' Pike County coal
'Til he fucked up his back, couldn't work anymore
He said, "One of these days you'll get out of these hills
"Keep your nose on the grindstone and out of the pills"

"See, the ways of this world will just bring you to tears
"Keep the Lord in your heart and you'll have nothin' to fear
"Live the best that you can and don't lie and don't steal
"Keep your nose on the grindstone and out of the pills"

Daddy I've been tryin', I just can't catch a break
There's too much in this world I can't seem to shake
But I remember your words, Lord, they bring me the chills
"Keep your nose on the grindstone and out of the pills"

"Keep in mind that a man's just as good as his word
"It takes twice as long to build bridges you've burnt
"And there's hurt you can cause time alone cannot heal
"Keep your nose on the grindstone and out of the pills"

Well daddy I've been tryin', I just can't catch a break
There's too much in this world I can't seem to shake
But I remember your words, Lord, they bring me to chills
"Keep your nose on the grindstone and out of the pills"
"Keep your nose on the grindstone"
