Hey honey you got it going on
Your body's banging yeah you're bad to the bone
And FYI your T &amp; A are what i'm all about
Your love makes my sticker peck out
Your love makes my sticker peck out
There's a hot hot fire burning way down south
And darlin' you're the only one that can put it out
Your love makes my sticker peck out
Your love makes my sticker peck out
Oh damn, there went all the room
There ain't a square inch lift in my fruit of the looms
Better give me some play before I freak on out
Your love makes my sticker peck out
Your love makes my sticker peck out
There's a hot hot fire burning way down south
And darlin', you're the only one that can put it out
Your love makes my sticker peck out
Your love makes my sticker peck out
(Guitar)
Your love makes my sticker peck out
There's a hot hot fire burning way down south
And darlin' you're the only one that can put it out
Your love makes my sticker peck out
Your love makes my sticker peck out
There ain't no blood left in my brain cause it all went down to my ding-a-ling
I really need to re-adjust cause my god dang zippers 'bout to bust
Your love makes my sticker peck out
There's a hot hot fire burning way down south
And darlin' you're the only one that can put it out
Your love makes my sticker peck out
Your love makes my sticker peck out
Well, your love makes my sticker peck out
