You can't lie to yourself
Sittin' in a quiet room
Not long before the walls
Start whispering back to you
They saw everything and tell the truth
In picture frames
You gave me every second chance
I didn't realize
There would come a last one
Right before your goodbye
And I understood just in time
To be too late and

Baby, I know how hard you tried
But I couldn't see it at the time
And I hate myself tonight
For what I put you through
I deserve every tear I cry
For hurtin' you
The truth is
I woulda left me too

I'm not fool enough to think
You'd ever take me back
Oh, it's much, much, much
Too late for that
And I hope next time love treats you
The way I wish I did, 'cause

Baby, I know how hard you tried
But I couldn't see it at the time
And I hate myself tonight
For what I put you through
I deserve every tear I cry
For hurtin' you
The truth is
I woulda left me too
I woulda left me too

Right now my sorry might not
Mean a thing to you
I just needed you to know
I'm done blaming you

I know, I know how hard you tried
But I couldn't see it at the time
And I hate myself tonight
For what I put you through
I deserve every tear I cry
For hurtin' you
I woulda left me too
I'm done blaming you
I woulda left me too
