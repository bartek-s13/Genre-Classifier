Answering machine says you'll be late again
Third time this week
And I know what you're doing
To tell the truth, it's a relief

Cause that means she and I
Will have a little extra time
And we won't be in such a hurry
But baby, if we break each other's rules
And play each other fools, is it still cheating?

Is it still cheating if both of us are lying?
It's getting hard to tell cause I'm guilty as hell
But baby, so are you
And we're still married
Does that word hold any meaning?
If you're lying next to him
And she's lying next to me
Is it still cheating?

When I pick up the phone
And no one says hello, I know it's him
It's getting to the point where
It don't hardly even change the mood I'm in
With every single promise broke
Deep inside I know I should be dying
Or at least crying
Oh, but if I don't love you
And you don't love me too, is it still cheating?

Is it still cheating if both of us are lying?
It's getting hard to tell cause I'm guilty as hell
But baby, so are you
And we're still married
Does that word hold any meaning?
If you're lying next to him
And she's lying next to me
Is it still cheating?

If you're lying next to him
And she's lying next to me
Is it still cheating?
