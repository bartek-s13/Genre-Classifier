It's that home town feeling
Back tires screaming
Riding those streets that you've always known
(verse 1)
It's the smile from you're Mama when you cross that front porch
Kiss from a girl you thought you'd never get
It's the bright from a town that made a stand up tall
Who wouldn't ever want to feel like that
(chorus)
It's that home town feeling
Back tires screaming
Riding those streets that you've always known
Friday night women where you've been at?
Radio's playing you're brand new song
Ooooooohoohoooo man it's good to be back
Who wouldn't wanna feel like that
Who wouldn't wanna
Who wouldn't wanna feel like that
(verse 2)
Kids on the bridge we used to doubble dare on
It's a long way to the water and it take's me back
That flying as your falling when you finally jump in
Who wouldn't ever want to feel like that
(chorus)
It's that home town feeling
Back tires screaming
Riding those streets that you've always known
Friday night women where you've been at?
Radio's playing you'r brand new song
Ooooooohoohoooo man it's good to be back
Who wouldn't wanna feel like that
(verse 3)
It's that small town alleluia
It's those back roads running through ya
It's where you come from
(chorus)
It's that home town feeling
Back tires screaming
Riding those streets that you've always known
Friday night women where you've been at?
Radio's playing you'r brand new song
Ooooooohoohoooo man it's good to be back
Who wouldn't wanna feel like
Ooooooohoohoooo man it's good to be back
Who wouldn't wanna feel like that
Who wouldn't wanna
Who wouldn't wanna feel like that
(Who wouldn't wanna feel like that)
Who wouldn't wanna
Who wouldn't wanna feel like that
