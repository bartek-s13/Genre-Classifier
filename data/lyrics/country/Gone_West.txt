Headed out to California
Gone west to see the sun
There's a fortune here if you got time, but I’ve found mine
Buried in the golden hair she spun
Sailin' off to search the islands
Gone west for somethin' new
Found paniolo and wave riders, but chose neither
Picked the sweetest sugar cane they grew

I’ve gone west, rollin' down the highway like a tumbleweed
I've gone west, where the canyons fall into the deep blue sea
Took a left from the hills of Tennessee, yeah
I've gone west to bring the best back with me
I've gone west to bring the best back with me

I chased the light to Amarillo
Where the wild horses run
Caught a painted-angel moonrise, kinda spitfire
Like a bullet from a smokin' gun
Goin' back to mama's homeland
Playin’ in the field of dreams
I was lookin’ where the corn grows and the skies glow
And I found your beauty in between
I've gone west, rollin’ down the highway like a tumbleweed
I've gone west, where the canyons fall into the deep blue sea
Took a left from the hills of Tennessee, yeah
I've gone west to bring the best back with me
I've gone west to bring the best back with me

And I follow the fadin’ light
'Til the stars are my map at night
And if you come to get me and my house is empty
It's safe to guess I've gone west

I've gone west, rollin' down the highway like a tumbleweed
I've gone west, where the canyons fall into the deep blue sea
Took a left from the hills of Tennessee, yeah
I've gone west to bring the best back with me
I've gone west to bring the best back with me
