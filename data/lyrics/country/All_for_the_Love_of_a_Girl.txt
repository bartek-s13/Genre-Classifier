Well, today I'm so weary
Today I'm so blue
Sad and broken hearted
And it's all because of you
Life was so sweet dear
Life was a song
Now you've gone and left me
Oh, where do I belong?
And it's all for the love of a dear little girl
All for the love that sets your heart in a whirl
I'm a man who'd give his life
And the joys of this world
All for the love of a girl
And it's all for the love of a dear little girl
All for the love that sets your heart in a whirl
I'm a man who'd give his life
And the joys of this world
All for the love of a girl
