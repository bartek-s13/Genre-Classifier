I don't hurt anymore all my teardrops are dried
No more walking the floor with that burning inside
Just to think it could be time has opened the door
And at last I am free I don't hurt anymore
No use to deny I wanted to die
The day you said we were through
But now that I find you're out of my mind
I can't believe that it's true
I've forgotten somehow that I cared so before
And it's wonderful now I don't hurt anymore
No use to deny I wanted to die
The day you said we were through
But now that I find you're out of my mind
I can't believe that it's true
I've forgotten somehow that I cared so before
And it's wonderful now I don't hurt anymore
