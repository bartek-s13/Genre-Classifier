I’m sorry music 

50,000 for the time
Ain’t worried bout a dime
Glock by my bed
Talk nasty lose your head
These Arabs want me dead
I sit back and count my bread
I’ll shoot you in the head
You heard what I just said

DJ is playing my shit
And he is bringing it back
I just sipped Henny right now
Told her to bring it right back
Pockets are heavy right now
And I just brought out my racks
And we just came up from court
And I said no facts
I was just playing your shit
We was just skipping through dat
Had to go down on your tape
Brought that shit straight to the trash (garbage)
Feeling like I am the one
Chill with your bitch and the cash
Feeling the sorry to ones
Fill up the gas with no cap
Finish the race
And you was in last
I pull up in ‘raris
I had to go blast
You lookin’ at me
But this ain’t that
I’m sorry to ones
My paperback
50,000 for the time
Ain’t worried bout a dime
Glock by my bed
Talk nasty lose your head
These Arabs want me dead
I sit back and count my bread
I’ll shoot you in the head
You heard what I just said

Spending these racks
Spending these racks at the mall
Make all this money
Make all this guap
You know I’m stacking it y’all
Pull out the range
Pull out the Benz
You know the way that I ball
Got a new bitch
I’m on ya chick
You know she gave me a call
Start up the jet
She gettin’ wet
Cuz of the way that I flex
I’m talkin’ money
They gettin’ mad
Cuz I ball with no stress
Blew up my phone
I ain’t got time
No time to check
Who is your mans
I got a salary all on my neck
