I used to sleep away the mornings
Couldn't wait till the sun went down
The weekend was always calling
I couldn't wait to get my self down town
Mum and dad would try to reach me
I was too busy to take their calls
I'd say "I could talk tomorrow" but I never did and that's nothing new at all
But those days are long gone now
And you wake up a little older, your baby's lying on your shoulder and just like that everything has changed
You can't stop time, days will always roll on by and before you know it you realise that nothing stays the same
If I could tell my younger self I'd say, don't wish it all away
From getting muddy in the backyard, to letting me teach you how to play guitar
I'll be there when your heart breaks, and watch you take a drive in your first car
I often think if you'll be like me, pull out of the gate when you turn eighteen
You probably think its going slowly, but don't move too fast 'cause things will all work out
But I'm  that now
And you wake up a little older, your teenager crying on your shoulder and just like that everything has changed
You can't stop time, days will always roll on by and before you know it you realise that nothing stays the same
If I could tell my younger self I'd say, don't wish it all away
Cause just like that, it's moments you can't get back
So don't wish it all away, yeah
And you wake up a little older, you're hoping that your kids come over and just like that everything has changed
You can't stop time, days will always roll on by and before you know it you realise that nothing stays the same
If I could tell my younger self I'd say, even though life goes so fast, its all okay
But don't wish it all away, all away
Don't wish it all away
