I knew a man, called him Sandy Cane
Few folks even knew his name
But a hero yes was he
He left a boy came back a man
Still many just don't understand
About the reasons we are free
I can't forget the look in his eyes
Or the tears he cried
As he said these words to me

All gave some and some gave all
Some stood through for the red, white, and blue
And some had to fall
And if you ever think of me
Think of all your liberties, and recall
Some gave all

Now Sandy Cane is no longer here
But his words are oh so clear
As they echo throughout our land
For all his friends who gave us all
Who stood the ground and took the fall
To help their fellow man
Love your country live with pride
And don't forget those who died
America, can't you see
All gave some
And some gave all
And some stood through for the red, white, and blue
And some had to fall
And if you ever think of me
Think of all your liberties, and recall
Some gave all

And if you ever think of me
Think of all your liberties, and recall, yes recall
Some gave all
Some gave all
