This is it, we’re going in
Time to show ‘em what we’re made of, made of
Sweating blood, here comes the flood
I’m gone but nothing’s gonna shake us, shake us

Until the end of days, they’ll remember our names

Brace yourself, it all goes down tonight
Time will tell who’s here for the hardest fight
You’re gonna hear the fire in our hearts beating
Because we didn’t get this far to get defeated
We want the world to see, world to see
That we’re coming for the victory, victory
You know I’m making history
History, history, we’re making history

All on the line, we’re gonna strike
Oh yeah, we’ll hit ‘em like lightning, lightning
The thunder roars, here comes the storm
We’ll send them running and hiding, hiding

Until the end of days, they’ll remember our names

Brace yourself, it all goes down tonight
Time will tell who’s here for the hardest fight
You’re gonna hear the fire in our hearts beating
Because we didn’t get this far to get defeated
We want the world to see, world to see
That we’re coming for the victory, victory
You know I’m making history
History, history, you know I’m making history

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh...Yeah
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh.. It’s going down tonight

Brace yourself, it all goes down tonight
Time will tell who’s here for the hardest fight
You’re gonna hear the fire in our hearts beating
'Cause we didn’t get this far to get defeated
We want the world to see, world to see
That we’re coming for the victory, victory
You know I’m making history
History, history, we're making history
History, history, you know I’m making history
