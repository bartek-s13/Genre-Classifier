The bottle's all gone, I'm on the floor. Broken heart, I can't take this no more, no more. Cause she's long gone, ain't comin back. Never thought I'd carry on like that, like that. Steady now ahead in the pouring rain, I'm hollerin, screamin out your name, your name
Oh, there's somethin I gotta do. (x2)
I'm heading out west to Oklahoma, to fade your memory and move it off of you. Cause I gotta leave you, leave it all behind. Baby, it wasn't me that made me crazy. That's what I gotta do
The truth is I'm stronger than that. It's been a few years, but I'm sober now, sober now. I drove out here and never went back. Never thought I'd carry on like that, like that. Standin out here and goin insane, hollerin and screamin out your name, your name
Oh, there's somethin I gotta do. (x2)
I'm leavin this state, Oklahoma, flyin back to Georgia to try and find you. Cause I can't leave it, leave it all behind. Sayin everything but blaming it was you. That's what I'm gonna do
Haulin back across that line, try again one last time, it's clear what I gotta do. And this is choking, case is plain, officially have gone insane. This homeboy's got nothing to lose
I'm leavin this state, Oklahoma, flyin back to Georgia to try and find you. Cause I can't leave it, leave it all behind. Sayin everything but blaming it was you. That's what I'm gonna do
That's what I gotta do
