Honeywine, you're a sight to see
Auburn hair, runnin' 'round in bare feet
Cheap sunglasses and your turquoise ring
Wonderin' what you'd see in a guy like me
Well, Honeywine, you're a sight to see
Do you recall how you got that name?
Drank that shit 'til 3 a.m
Sang John Prine songs, sang harmony
The night you got the best of me
Well, Honeywine, you're a sight to see

'Cause you're the sweetest thing that I've ever known
When the beer runs out and the whiskey's gone
Honeywine, you're all I need
Well, Honeywine, you're all I need

Honeywine, we've got big plans
To put some shoes on your feet, take the turquoise off your hand
Trade it out for a diamond ring
It's a kiss under a cottonwood tree
I get down on one knee
Said "Honeywine, won't you marry me?
Let's do somethin' crazy, go on and marry me"

'Cause you're the sweetest thing that I've ever known
When the beer runs out and the whiskey's gone
Honeywine, you're all I need
Well, Honeywine, you're all I need
Honeywine, you're the one for me
Well, Honeywine, you're all I need
