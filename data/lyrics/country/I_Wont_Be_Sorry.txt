I won’t be sittin’ ‘round somewhere
Talkin’ ‘bout everything I wish I’d done
And I won’t be standing on the sidelines
Wishin’ I’d had just a little more fun
And I won’t be kickin’ myself
For the ship that sailed without me
Someday I’m gonna look back
With a couple of scars
And a few good stories
Someday if I’m gonna go out
Then I’m gonna go out in a blaze of glory
And I won’t be sorry
I wanna be holdin’ that candle
With both ends burning when the flame burns out
And I wanna be slingin’ that gravel
Runnin’ on empty with the pedal down
And I wanna be livin’ it up
Still pushing my luck with no regrets
Someday I’m gonna look back
With a couple of scars
And a few good stories
Someday if I’m gonna go out
Then I’m gonna go out in a blaze of glory
And I won’t be sorry
Someday I’m gonna look back
With a couple of scars
And a few good stories
Someday if I’m gonna go out
Then I’m gonna go out in a blaze of glory
And I won’t be sorry
No tears for me no apologizes
No wishing I’d done what they told me
Someday I’m gonna look back
With a couple of scars
And a few good stories
Someday if I’m gonna go out
Then I’m gonna go out in a blaze of glory
And I won’t be sorry
Someday I’m gonna look back
With a couple of scars
And a few good stories
Someday if I’m gonna go out
Then I’m gonna go out in a blaze of glory
And I won’t be sorry
