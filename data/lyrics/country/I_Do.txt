When you go downtown, do you slow down
On a Friday, midnight, windows rolled down?
Does a song ever make you miss a green light?
Do you ever wish you were still mine?

'Cause I do, yeah, I do
Oh, I do think about you
Yeah, it’s true, oh, it's true
Yeah, I do, girl, it's no use
What really hurts is I’d say the words
You always wanted me to
I do, yeah, I do
Oh, I do still think about you

You see a ring on some girl's finger
Does it make you think just how close we were?
To a walk down the aisle, making your mama smile
DO you think about that every once in a while?

'Cause I do, yeah, I do
Oh, I do think about you
Yeah, it's true, oh, it's true
Yeah, I do, girl, it's no use
What really hurts is I'd say the words
You always wanted me to
I do, yeah, I do
Oh, I do still think about you
Still think about you

I don't know what to say, what I gotta say to make it right
I don’t know where to go when I’m alone
And it's like all I do is regret it
Well, I shoulda just said it

’Cause I do, yeah, I do
Oh, I do think about you
Yeah, it's true, oh, it's true
Yeah, I do, girl, it's no use
What really hurts is I’d say the words
You always wanted me to
I do, yeah, I do
Oh, I do, I still think about you
'Cause I do, yeah, I do
Oh, I do think about you (Still think about you)
Yeah, it's true, oh, it's true
Yeah, I do, girl, it's no use (It's no use, it's no use)
What really hurts is I'd say the words (Oh, oh)
You always wanted me to
I do, yeah, I do (Yeah, I do, oh, I do)
Oh, I do, I still think about you
