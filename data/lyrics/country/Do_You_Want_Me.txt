Do you want me like I want you?
Do you wonder if I sleep alone at night?
I woke up early yesterday morning
I woke up with you still on my mind
Who am I to be your angel?
Who am I if not your friend?
Who am I if I知 all alone?
Wake me up if I知 dreaming again
Do you need me like I need you?
Do you know how it feels to be this low?
I知 sorry, oh how I知 sorry
For I have learned just how little that I know
Who am I to be your angel?
Who am I if not your friend?
Who am I if I知 all alone?
Wake me up if I知 dreaming again
Do you thank god like I thank his?
Do you thank god for the place he tied us to?
To a new place I have awoken
And everything I know of love I learned from you
Who am I to be your angel?
Who am I if not your friend?
Who am I if I知 all alone?
Wake me up if I知 dreaming again
Wake me up if I知 dreaming again
Do you want me like I want you?
Do you think about me lying by your side?
I wake up often still in mourning
Because I know how I have felt much more alive
Who am I to be your angel?
Who am I if not your friend?
Who am I if I知 all alone?
Wake me up if I知 dreaming
Wake me up if I知 dreaming
Wake me up if I知 dreaming again
