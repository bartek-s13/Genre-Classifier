I'm on that Knob Creek hundred proof off in the kitchen
I got my old 45 and the only thing missin'
Is a piece of my heart, she took when she left
The hurt and the pain I'm gonna drink 'em to death
Pictures on the wall, every echos and all
Bottle 'em up, gonna sip 'til I fall
She never came home, won't answer my call
It's time to put an end to it all

Won't you be my, won't you be my little whiskey valentine
And all these whiskey memories remind me of when you were mine
Must of done wrong, 'cause you're long gone
And I'm missin' you tonight
And now all you're ever gonna be is my whiskey valentine

I'm about at my limit, and my cup runith over
It's a long shot from home, I'm a long way from sober
Whiskey bent in the truck thinkin' this over
Memories makin' my heart grow colder
Temp runnin' high with the windows low
On the way to find what's left of my soul
I ride 95 down this dead end road
Pedal to the metal 'cause I'm out of control

Won't you be my, won't you be my little whiskey valentine
And all these whiskey memories remind me of when you were mine
Must of done wrong, 'cause you're long gone
And I'm missin' you tonight
And now all you're ever gonna be is my whiskey valentine

You wanna be his, well he better lay low
'Cause the next thing he sees might be the last thing he knows
Yeah, if you wanna be his, well he better lay low
'Cause there ain't no limit to how far I might go

Won't you be my, won't you be my little whiskey valentine
And all these whiskey memories remind me of when you were mine
Must of done wrong, 'cause you're long gone
And I'm missin' you tonight
And now all you're ever gonna be is my whiskey valentine
Won't you be my, won't you be my little whiskey valentine
And all these whiskey memories remind me of when you were mine
Must of done wrong, 'cause you're long gone
And I'm missin' you tonight
And now all you're ever gonna be is my whiskey valentine
And now all you're ever gonna be is my whiskey valentine
