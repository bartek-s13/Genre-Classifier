I've been throwing horseshoes over my left shoulder
I've spent most of my life searching for that four leaf clover
Yet you run with me chasing my rainbow
Honey I love you too that's the way love goes

That's the way love goes babe that's the music God made
For the whole wide world to sing it never gets old it only grows
Losing makes me sorry you say, "Honey don't worry"
Honey I love you too that's the way love goes
Honey I love you too that's the way love goes
