I'm the center of attention in this barroom
Cause I've got a biggest heartache of the year
And each night those swinging doors reach out for me and draw me in
'Cause they know each night that I'll come back to wine me up again
Wine me up, turn me on and watch me cry for you
Lately drinking warm red wine is all I want to do
And I never know how tight I'll wine me up till I walk in
But I don't care cause I'll be back to wine me up again
I'd like to thank the men that raise the grapes way out in California
And I'm hoping this will be their biggest year
'Cause scarlet water's all that's left to keep me hanging on
And that's why I'll try to wine me up each day and night next year
Wine me up turn me on and watch me cry for you
Lately drinking warm red wine is all I want to do
And I never know how tight I'll wine me up till I walk in
But I don't care cause I'll be back to wine me up again...
