Something ‘bout a ball cap, flipped back
On a beautiful girl in the settin’ sun
In a lawn chair, with a cold beer
Cut off jeans and her Ray Ban’s on
Been waitin’ all day for a chance to say

Hey girl, do you wanna
Take the night a little further
Down a road noone goes
Til we start runnin’ out of fence posts
Just you and me alone and
Then we’ll get to hoppin’ out the truck
And get to droppin’ a blanket on the ground, let your hair down
And we can get to rollin’ around in the hay girl
(Just a rollin’ around in the hay girl)

I wouldn’t be upset if we never left
Cuz anytime with you is time well spent
But by the look in your eyes, you’re comin’ alive
So no point in stayin’ here, when we can disappear

Hey girl, do you wanna
Take the night a little further
Down a road noone goes
Til we start runnin’ out of fence posts
Just you and me alone and
Then we’ll get to hoppin’ out the truck
And get to droppin’ a blanket on the ground, let your hair down
And we can get to rollin’ around in the hay girl
(Just a rollin’ around in the hay girl)

Tryin’ to find us way out here
Is kinda like tryin’ to find a needle in
Hay girl (yeah, I said hey girl)

Hey girl, do you wanna
Take the night a little further
Down a road noone goes
Til we start runnin’ out of fence posts
Just you and me alone and
Then we’ll get to hoppin’ out the truck
And get to droppin’ a blanket on the ground, let your hair down
And we can get to rollin’ around in the hay girl
(Just a rollin’ around in the hay girl)
(Rollin’ around in the hay girl)
(Just a rollin’ around in the hay girl)
(Rollin’ around in the hay girl)
