Been at the house too many Friday nights
Spent my time sittin' on the sidelines
It’s true I guess, I ain't been at my best since you left girl
Tryna like hell to get myself back on track
It's just the way it goes, you’re only down and out 'til you bounce back
Lettin' go of you was the hardest thing to do but tonight girl

I think I'm finally movin' on
Yeah, I finally got you gone
I'm feelin' no pain, forgettin' your name
Yeah, I’m finally gettin’ over you
Finally ready for somebody new
It's funny how things change, I guess you can say
I’m back in the game

Friends callin' me up sayin' I'm gonna be alright
Didn’t really believe 'em before tonight
Just took some time tryna get you off my mind girl

I think I'm finally movin' on
Yeah, I finally got you gone
I'm feelin' no pain, forgettin' your name
Yeah, I'm finally gettin' over you
Finally ready for somebody new
It's funny how things change, I guess you can say
I'm back in the game

For the first time in a long time
You're the last thing on my mind

I think I'm finally movin' on
Yeah, I finally got you gone, gone, gone
I'm feelin' no pain, forgettin' your name
Yeah, I'm finally gettin' over you
Finally ready for somebody new
It's funny how things change, I guess you can say
I'm back in the game
It's the first time in a long time
Yeah, I'm back in the game
It's the first time in a long time
I'm feelin' no pain
It's the first time in a long time
Yeah I'm back in the game
It's the first time in a long time
I'm back in the game
It's the first time in a long time
Funny how things change
I guess you can say I'm back in the game
