Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the biggest fool of all
I bet you could take a guess
All you gotta do is reflect
Mirror, mirror on the wall

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Well this just can't be it all
Have I taken things too far
And shattered her heart?
Mirror, mirror on the wall

I can't see
The world she's been dreaming
'Cause all that I see
Is that old red Chevy
And her leaving

So mirror, mirror on the wall
Show me her in the early fall
Back when her eyes ran deep
With all the love for me
Mirror, mirror on the wall

I can't see
The world she's been dreaming
'Cause all that I see
Is that old red Chevy
And her leaving

So mirror, mirror on the wall
Could you be my crystal ball?
Do I get her back where she belongs
Or am I a fool who stares too long
At the mirror on the wall?
