The summer air was heavy and sweet
You and I on a crowded street
There was music everywhere
I can see us there
In a happy little foreign town
Where the stars hung upside down
A half a world away
Far, far away

I remember
You were laughing
We were so in love
We were so in love

And the band played
Songs that we had never heard
But we danced anyway
We never understood the words
We just sang ohhh
La la la la la la la la
And we danced anyway

Well they say you can't go back
But baby I don't believe that
Come along with me
Come on and dance with me
Well maybe if I hold you close
Baby we could just let go
Of these things that tie us down
We'll come back around

You remember
We were laughing
We were so in love
So in love

And the band played
Songs that we had never heard
But we danced anyway
We never understood the words
We just sang ohhh
La la la la la la la la
And we danced anyway


You remember
We were laughing (we were so)
We were so in love (in love)
We were so in love

And the band played
Songs that we had never heard
But we danced anyway
We never understood the words
We just sang ohhh
La la la la la la la la
La la la ohhh ohhhh

Ohhhhhh
And we dance anyway (oh oh, we were laughing)
Ohhhhhh (oh oh)
And we danced anyway (oh oh, we were dancing)
(Oh oh)
