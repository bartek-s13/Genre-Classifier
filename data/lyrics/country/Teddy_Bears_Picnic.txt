If you go out in the woods today
You're sure of a big surprise
If you go out in the woods today
You'd better go in disguise
For every bear that ever there was
Will gather there for certain because
Today's the day the teddy bears have their picnic

Picnic time for teddy bears
The little teddy bears are having a lovely time today
Watch them
Catch them unawares
And see them picnic on their holiday
See them gaily gapped about
They love to play and shout
They never have any cares
At six o'clock their mommies and daddies
Will take them home to bed
Because they're tired little teddy bears
If you go out in the woods today
You'd better not go alone
It's lovely out in the woods today
But safer to stay at home
For every bear that ever there was
Will gather there for certain, because
Today's the day the teddy bears have their picnic

Every teddy bear, who's been good
Is sure of a treat today
There's lots of wonderful things to eat
And wonderful games to play
Beneath the trees, where nobody sees
They'll hide and seek as long as they please
Cause the day the teddy bears have their picnic
