My first love was a wicked twisted road
I hit the million-mile mark at seventeen years old
I never saw the rainbow, much less a pot of gold
Yeah, my first love was a wicked twisted road

My first love was a castle in the sky
Never thought I'd make it 'til I had the guts to try
Then I sat up in my tower while the whole world passed me by
Yeah, my first love was a castle in the sky


My first love was a fearless drivin' rain
Scared to death I thought I'd never see her face again
They say God was cryin' so I guess he felt my pain
My first love was a fearless drivin' rain

My first love was a wild sinful night
I ran out with the big dogs, guess I had more bark than bite
I know I won the battle, but in the end I lost the fight
Yeah, my first love was a wild sinful night

My first love was an angry, painful song
I wanted one so bad I went and did everything wrong
A lesson in reality would come before too long
Yeah, my first love was an angry, painful song

My first love was a wicked twisted road
I hit the million-mile mark at seventeen years old
I never saw the rainbow, much less a pot of gold
Yeah, my first love was a wicked twisted road

My first love was a wicked twisted road
