When I was sixteen, that set of keys was a pair of wings
Daddy, pretty please, can I take a ride tonight?
I swear I won't get her over fifty-five
Was Back in Black racing through my veins, last thing I thought
Was a flip in this thing gonna get me killed
I'm pretty sure my old man will
And seeing his face when the wrecker hauled my freedom away
That's how I learned to pray
It wasn't in a church, with a chapter and a verse
Some preacher made sure everybody heard
Or just some words somebody taught me to say
I was living like I was (?), mama always said
It'd take a special girl to get a hold of me
But I never let one get close to me
The man upstairs must've heard her prayer
Cause I looked up, you were standin' there waitin' on me
Like you were made for me
And I knew right then and there, I'd been saved
And that's how I learned to pray
It wasn't in a church, with a chapter and a verse
Some preacher made sure everybody heard
Or just some words somebody taught me to say
I can fold my hands and bow my head
But there's just some things that can't be said
Without a little walk on water kind of faith
And that's how I learned to pray
Have you ever looked up at the stars in the sky, felt a tug at your heart
Didn't know why but you just knew
Someone is up there lookin' out for you
Well you know just what I mean when I say Grace
That's how I learned to pray
That's how I learned to pray
