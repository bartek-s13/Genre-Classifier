T for Texas, T for Tennessee
T for Texas, T for Tennessee
T for Thelma, that gal that made a wreck out of me

Oh-del-lay-ee oh, lay-ee eh, lay-ee

If you don't want me mama, you sure don't have to stall, oh Lord
If you don't want me mama, you sure don't have to stall
'Cause I can get more women than a passenger train can haul

Oh-del-lay-ee oh, lay-ee eh, lay-ee

I'm gonna buy me a pistol just as long as I'm tall, Lord Lord
I'm gonna buy me a pistol just as long as I'm tall
I'm gonna shoot poor Thelma just to see her jump and fall

Oh-del-lay-ee eh, lay-ee oh, lay-ee

I'm goin' where the water drinks like cherry wine, sing 'em boy sing 'em
Lord I'm goin' where the water drinks like cherry wine
'Cause this Georgia water tastes like turpentine
Oh-del-lay-ee eh, lay-ee oh, lay-ee

I'm gonna buy me a shotgun with a great long shiny barrel
Gonna buy me a shotgun with a great long shiny barrel
I'm gonna shoot that rounder that stole away my gal

Oh-del-lay-ee eh, lay-ee oh, lay-ee

Rather drink muddy water sleep in a holler log
Rather drink muddy water sleep in a holler log
Than to be in Atlanta treated like a dirty dog

Oh-del-lay-ee eh, lay-ee oh, lay-ee
