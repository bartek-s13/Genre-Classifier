I lived my life like a gypsy
And I called a lot of gypsies my friend
I embrace each moment for the moment
Then I let 'em all go with the wind
Girl, I never let this feelin' I'm feelin'
Carry me so far away

I'm a long way from home
And the night's almost gone
But your love makes me wanna stay
And deep down there's somethin'
That just keeps me runnin'
But your love makes me wanna stay
Your love makes me wanna stay

There's a freedom for me in your laughter
A freedom that I never knew
And maybe it's what I've been after
Girl, I've always been runnin' to you
I believe in this feelin' I'm feelin'
You carry me so far away

I'm a long way from home
And the night's almost gone
But your love makes me wanna stay
And deep down there's somethin'
That just keeps me runnin'
But your love makes me wanna stay
Your love makes me wanna stay

I'm a long way from home
And the night's almost gone
But your love makes me wanna stay
And deep down there's somethin'
That just keeps me runnin'
But your love makes me wanna stay

I'm a long way from home
And the night's almost gone
But your love makes me wanna stay
And deep down there's somethin'
That just keeps me runnin'
But your love makes me wanna stay
Your love makes me wanna stay
Makes me wanna stay
