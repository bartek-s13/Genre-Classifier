I like my ice cream in a bowl
I like my ice cream in a bowl
Can't get enough to save my soul
But it ain't like Jelly Roll

I love Corinna, long and tall
I love my momma, long and tall
Baby can make a wildcat squall
Got the best jelly roll of all

Momma's got dem lovin' ways
Momma's got dem lovin' ways
Give her rope and watch her play
Jelly Roll's gettin' better every day


Many a night I've walked the floor
Many a night I've walked the floor
Walked the floor from door to door
Jelly Roll, where did you go?

When I'm gettin' grey and old
When I'm gettin' grey and old
Listen while I get you told
I'll still take Jelly Roll


My gal's worth her weight in gold
Momma's worth her weight in gold
You can have the weight and have the gold
But give me the jelly roll

Got dat jelly roll on my mind
I got dat jelly roll on my mind
Run me crazy and drove me blind
Jelly Roll's gettin' better all the time
