You never felt this way
Yeah, you never fall this far
You never believed in love at first sight
Until tonight when I walked in this bar

Liar, liar
Womanizer
Bargain bin
Romanticizer
Spin your web just like a spider does
Pants on fire
Flames get higher
Liar, liar

You don't play games
Don't mind sleeping alone
That waitress who just winked at you
Is just some crazy girl you used to know

Liar, liar
Womanizer
Bargain bin
Romanticizer
Spin your web just like a spider does
Pants on fire
Flames get higher
Liar, liar
Some might say that you're no good for nothing
But I can tell right now you're good at something

Liar, liar
Womanizer
Bargain bin
Romanticizer
Spin your web just like a spider does
Pants on fire
Flames get higher

Liar, liar
Womanizer
Bargain bin
Romanticizer
Spin your web just like a spider does
Pants on fire
Flames get higher
Liar, liar

Liar, liar
Liar, liar
