I wish you were a pack of cigarettes
Cause you would of come with a warning
Before I let you steal my breath
I woulda known how bad you were for me

Some people lie
Some people trust
Some people hide
What they're made of

If you woulda been lit up like a marquee sign
Coulda saved myself some wasted time
From the minute I found you
If it’d been written out in black and white
Maybe then I would have told my mind
Not to get wrapped around you
I should have known it from the start
You were only here to break my heart
{Verse 2]
If you had just been tequila
I would've known when to stop
Woulda been so easy to leave ya
Never even woulda taken a shot
But people lie
And people trust
And people hide
What they're made of

If you woulda been lit up like a marquee sign
Coulda saved myself some wasted time
From the minute I found you
If it’d been written out in black and white
Maybe then i would have told my mind
Not to get wrapped around you
I should have known it from the start
You were only here to break my heart
Lit up like a marquee sign
Lit up like a marquee sign

If I could have seen right through ya
Known ya before I knew ya

If you woulda been lit up like a marquee sign
Coulda saved myself some wasted time
From the minute I found you
If it’d been written out in black and white
Maybe then i would have told my mind
Not to get wrapped around you
I should have known it from the start
You were only here to break my heart
Yeah, you were only here to break my heart
Lit up like a marquee sign
Woah, oh
Lit up like a marquee sign
Woah, oh
Lit up like a marquee sign
Woah, oh, hey
Lit up like a marquee sign
Woah, oh
