Well, I could just sit around
Makin' music all day long
Long as I'm makin' music
I know I couldn't do nobody wrong
And who knows, maybe someday
I'll come up with a song
It makes people want to stop
All their fussin' and fightin'
Just long enough to sing along
I believe in music, I believe in love
Music is love and love is music
If you know what I mean
And people who believe in music
Are the happiest people I've ever seen
So clap your hands and stomp your feet
And shake your tambourine
Lift your voices to the sky
God loves you when you sing
Everybody sing
I, I believe in music, I believe in love
Sing it through me children
I, I believe in music, God knows that I believe in love
Music is the universal language
And love is the key
To brotherhood and peace
And understanding and livin' in harmony
So take your brother by the hand
Let's sing along with me
Find out what it really means
To feel young and rich everyday
Everybody sing
I, I believe in music, oh, know that, I, oh, I believe in love
Sing it through me children
I, I believe in music, God knows, I believe in love
I believe in music, God knows that I believe in love
Sing it all together
I believe in music, God knows that I believe in love
I believe in music, God knows that I believe in love
Sing it all together now
I believe in music
