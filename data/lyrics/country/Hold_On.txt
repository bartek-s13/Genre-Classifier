When you're afraid
I'm right beside you
When you're in the dark
I'll come and find you
There is no door
I'll leave unopened
And there is no chance
I'll leave it broken
So, hold on, hold on
Don't let go
Hold on, hold on
I'll be your hope
I'll be your lifeline
I'll never stop fighting
So hold on, hold on
Hold on to me
Hold on to me
If there's a prayer
I'm gonna pray it
When there's an answer
I'll be right here waiting
And there ain't a stone I won't turn over
A weight too heavy on my shoulder
A fire that I won't walk through
You know I got you, I got you
So hold on, hold on
And don't let go
Hold on, hold on
I'll be your hope
I'll be your lifeline
I'll never stop fighting
Believing
So hold on, hold on
Hold on to me, yeah
Hold on to me, yeah
Don't know if you're listening
But if you can here me
Just hold on, hold on
And don't let go
Hold on, hold on
I'll be your hope
I'll be your lifeline
And I'll never stop fighting
Believing
So hold on, hold on
Hold on to me
