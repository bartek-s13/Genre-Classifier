I got whiskey
Hundred proof
I got whiskey
One hundred proof
And if I drink enough
Then the thinking ain't so rough
So who needs you?
Uh huh, who needs you?

I got money
That I ain't spent
I got money honey
I can pay my rent
I can't buy no diamonds rings
But I can buy the important things
So who needs you?
You hear me talking, who needs you?
Who needs you?
Who needs you?
Who needs you?
Who needs you?

I got a lover
Another lover, yeah
I got a lover
Another lover
Well he ain't the best I've had
Oh, but that don't make him bad
So who needs you?
Who, who needs you?
Who needs you?
Who needs you?
Who needs you?
Who needs you?
Okay, I've got a little disclaimer here
Don't wanna offend anyone
But just remember this is legal in some places

Well I've been smokin'
Just a little toke
I've been smokin' baby
I've rolled my own
And if I'd stayed stoned
I don't mind being alone
So who needs you?
Who needs you?
Who needs you?
Who needs you?
Who needs you?
Who needs you?
Who needs you?
Who needs you?
Who needs you?
