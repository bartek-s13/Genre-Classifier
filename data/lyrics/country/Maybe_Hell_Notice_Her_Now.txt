She wrote I feel just like that painting
Collectin' dust on the wall
And every day you walk right by me
And don't know I'm there at all
And I can't think of one single reason
Why I should be hangin around
She signed it
"I hope that you'll miss me"
Then she drove herself outta town

Maybe he'll notice her now
Maybe he'll open his eyes
Sometimes it takes somebody leavin
For a man to realize
Maybe he'll tell her she's the only thing
That he can't live without
Now that she's gone
Maybe he'll notice her now

When he came home late that evenin
He called her name down the hall
He saw the outline of the painting
That used to hang there on the wall
And in its place on the nail was the letter
He read it out loud to himself
Then the loneliness began to take over
And for once he knew just how she felt

Maybe he'll notice her now
Maybe he'll open his eyes
Sometimes it takes somebody leavin
For a man to realize
Maybe he'll tell her she's the only thing
That he can't live without
Now that she's gone
Maybe he'll notice her now

He called her up, he said I have been such a fool
She said I will come back and boy I still love you

Maybe he'll notice her now
Maybe he'll open his eyes
Sometimes it takes somebody leavin
For a man to realize
Maybe he'll tell her she's the only thing
That he can't live without
Now that she's gone
Maybe he'll notice her now
I'm comin home
Maybe you'll notice me now
