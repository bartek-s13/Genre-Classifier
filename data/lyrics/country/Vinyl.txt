If our love was a song, girl
I'd play it all night long, girl
I tell you what I'd put it on, girl
I'd put it on vinyl
A little rock, a little Motown
You got that baby pull me close sound
You make the whole room go 'round
And 'round like vinyl

What we got is a little old-fashioned
Baby you're an instant classic
They don't make 'em no more like you
So, let the needle drop and play it all night
Might have a little static but it's alright
Ain't nothin' gonna stop this groove

You know you got the real thing
The whole world oughta know your name
Like a band in the hall of fame
On vinyl
Go on and let your hair fall, girl
Oh, you're beautiful you got it all, girl
I'd hang the cover on the wall, girl
Just like vinyl

What we got is a little old fashioned
Baby you're an instant classic
They don't make 'em no more like you
So let the needle drop and play it all night
Might have a little static but it's alright
Ain't nothin' gonna stop this groove, no

Let the needle drop and play it all night
Might have a little static but it's all right
Ain't nothin' gonna stop our groove, no
If our love was a song, girl
I'd play it all night long, girl
I tell you what I'd put it on, girl
I'd put it on vinyl

When you say my name it's the sweetest sound
Aw girl you got me spinnin' 'round and 'round like vinyl
Like vinyl
Ain't nothin' gonna stop this groove
No they don't make 'em no more like you
Like vinyl
