Mistakes we're gonna make 'em
Chances gonna take 'em
Walls try and break 'em down
Time we're gonna steal it
Love like a drug gonna deal it
That high I wanna feel it, now
I've been talking to the stars
Been reaching through the dark
Been holding out my heart

Do you ever lay awake at night, staring up at a lonely sky
Wondering if it's gonna drop on you, like a rock on you
Yeah I do too
Do you ever wanna run away, get scared you'll lose your faith
Like it's all gonna stop on you, walk out on you
Yeah I do too
We all got more questions than answers, dreams too big too lose
Sometimes you worry too much
Yeah I do too

Everybody's got beautiful, we all got scars
Why hide behind a filter, you're a perfect work of art
What on earth are we here for
What happens next
For all the things I think I know
There's so much I don't get
Do you ever lay awake at night, staring up at a lonely sky
Wondering if it's gonna drop on you, like a rock on you
Yeah I do too
Do you ever wanna run away, get scared you'll lose your faith
Like it's all gonna stop on you, walk out on you
Yeah I do too
We all got more questions than answers, dreams too big too lose
Sometimes you worry too much
Yeah I do too

I've been up all night just steady shouting at the ceiling
Staring down my demons, need something to believe in
I've been up all night just steady shouting at the ceiling
Staring down my demons, need something to believe in
Something to believe in

Do you ever lay awake at night, staring up at a lonely sky
Wondering if it's gonna drop on you, like a rock on you
Yeah I do too
Do you ever wanna run away, get scared you'll lose your faith
Like it's all gonna stop on you, walk out on you
Yeah I do too
We all got more questions than answers, dreams too big too lose
Sometimes you worry too much
Yeah I do too
Yeah I do too
