There was a tall oak tree that loved a bubblin' brook
And the bubblin' brook loved a mountain high
And the mountain high loved the sky above
The creator looked down and saw everything was loved loved loved
Then he picked up a bone and a piece of mud
He made a man and a woman to be flash and blood
Then along came a devil up bottom ground
He tempted woman and that's spred sin all around all around all around
If she'd've left that apple in that apple tree
There'd be no tears and sorrow we'd live eternaly
Then along came man to burn the oak tree down
And the bubblin' brook was a solid ground
And the mountain high don't stand so high
And there's a cloud of smoke that covers up a clear blue sky
There was a tall oak tree there was a tall oak tree
There was a tall oak tree there was a tall oak tree
