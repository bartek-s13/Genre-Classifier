5 AM  out the door
Eight hour, maybe more
Starin' me down
Hatin' work, haulin' dirt
Man this shit's just been wearin' me out
Off at two, nothin' to do
Calls that girl don't get off 'til five
But I'll have a bottle of waitin'
And it's on when she pulls in the drive
When she comes home tonight
We'll take that clock off the wall
Draw all them curtains
Let our clothes just lay where they fall
We'd turn down the lights
And let our hands be our eyes
Be just her and I, we'll take our time
When she comes home tonight
Been a while overdue
Gettin' her alone
Thought's been drivin' me wild
Killin' time 'til her and I get back to lovin' like it's goin' out of style
I'm staring at this bottle awake
But it's on when she pulls in the drive
When she comes home tonight
We'll take that clock off the wall
Draw all them curtains
Let our clothes just lay where they fall
We'd turn down the lights
And let our hands be our eyes
Be just her and I, we'll take our time
When she comes home tonight
When she comes home tonight
We'll take that clock off the wall
Draw all them curtains
Let our clothes just lay where they fall
We'd turn down the lights
And let our hands be our eyes
Be just her and I, we'll take our time
When she comes home tonight
