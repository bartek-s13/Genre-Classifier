Never thought I needed anyone
Or anything to get me through
Come to close and then I'd start to run
Just to stay one step ahead of you
I'd see others walking hand and hand
And say to say to myself "what a couple of fools"
How could one woman just love one man?
And not tear his heart in two
Fools chase love around so desperately
Until they wind up all alone
Shouldn't love come more naturally
Like a river cuts into a stone
That's why I
I love you for loving me
It's a rare and precious thing
You can't run from love that's meant to be
Just let it shine on everything
Oh It took a little while
But I found myself
Right where I did not need to be
I tried to put the blame on someone else
When it all came crashing all down on me
That's why I
I love you for loving me
It's a rare and precious thing
You can't run from love that's mean to be
So let it shine on everything
Oh let it shine on everything, Yea
