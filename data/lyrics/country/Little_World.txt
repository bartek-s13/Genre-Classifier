They say you don't know until you've had your own
Found out what that meant the day I brought you home
Had the whole world in my hands for the very first time
Those wild and crazy nights and days have come and gone
Used to not come home 'til the white lights came on
Now it's night lights and lullabies, don't wanna miss a kiss goodnight
'Cause even when she's fussin' I wouldn't trade it all for nothin'

That smile can bring a grown man down
Every time you've got me tightly wrapped around
Those little curls and blue eyes
I knew I was in for it now
I know what I can't be without
I found what this life is all about
And I'm feelin' like I'm winnin'
Lovin' every minute
Livin' in your little world

As you're gettin' older there'll be ups and down
But I'll be that shoulder when you need to let it out
Know that you'll always be the sweetest part of me
'Cause even when you're all grown, out there on your own
You can always come home to me
That smile can bring a grown man down
Every time you've got me tightly wrapped around
Those little curls and blue eyes
I knew I was in for it now
I know what I can't be without
I found what this life is all about
And I'm feelin' like I'm winnin'
Lovin' every minute
Livin' in your little world

And on that day when I'm not around
From the stars I'll be lookin' down
Know that I'm still right here livin'
In your little world

That smile can bring a grown man down
Every time you've got me tightly wrapped around
Those little curls and blue eyes
I knew I was in for it now
I know what I can't be without
I found what this life is all about
And I'm feelin' like I'm winnin'
Lovin' every minute
Livin' in your little world
