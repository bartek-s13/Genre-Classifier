Well I've been watching you stare at the floor
That guy's got two left feet
I may be wrong but you must be bored
You look like someone who I'd like to meet
I could walk over and say hello but I think I need one more drink
Looks like you might be getting ready to go
Better find some words quick now let me think
Well if things don't work out by the next song
And you're looking for someone who can dance
I'll be right over there by the juke box, a quarter in my hand
Trying to buy myself a chance
Saw my reflection in an empty glass so I rehearse my lines
Say I ain't looking for trouble, I know you came in here with him tonight
Well if things don't work out by the next song
And you're looking for someone who can dance
I'll be right over there by the juke box with a quarter in my hand
Trying to buy myself a chance
Well here goes nothing I hope for something
I'm walking now across the floor
I cross my fingers, I tap your shoulder and I say I've never done this before
But if things don't work out by the next song
And you're looking for someone who can dance
I'll be right over there by the juke box
But if things don't work out by the next song
And you're looking for someone who can dance
I'll be right over there by the jukebox, quarter in my hand
Trying to buy myself a chance
