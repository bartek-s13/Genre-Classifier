No I ain't got to left feet, but that girl makes me think that I do
By the way that she moves on the floor
Oh I can hardly stand sittin' here on the side
Watchin' her spin around and around under that neon light

She got them blue bells on, dancin' along
She don't take a break, no she don't skip a song
High steppin' her way to what the DJ plays
I ain't seen her turn down a dance all day
Well I'm over here drinkin'
Sittin' here thinkin'
Dreamin' 'bout her hand in my hand
Well that girl makes me wish I could dance

I usually come in here, have a couple beers
Raise some hell with the guys, like every Friday night
Oh it's all the same, she's got me feelin' like
I'm missin' out on a good time
Maybe in a round or two I'll get the nerve to
Ask her for a try, but on second though though
Look at her go

She got them blue bells on, dancin' along
She don't take a break, no she don't skip a song
High steppin' her way to what the DJ plays
I ain't seen her turn down a dance all day
Well I'm over here drinkin'
Sittin' here thinkin'
Dreamin' 'bout her hand in my hand
Well that girl makes me wish I could dance
She got them blue bells on
Dancin' along

She got them blue bells on, dancin' along
She don't take a break, no she don't skip a song
High steppin' her way to what the DJ plays
I ain't seen her turn down a dance all day
Well I'm over here drinkin'
Sittin' here thinkin'
Dreamin' 'bout her hand in my hand
Well that girl
Well that girl makes me wish I could dance
Makes me wish I could dance
