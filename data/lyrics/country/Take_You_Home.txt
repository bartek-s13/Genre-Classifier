I know I just met you (Met you)
Been talking your ears off (Ears off)
But I wanna know everything (Everything)
And I got all night long (All night long)
Are you tryna be someone for someone?
'Cause you remind me of where I come from
So boy, I know it's kinda soon (Know it's kinda soon)
But I'll tell you what I wanna do

I wanna take you home
And I ain't talkin' about a two mile ride back to my place
Oh, this ain’t the same old song about two hearts hooking up
One and done, on a Friday
Naw boy, I’m talking about a map-dot town, nobody knows
That'll tell you everything you need to know
About me and why I talk like I do and why I'm falling for you
And why I take it slow
I wanna take you home
Yeah, I wanna take you home

Daddy's gonna love you (Love you)
He'll probably talk your ears off (Ears off)
Drive you by the little church (Little church)
That saved me when I got lost
Take you down roads that I grew up on
Wish on those stars that I used to wish on
Kiss you on the bleachers on the 50-yard line (50-yard line)
Boy, you know I...

I wanna take you home
And I ain't talkin' about a two mile ride back to my place
Oh, this ain't the same old...
Oh, this ain’t the same old song about two hearts hooking up
One and done, on a Friday
Naw boy, I’m talking about a map-dot town, nobody knows
That'll tell you everything you need to know
About me and why I talk like I do and why I'm fallin' for you
And why I take it slow
I wanna take you home
Yeah, I wanna take you home

Oh, I ain’t tryna jump the gun
Sure ain’t tryna make run
But the second I saw you, I knew I had to get you alone

I wanna take you home
And I ain't talkin' about a two mile ride back to my place
Oh, this ain't the same old...
Oh, this ain’t the same old song about two hearts hooking up
One and done, on a Friday
Naw boy, I’m talking about a map-dot town, nobody knows
That'll tell you everything you need to know
About me and why I talk like I do and why I'm fallin' for you
And why I take it slow
I wanna take you home
Yeah, I wanna take you home

And tell you about me and why I talk like I do
And why I'm fallin' for you
And why I take it slow
I wanna take you home
