Well the jingle in my pocket  ain’t as loud as I’d like
But the tickets are free on this dirt road ride
And we sure as hell don't have to wait in line to watch the sunset
Bare feet baby in the dance floor dust, K.C lights about to light it up
Yeah the way your looking's like a million bucks, it’s a hell yes
We'll make something outta nothing, take an old song and get it bumping
We'll take a beer can and get to buzzing, take a crush, and turn it up into a love thing
We’ll take a moment and make a memory, come on baby are you with me?
Yeah we ain’t got much but we got us tonight
We'll make something out of nothing
( Yeah, Yeah, Yeah )
Out here baby we can take it slow cos theres no bar tender calling out last call
We get high just getting real close cos anything, everything, anything goes
We'll make something outta nothing, take an old song and get it bumping
We'll take a beer can and get to buzzing, take a crush, and turn it up into a love thing
We’ll take a moment and make a memory, come on baby are you with me?
Yeah we ain’t got much but we got us tonight
We'll make something out of nothing
( Yeah, Yeah, Yeah )
We'll make something out of nothing
We'll make something out of nothing
We'll make something outta nothing, take an old song and get it bumping
We'll take a beer can and get to buzzing, take a crush, and turn it up into a love thing
We’ll take a moment and make a memory, come on baby are you with me?
Yeah we ain’t got much but we got us tonight
We'll make something out of, we’ll make something outta nothing
( Yeah, Yeah, Yeah )
