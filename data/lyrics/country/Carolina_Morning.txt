Girl when I left you my poor old heart was breaking
Because I know your love for me is right
But the sun will rise on you in Carolina
And it'll set on me in Tennessee tonight
I've had Carolina mornings and California nights
Good times and places in between
I'm bound to be alright
But it feels so good that it's understood
I'll show up without a warning
And I'll love you on a Carolina morning
Tomorrow I'll leave for California
After that I might go home to Idaho
But the sun will rise on you in Carolina
Yeah and where it sets on me I just don't know
I've had Carolina mornings, California nights
Good times and places in between
I'm bound to be alright
But it feels so good that it's understood
I'll show up without a warning
And I'll love you on a Carolina morning
Yeah, well maybe you can visit me in Nashville
Check out Music Row and Opryland and get to know my friends
But more than likely I'll just show up without a warning
And I'll love you on a Carolina morning
I've had Carolina mornings, California nights
Good times and places in between
I'm bound to be alright
But it feels so good that it's understood
I'll show up without a warning
And I'll love you on a Carolina morning
Yeah more than likely I'll just show up without a warning
And I'll love you on a Carolina morning
