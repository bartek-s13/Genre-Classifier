Fold your hands, bow your heads
There's an old time sayin' that's bein' said
There's a lesson to learn and a lot to see
There's nothin' more important than your family
Don't forget that boy
When you're off on your own
You got the same last name
And your mama loves you so
There's an old crow flyin' 'cross this fence line
Just flappin' his wings and wastin' time
Well what I would do if I could soar
Well this town might not see me anymore
What's the fun in that?
Where's a bird to go?
It's a manmade world
This is all he knows
Spread my wings, liftoff now
Leavin' solid ground
Think of me floatin' in the air
Like a shuttle in the atmosphere
Hold me close, love me right
See me burning through the night
Like a bird in flight
Like a bird in flight
You won't always know right from wrong
It's just somethin' you learn just like singin' a song
Well I'm tryin' to do the best I can
While learnin' to love and act like a man
Dear father protect this land
Bless my children, amen
Spread my wings, liftoff now
Leavin' solid ground
Think of me floatin' in the air
Like a shuttle in the atmosphere
Hold me close, love me right
See me burning through the night
Like a bird in flight
Like a bird in flight
Fold your hands, bow your heads
Dear father protect this land
Bless my children, amen
