I spend a lot of time alone
Maybe I think too much
Well I put on a hell of a show
Maybe I'm not that tough
Maybe I'm broken and twisted
Reckless and torn apart
Maybe I'm goin' all in
When I should be foldin' the cards
So you can take your number
And stand in line
The highest mountain
You have to climb
And it won't come easy
It'll take sometime
You wanna get close
To a heart like mine
A heart like mine
Yeah a heart like mine
Maybe I need you
Maybe I don't
Maybe I'll let you in
Oh but maybe I won't
And maybe I built this wall
Just to keep you out
Maybe you're strong enough
To tear it down
But you can take your number
And stand in line
The highest mountain
You have to climb
And it won't come easy
It'll take sometime
You wanna get close
To a heart like mine
A heart like mine
Yeah a heart like mine
So you can take your number
And stand in line
The highest mountain
You have to climb
And it won't come easy
It'll take sometime
You wanna get close
To a heart like mine
A heart like mine
Yeah a heart like mine
