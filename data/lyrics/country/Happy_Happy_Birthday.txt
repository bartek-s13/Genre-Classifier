Happy happy birthday baby although you're with somebody new
God I'd drop a line to say that I wish this happy day would find me beside you
Happy happy birthday baby no I can't call you my baby
Seems like years ago we met on a day I can't forget cause that's when we fell in love
Do you remember the names we had for each other
I was your pretty you were my baby how we could say goodbye
Hope I didn't spoil your birthday I'm not acting like a lady
So I'll close this note to you with good luck and wishes too happy happy birthday baby
Do you remember the names...
