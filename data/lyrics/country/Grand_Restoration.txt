Breaking ground
Nails to a board
Demolition of redemption
Glory-bound
Through the doors
Build my heart without condition
I hear it now
Oh the sound of the changes
Pieces antiquated
Time passed on
Carried through the ages
Living by the book
Written in the dust
Taking in a celebration
It’s all a part of the grand restoration
Lost and found
Trial by fire
Invitation to the table
When in doubt
Hope is higher
Your affliction will enable
You’re closer now
Oh the sound of the changes
Pieces antiquated
Time passed on
Carried through the ages
Living by the book
Written in the dust
Taking in a celebration
It’s all a part of the grand restoration
Oh the sound of the changes
Pieces antiquated
Time passed on
Carried through the ages
Living by the book
Written in the dust
Taking in a celebration
It’s all a part of the grand restoration
It’s all a part of the grand restoration
