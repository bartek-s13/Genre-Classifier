Brother afar from The Savior today
Risking your soul for the things that decay
Oh if today God should call you away
What would you give in exchange for your soul
What would you give (in exchange)
What would you give (in exchange)
What would you give in exchange for your soul
Oh if today God should call you away
What would you give in exchange for your soul
Mercy is calling you won't you give heed
Must the Dear Savior still tenderly plead
Risk not your soul it is precious indeed
What would you give in exchange for your soul
What would you give (in exchange)
What would you give (in exchange)
What would you give in exchange for your soul
Oh if today God should call you away
What would you give in exchange for your soul
More than all silver and gold of this earth
More than all jewels the spirit is worth
God The Creator has given it birth
What would you give in exchange for your soul
What would you give (in exchange)
What would you give (in exchange)
What would you give in exchange for your soul
Oh if today God should call you away
What would you give in exchange for your soul
