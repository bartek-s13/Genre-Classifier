I live a simple life
I work all day I sleep all night
A couple kids that need a nap
Big dog and a little cat
Wife that barks but rarely bites
So I live the simple life
I live a simple life
A good coat when the cold winds bite
Leather boots for my bare feet
Now and then a steak to eat
I pick with the boys on Friday night
So I live a simple life
My favorite book was wrote about
A man that died to save my soul
And my favorite thing to hear is
Daddy, I'm so glad you home
And my favorite woman is 5'3"
With long black hair and green eyes
Still I live a simple life
I live a simple life
Couple of friends I really like
A little house outside of town
An old car that gets me around
Complications may arise
But I live a simple life
And I live a simple life
Cell phone when my old car dies
The Internet to show me where
GPS to get me there
Everywhere there's satellites
Oh, I live a simple life
My favorite book was wrote about
A man that died to save my soul
And my favorite thing to hear is
Daddy, I'm so glad you home
And my favorite woman is 5'3"
With long black hair and green eyes
Still I live a simple life
