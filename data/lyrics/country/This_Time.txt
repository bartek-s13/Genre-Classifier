Oh, I'm gonna stop right now and call my mama
Gonna take a sick day when I'm feelin' gray
I'll keep my coffee black and sip my whisky, honest
Hold onto hope and let go of the hate

Life and love don't age like fine wine
There's no time to wait to taste the sweetest vine
Tomorrow's just a cape we hope will fly
Yesterday is Superman's kryptonite
So let's fill this cup and drink it up tonight
'Cause next time, there might not be a this time
Next time, this time

It's a heartbreaker I never saw Tom Petty
No, I won't back down and make that same mistake
I'm gonna say I'm sorry way before I'm ready
I'm gonna kiss you now, 'cause Heaven never waits

Life and love, they don't age like fine wine
There's no time to wait to taste the sweetest vine
Oh, tomorrow's just a cape we hope will fly
Yesterday is Superman's kryptonite
So let's fill this cup and drink it up tonight
'Cause next time, there might not be a this time
Next time, this time

Just hold me now (Hold me now)
I'll hold you now (Hold you now)
We'll slow dance while the world is spinnin' fast around

Life and love, they don't age like fine wine
There's no time to wait to taste the sweetest vine
Tomorrow's just a cape we hope will fly
Yesterday is Superman's kryptonite
So let's fill this cup and drink it up tonight
'Cause next time, there might not be a this time

There might not be a next time
This time, next time
There might not be a next time
This time, next time
There might not be a this time
Next time, this time
