Round here we ain't too fast pace
Slow e steady
Yeah it wins the race
So lets go steady baby
Take my hand
Are you ready baby
I know youre used to them
Big ol' cities
But damn girl ya shol' lookin pretty
In this swall town
Follow me
Let me show ya how to
Slow it down
Ya didn't know it then
But you know it now
Ya chillin with a kid
From the dirty south
The dirty south
I really like your smile
Dont mind this gold in my mouth
Lets hit them back roads
We can circle round town like a
Merry-go e you know its going down
Every where we go
Where we go
Girl ya movin' too fast
Get your foot off that gas e baby
Slow it down
