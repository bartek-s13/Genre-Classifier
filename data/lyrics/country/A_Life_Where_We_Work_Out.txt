In a life where we work out, there's a house up on a hill
A front porch going all of the way round and a, flower pot on the windowsill
We sit and watch the sunset while the kids play in the field
'Cause in a life where we work out, there's a house up on a hill

I still call you, "Darlin'", you still call me, "Babe"
I smile in the mirror when I say my new last name
You take me out dancin' on the weekend that you don't sing
'Cause in a life where we work out, you still call me, "Babe"

If life is only ups and downs
Maybe you'll come on back around
Save me from what I've become
Lord knows I can't keep losing sleep dreaming about
A life where we work out

Our love's still hotter than a Texas summer day
You still bite your lip when I look at you in that way
We pull off on some old dirt road on the way home 'cause we can't wait
'Cause in a life where we work out, our love's hotter than a summer day

If life is only ups and downs
Maybe you'll come on back around
Save me from what I've become
Lord knows I can't keep losing sleep dreaming about
A life where we work out
A life where we work out
