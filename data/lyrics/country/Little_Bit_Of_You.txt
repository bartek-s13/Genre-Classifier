I hope that I ain't callin too late baby
Hope you ain't close those pretty blue eyes
Have you looked out of your window lately
That moons taken up half of that sky

Whoa whoa
I'm a little bit restless
Can't get you off of my mind
Oh

I could use a little bit of your sweet kiss
Your lips on a night like this
I don't wanna be lonely with the stars all out
Need you here to help me or I might lose count
I could use a little bit of you right now
A little bit of you right now

Got my wheels pullin off that highway
My headlights pullin down your street
I got your song cranked up on the radio
But you ain't singing sittin next to me yeah

Whoa whoa
Girl I need you now
Walk on out
I could use a little bit of your sweet kiss
Your lips on a night like this
I don't wanna be lonely with the stars all out
Need you here to help me or I might lose count
I could use a little bit of you right now
Yeah

Oh I could use a little bit of your heart beat on mine
Your head on my chest all night long

I could use a little bit of your sweet kiss
Your lips on a night like this
I don't wanna be lonely with the stars all out
Need you here to help me or I might lose count
I could use a little bit of
Your love
Your smile
That thing you do that drives me wild
Your kiss
Your touch
I could use a little
I could use a little bit of you right now
I wanna put my arms around the little bit of you right now
