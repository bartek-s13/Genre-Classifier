You look at me and I can see
The feelings gone
What happen to the dream
We plan our future on
You turn away
And try to say
What we both know
But baby
I can't let you go
Let you go away
I don't wanna lose your love
I don't wanna be the one
Who's brokenhearted
Don't take the only love
I've ever known
I don't wanna lose your love
How could you go and stop
What we have started
Oh baby
I don't wanna be alone
I tried to hide
The pain inside
So plain to see
I never could keep secrets
From you anyway
So hard to face
I can't erase
The thoughts of you
But baby
Won't you change your mind
Change your mind and stay
I don't wanna lose your love
I don't wanna be the one
Who's brokenhearted
Don't take the only love
I've ever known
I don't wanna lose your love
How could you go and stop
What we have started
Oh baby
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna lose your love
I don't wanna be the one
Who's brokenhearted
Don't take the only love
I've ever known
I don't wanna lose your love
How could you go and stop
What we have started
Oh baby
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna lose your love
I don't wanna be the one
Who's brokenhearted
Don't take the only love
I've ever known
I don't wanna lose your love
How could you go and stop
What we have started
Oh baby
I don't wanna be alone
