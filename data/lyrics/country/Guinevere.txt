She's got a bumper like a billboard
Covered in stickers of her favorite band
She's got a handful of records that she turns to
When she needs to land
She's a Saturday night parade through the streets
That all eyes come to see including me
She carries memories around like souvenirs down in her pockets
She should have let some go by now but can't seem to drop it
Says forgiveness ain't nothing but a lifeless tire on the shoulder of her soul
That never rolls

For as much as she stumbled she's runnin'
For as much as she runs she's still here
Always hoping to find something quicker than heaven
To make the damage of her days disappear
Just like Guinevere
Oh, just like Guinevere

She don't hold onto nothin' new for very long
Yeah, she writes you in as just one more tale and then you're gone
'Cause she once fell hard 'cause she dropped her guard
And no one gets to stay, it's just too late
For as much as she stumbled she's runnin'
For as much as she runs she's still here
Always hoping to find something quicker than heaven
To make the damage of her days disappear
Just like Guinevere
Oh, just like Guinevere

For as much as she stumbled she's runnin'
For as much as she runs she's still here

For as much as she stumbled she's runnin'
For as much as she runs she's still here
Always hoping to find something quicker than heaven
To make the damage of her days disappear
Just like Guinevere
Oh, just like Guinevere

Oh, lean into me Guinevere
Be mine tonight Guinevere
