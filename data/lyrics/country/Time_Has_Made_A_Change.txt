Time has made a change since my childhood days
Many of my friends have gone away
Some I never more in this life shall see
Time has made a change in me
Time has made a change in the old home place
Time has made a change in each smiling face
And I know my friends can plainly see
Time has made a change in me
When I reach my home in that land somewhere
Meet my loved ones waitin' over there
Free from pain and care I shall ever be
Time has made a change in me
