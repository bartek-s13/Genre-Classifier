Never been the one for changing
Or ever hanging around
Got so used to always running
Never becoming tied down
Meeting you
It made me question where I stand right now

One foot in and one foot out
That's how it’s been until right now
I'm over all my lying and the leaving
I was selfish, unprepared
I can't blame you if you’re scared
But believe me, you're the girl that I've been needing
Chance is yours to take
My heart is yours to break
So put me in my place

Bet your friends could list some reasons
Why you should leave me tonight
I can't argue what they're saying
But I ain't caving this time
'Cause you're a different kind of feeling
That’s hitting me right now
One foot in and one foot out
That’s how it's been until right now
I’m over all my lying and the leaving
I was selfish, unprepared
I can't blame you if you're scared
But believe me, you're the girl that I’ve been needing
Chance is yours to take
My heart is yours to break
So put me in my place

I hope it's next to you
Tell me what to say
Show me what to do

One foot in and one foot out
Ain't the way I'm feeling now
I'm not lying when I promise I'm not leaving
I was selfish, unprepared
I can't blame you, I'm just as scared
But believe me, you're the girl that I've been needing
The chance is yours to take
My heart is yours to break
So put me in my place
Yeah the chance is yours to take
My heart is yours to break
So put me in my place
