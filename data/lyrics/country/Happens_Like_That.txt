You order a drink, it goes down smooth
Before you can blink, it turns into two
It was just gonna be another night with the boys
Shooting some pool, pickin' a stool and making some noise
Then she walks in and I never dance
Turns into tippin' the band, and taking her hand… ah man

It happens like that
Outta the blue sky, lost in her blue eyes
Yeah, when it happens like that
Nothing to lose turns right into you
Doing all you can do just to keep her around
Till the moon goes down and you're back at your house
One thing leads to another, you're loving each other
One look and you never look back
It happens like that
It happens like that

I guess that's what you get
It's true what they say
As soon as you stop looking, it's right in front of your face
Cause there you were and there I was and here we are, I tell you what
True love, it happens like that
Outta the blue sky, lost in her blue eyes
Yeah, when it happens like that
Nothing to lose turns right into you
Doing all you can do just to keep her around
Till the moon goes down and you're back at your house
One thing leads to another, you're loving each other
One look and you never look back
It happens like that, yeah


Ever wonder how
Just one drink
Turns into one knee down with a diamond ring

It happens like that
Outta the blue sky, lost in her blue eyes
Yeah, when it happens like that
Nothing to lose turns right into you
Doing all you can do just to keep her around
Till the moon goes down and you're back at your house
One thing leads to another, you're loving each other
One look and you never look back
It happens like that
You order a drink, it goes down smooth
Before you can blink, it turns into two
