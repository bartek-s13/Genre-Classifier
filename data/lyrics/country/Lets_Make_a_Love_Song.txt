Girl, why don't we get a little closer?
Just lay your head down on my shoulder
Turn all the lights low
Let's make a love song
I swear your heartbeat sounds like music
Why don't we slow dance in rhythm to it?
Soft as a whisper
Let's make a love song

We got all night
I've been thinking about you all day
Kinda like your favorite song
Yeah, I just want to let it play
And girl, you're like a radio tower in the midnight hour
Coming in loud and strong
I just wanna sing along
Let's make a love song

Kisses like a Motown record spinnin'
Baby, keep 'em coming
You got me listenin'
You're turning me on
Let's make a love song
We got all night
I've been thinking about you all day
Kinda like your favorite song
Yeah, I just want to let it play
And girl, you're like a radio tower in the midnight hour
Coming in loud and strong
I just wanna sing along
Let's make a love song
