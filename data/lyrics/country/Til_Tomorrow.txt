It's good to be out again, good to see all my friends
I had to get out of that house
Cause feeling sorry for myself, wasn't working out so well
Awe but baby look at me now
Well it took three months but better late than never
And to think I thought I would hurt forever

But baby tonight I'm alright yea I finally got you off my mind
I'm not here fighting back tears
I'm having the time of my life
Hell I may just stay out all damn night
You think I'm drowning in my sorrows
But I swear I'll never love you again til tomorrow

The hangover I'll go through, won't have nothing on you
So bartender, how 'bout another round?
Yea, I know that I'm ignoring all the warnings
But I'll worry about the morning in the morning

Cause baby tonight I'm alright yea I finally got you off my mind
I'm not here fighting back tears
I'm having the time of my life
Hell I may just stay out all damn night
You think I'm drowning in my sorrows
But I swear I'll never love you again til tomorrow

When this temporary whiskey fix is over
And it dawns on me that I need you when I'm sober
So maybe you're right, it's time
To get over you and get on with my life

But baby tonight I'm alright yea I finally got you off my mind
I'm not here fighting back tears
I'm having the time of my life
Hell I may just stay out all damn night
You think I'm drowning in my sorrows
But I swear that I'm not drowning in my sorrow
Girl I know I'll never love you again, til tomorrow
Til tomorrow
