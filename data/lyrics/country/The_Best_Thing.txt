I'm not afraid to say it
From the moment we met I felt it
Suddenly I was taken
Had a feeling it was something different
Out underneath those streetlights
I fell in deep for the first time
We were magic in the middle of a dream
I never want to leave

Take me back to seventeen
Just a taste of what we'd ever be
I don't know why I can't forget that night
'Cause you ain't even mine but you're the best thing
The best thing that ever happened to me

You drove back to Austin
And I took that late night flight
But baby if I'm being honest
It's like I never got back to real life
Guess I'm just stuck in the memory
I wonder if you ever miss me yeah
'Cause I keep looking for you in somebody else
I just can't help myself
Take me back to seventeen
Just a taste of what we'd never be
I don't know why I can't forget that night
'Cause you ain't even mine but you're the best thing
The best thing that never happened to me
Take me back to seventeen
Just a taste of what we'd never be
I don't know why I can't forget that night
'Cause you ain't even mine but you're the best thing
The best thing that ever happened to me
The best thing
The best thing that never happened to me
That never happened to me
