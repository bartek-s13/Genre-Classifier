WON'T YOU RIDE IN MY LITTLE RED WAGON
Writer Rex Griffin
Won't you ride in my little red wagon
I'd love to pull you down the street
I'll bet all the kids will be jealous
When they see my playmate so sweet
Hold tight till we come to the hilltop
Then we'll coast down the hill, you and me
Won't you ride in my little red wagon
For you are my sweetheart to be
Won't you ride in my little red wagon
I'd love to pull you down the street
I'll bet all the kids will be jealous
When they see my playmate so sweet
