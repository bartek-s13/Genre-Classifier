It must have been the mistletoe, the lazy fire, the falling snow
The magic in the frosty air that feeling everywhere
It must have been the pretty lights that glistened in the silent night
It may be just the stars so bright that shined above you
Our first Christmas more than we'd be dreaming of
Ah, St. Nicholas had his fingers crossed
That we would fall in love
It could have been the holiday, the midnight ride upon sleigh
The countryside all dressed in white, the crazy snowball fight
It could have been the steeple bell that wrapped us up in its spell
It only took one kiss to know it must have been the mistletoe
Our first Christmas more than we'd be dreaming of
Ah, St. Nicholas must have know that kiss
Would lead to all of this
It must have been the mistletoe, the lazy fire, the falling snow
The magic in the frosty air that made me love you
On Christmas eve our wish came true that I would fall in love with you
It only took one kiss to know it must have been the mistletoe
It must have been the mistletoe, it must have been the mistletoe
One kiss to know I love you so
