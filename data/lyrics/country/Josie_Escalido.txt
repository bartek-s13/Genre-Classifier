Josie Escalido
She lived south of the border
In a church her granddaddy's daddy built
A little Catholic mission
Where she spent her days wishing
That he would come along and she'd be saved
Jimmy was an outlaw
An outcast from the bad lands
He rode a horse as black as his heart
Stayed hopped up on mezcal
Chased whiskey with saloon gals
But he never could get Josie off his mind
He said meet me after midnight
I'll be riding hot and fast
And our love is like a slow dance
I'm just trying to make it last
And I'm laying down my six guns
And surrendering my heart
It'll be rosary and sangria
Tequila and the cross
Outlaws, angels and the lost
Jimmy married Josie
In that little mountain chapel
He made a vow to Josie and the God
He'd turn from his wicked ways
And leave behind his outlaw days
And pray for forgiveness from his sins
But the past is like a storm
That crashes in from the north
Rode south with the posse set on death
Blood all over Jimmy's hands and
Josie lying in the desert sand
With a bullet that tore Jimmy's heart in two
And he screamed meet me after midnight
I'll be riding hot and fast
And our love is like a slow dance
I'm just trying to make it last
And I'm laying down my six guns
And surrendering my heart
It'll be rosary and sangria
Tequila and the cross
Outlaws, angels and the lost
When you're searching for the devil
Turns out he's not hard to find
He rides a horse as black as his heart
Hell and fire with two six gun
A black horse on a dead end run
When he rode into the rangers camp at dawn
Jimmy buried Josie
In the ashes of that chapel
Left the rangers lying in the sun
Rode out toward the bad lands
And maybe God will understand
That sometimes even angels will get lost
He cried meet me after midnight
I'll be riding hot and fast
And our love is like a slow dance
I'm just trying to make it last
And I'm laying down my six guns
And surrendering my heart
It'll be rosary and sangria
Tequila and the cross
Outlaws, angels and the lost
