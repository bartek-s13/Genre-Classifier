You know that girl who walks into any room
And lights it up, that's what she does, baby, that's you
With all that beautiful wrapped around your smile and
You're 'bout as perfect as your timing

Even when the thunder's rolling
And that clear blue sky's been stolen
You break through like Heaven shining
Always be my silver lining
Glass half full, I try to be
But when it ain't, you're there for me
Bringing sunshine out of hiding
Always be my silver lining

You are my lighthouse, you are my way home
No, I ain't never giving up 'cause you're my stay-strong
Light me up, light me up like you do
Fall into me, fall into you
There ain't no thing we can't get through

Even when the thunder's rolling
And that clear blue sky's been stolen
You break through like Heaven shining
Always be my silver lining
Glass half full, I try to be
But when it ain't, you're there for me
Bringing sunshine out of hiding
Always be my silver lining

Light me up, light me up like you do
Fall into me, fall into you
There ain't no thing we can't get
There ain't no thing we can't get through

Even when the thunder's rolling
And that clear blue sky's been stolen
You break through like Heaven shining
Always be my silver lining
Glass half full, I try to be
But when it ain't, you're there for me
Bringing sunshine out of hiding
Always be my silver lining

My, my, my silver
My, my, my silver
My, my, my silver lining, lining
My, my, my silver
My, my, my silver
My, my, my silver lining, lining
My, my, my silver
My, my, my silver
My, my, my silver lining, lining
