She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, "Don't mind, but what do you mean
I am the one that'll dance on the floor in the round"
She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one Who will dance on the floor in the round
Yeah people always told me, "Be careful of what you do
Don't run around breaking young girls' hearts," oooh
Mama always told me, "Be careful who you love
And be careful what you do
'Cause a lie becomes the truth," yeah
Billie Jean is not my lover, no
She's just a girl that claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son
For forty days and for forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
She told my baby, "We'd danced 'til three."
Then she looked at me
She showed a photo, my baby cried
His eyes looked like mine, yeah
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
And people always told me, "Be careful of what you do
Don't run around breaking young girls' hearts."
Mama always told me, "Be careful who you love
And be careful what you do
'Cause a lie becomes the truth," yeah
Billie Jean is not my lover, no
She's just a girl that claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
No he is not my son, no, no
Mama always told me, "Be careful who you love
And be careful what you do
'Cause a lie becomes the truth," yeah
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl that claims that I am the one
Yeah, the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son
