'Call me in the morning,’ is what they usually say
But she don't wanna hear your voice
Don't wanna know your name
She ain’t gonna lie, she don't want you stay
And unlike other girls, she'll do it all for free
Walking backwards, with a bitter taste
Feeling forward, feeling out of place
Like a child's map, turned into a maze
This ain't wonderland, that she's gotta face
Care in the world like a pocket full of grease
Hand now black like her heart that you can't see
She'll look your way, look you in the eye
Change in the air and now your hands are tied
‘Call me in the morning,’ is what they usually say
But she don’t wanna hear your voice
Don't wanna know your name
She ain’t gonna lie, she don't want you stay
And unlike other girls, she'll do it all for free
A list of things, written in black and white
You'll never understand the grey in which she writes
She looks in the mirror, fix herself into place
Black in her eyes a smile on her face
‘Call me in the morning,’ is what they usually say
But she don't wanna hear your voice
Don't wanna know your name
She ain't gonna lie, she don't want you stay
And unlike other girls, she'll do it all for free
