She’s as free as blue bonnets in the summer
She’s as hot as the Padre Island sun
Most of the time she’s as warm and friendly
Like the hills that surround Austin

She’s as bright as the Dallas sky
She always holds her head up high
She loves the company of her family
She has faith in God’s greater plan
She trusts I’m a good man
And that’s why I’ll always believe
She’s like Texas, and she likes me
Her eyes are green like the trees in Nacogdoches
Her teeth are white as cotton in the fall
And when she laughs you’ll always take notice
'Cause her heart’s charm will shine right through it all

Her moods can change like the weather out in Lubbock
But if you show her love, man, she’ll return it

Oh, she's like Texas and she likes me
