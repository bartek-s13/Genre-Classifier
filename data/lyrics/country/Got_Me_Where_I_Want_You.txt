I hold my breath
You light me up
We’ve both been here before
Your fingerprints
All over me
My back against the door

You only want me when you got me where you want me
Where I can’t say no to that look in your eyes
You only want me when you got me where you want me
And you got me where I want you tonight

You’re a storm
Not the kind you run from
The kind that I chase down
So tonight (Tonight)
Your lips will be my whiskey
Where I can’t help but drown

You only want me when you got me where you want me
Where I can’t say no to that look in your eyes
You only want me when you got me where you want me
And you got me where I want you tonight
I hate the way I want you
And I want you all the time
I hate that I’m not stronger
But, baby you don’t mind
No, you don’t mind

You only want me when you got me where you want me
Where I can’t say no to that look in your eyes
You only want me when you got me where you want me
And you got me where I want you tonight
You got me where I want you tonight
(You got me where I want you)
You got me where I want you
(Got me where I want you)
