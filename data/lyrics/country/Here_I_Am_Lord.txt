I, the Lord of sea and skyy
I have heard my people cry
All who dwell in dark and sin
My hand will save
I who made the starts of might
I will make their darkness bright
Who will bear my light to them?
Whom shall i send?
Here i am Lord, Is it. Lord?
I have heard you calling in the night
I will go Lord, if you lead me
I will hold your people in my heart
I, the Lord of snow and rain
I have borne my peple´s pain
I have wept for love of them, they turn away i will breal this hears of stone
Give them hearts for love alone
I will speak My word to
Whom shall I send?
Here I am Lord, Is it I, Lord?
I have heard You calling in the night
I will go Lord, if You lead me
I will hold Your people in my heart
I, the Lord of wind and flame
I will tend the poor and lame
I will set a feast for them
My hand will save
Finest bread I will provide
Till their hearts be satisfied
I will give My life to them
Whom shall I send
Here I am Lord, Is it I, Lord?
I have heard You calling in the night
I will go Lord, if You lead me
I will hold Your people in my heart
