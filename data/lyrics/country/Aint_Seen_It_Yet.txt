Round here we get high on that cascade blue
Start throwin’ em back when there ain’t much to do
Everybody round here knows my last name
Yeah it’s written on the road sign and written on the gate
Right around 6 there’s a red sunset
If there’s anything better man I ain’t seen it yet
Woah oh
Everybody needs a place that they know and they call home
Keep my boots in the dirt ‘til my name’s in the stone
Cos this kinda good is as good as it gets
If theres anything better well I ain’t seen it yet
Grandaddy’s 68 ford’s still sitting in the shed
Didn’t out run the rust but it’ll out run the wind
Met a pretty from the city brought her out to the farm
Put a ring on her finger and her name on my arm
Got a love burns slow like a lit cigarette
If there’s anything better man I ain’t seen it yet
Woah oh
Everybody needs a place that they know and they call home
Keep my boots in the dirt ‘til my name’s in the stone
Cos this kinda good is as good as it gets
If theres anything better well I ain’t seen it yet
No I ain’t, no I ain’t seen it yet
No I ain’t, no I ain’t seen it yet
Round here we get high on that cascade blue
Keep getting back up and keep pushing on through
Woah oh
Everybody needs a place that they know and they call home
Keep my boots in the dirt ‘til my name’s in the stone
Cos this kinda good is as good as it gets
If theres anything better well I ain’t seen it yet
If theres anything better I ain’t seen it yet
No I ain’t seen it yet
