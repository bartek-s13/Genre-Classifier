I have seen, my last tomorrow
I am holding, my last breath
Goodbye, sweet world of sorrow
My new life, begins with death

I am standing on the mountain
I can hear the angels' song
I am reaching over Jordon
Take my hand, Lord, lead me home

All my burdens are behind me
I have prayed, my final prayer
Don't you cry, over my body
'Cause that ain't me, lyin' there, naw

I am standing on the mountain
I can hear the angels' song
I am reaching over Jordon
Take my hand (Take my hand), Lord, lead me home
I am standing (I am standing) on the mountain (On the mountain)
I can hear the angels' song (I can hear the angels' song)
I am reaching, over Jordon (Over Jordon)
Take my hand, Lord, lead me home (Lead me home)
Take my hand, Lord, lead me home
