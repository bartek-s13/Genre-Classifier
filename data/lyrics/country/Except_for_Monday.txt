You look surprised, you didn't think you'd see me
Kickin' up my heels, paintin' up this town
When you said goodbye
I learned a couple new dances
Cast a couple of glances, I'm on a big roll now
Chorus:
Except for Monday, which was never good anyway
Tuesday, I get a little sideways
Wednesday, I feel better, just for spite
Thursday and Friday take too long
Before I know it, Saturday's gone
But it's Sunday now
And you can bet that I'm alright
Instrumental
Don't get me wrong, it wasn't always this easy
Gettin' over you, got a little rough on me
It didn't take too long, 'til I got it together
And everyday I thank my lucky stars
You set me free
Except for Monday, which was never good anyway
Tuesday, I get a little sideways
Wednesday, I feel better, just for spite
Thursday and Friday take too long
Before I know it, Saturday's gone
But it's Sunday now
And you can bet that I'm alright
Instrumental
Repeat Chorus
It's Sunday now and everything's alright
