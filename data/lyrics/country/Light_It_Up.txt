Theres a dirt road out where the blacktop ends
Down past where the river bends
Turn left when you see the barn
Thats eddie's farm
Theres beer kegs and F-150's
Country girls lookin' pretty
Good old boys gettin good and loud
Its a rowdy crowd
But it ain't a party
We ain't set the scene
Big joe walks over to the brush pile
With a can of kerosene
And we light it up
Tailgates down as a little brown jug
We're passing around
Fillin' little red cups
Its powerful stuff
Out in the sticks
We ain't shy
Gonna set it off like the fourth of july
All week long's still a slow fuse burnin
But tonight were gonna light it up
Till friday we're slazed to the same old grime
But today we can all unwind
Hey, everybody's feelin' fine
In the firelight
Theres a red head lookin pretty smokin'
Hot in a red and white poka dot dress
Man she sure looks fun
Oh, here she comes!
Lord i'd love to have her
Teach me a thing or two
That girl shes a little firecracker
How bout me and you
Light it up
Tailgates down as a little brown jug
Were passing around
Fillin' litle red cups
Its powerful stuff
Out in the sticks
We ain't shy
Gonna set it off like the fourth of july
All week long's been a slow fuse burnin
But tonight were gonna light it up
Light it up
Tailgates down
As a little brown jug
We're passing around
Fillin' litle red cups
Its powerful stuff
Out in the sticks
We ain't shy
Gonna set it off like the fourth of july
All week long's been a slow fuse burnin
But tonight were gonna light it up
Yeah we gonna light it up
Its like a slow fuse burnin
Oh light it up
(oh-oh-oh)
