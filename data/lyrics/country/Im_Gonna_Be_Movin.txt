This old world is no place for livin'
Not enough care, not enough givin'
Sometime clouds of sin and sorrow hide the way
But this life of stormy weather
Ain't gonna be my home forever
Gonna be movin' - one of these days
I'm gonna be movin' - movin' away
Gonna be movin' - one of these days
When I leave this life behind me
Troubles and cares are never gonna find me
Gonna be movin' - one of these days
There won't be any time for cryin'
No more sickness, toil or dyin
Joy awaits me in that mansion far away
When I rest from all my labor
The Lord's gonna be my next door neighbor
Gonna be movin' - one of these days
I'm gonna be movin' - movin' away
Gonna be movin' - one of these days
When I leave this life behind me
Troubles and cares are never gonna find me
Gonna be movin' - one of these days
