Our Father who art in Heaven hallowed be thy name
It was take a knee boys, helmets off before every game
We fought and bled and left it all on that painted piece of ground
We did it for the glory, we did it for the love, and we did it for that town
Jesus was our salvation, all the pretty girls were our temptation
Bringing home State was the expectation , coach put on us all
It was Church by ten, tryna get to heaven
Scared of her daddy get her home by eleven
Cleats hit the field, Friday night at seven as summer turned to fall
Man I miss when life was God, girls, and football
Win or lose we’d always cruise to the same old parking lot
It was drinkin’ ‘neath the moonlight, watchin’ out for blue lights, prayin’ we didn’t get caught
And the only thing runnin’ through our head was seein’ how far we could get
With that hometown honey we were with
Yeah somethinn' that sweet, you don’t forget
Jesus was our salvation, all the pretty girls were our temptation
Bringing home State was the expectation , coach put on us all
It was Church by ten, tryna get to heaven
Scared of her daddy get her home by eleven
Cleats hit the field, Friday night at seven as summer turned to fall
Man I miss when life was God, girls, and football
Church house pew
Back seat view
Third-and-two
Jesus was our salvation, all the pretty girls were our temptation
Bringing home State was the expectation , coach put on us all
It was Church by ten, tryna get to heaven
Scared of her daddy get her home by eleven
Cleats hit the field, Friday night at seven as summer turned to fall
Man I miss when life was God, girls, and football
Just God, girls, and football
