We just hit it off and got so much in common
Like we're onto something good
There's just one problem
Our drinks hit the bottom way sooner than they should
I could get another cold beer, you another rosé
We could keep it low key, okay
But that vibe that I'm getting from you
Says our go-to just won’t do

I bet whiskey would
Start it off good
Swaying in your seat, take it out on the floor
And gypsy dance, heels in your hand
Rocking with the band 'til three in the morning
Need something that'll get this night going down like it should
Kick this thing off right
And I bet whiskey would

Well, this bar's like a circus
But I bet we'll get VIP service
With you looking that way
We could do it Lynchburg, we could do it well
Take a little tour of the top shelf
Get it going
Get it on the rocks and get it rolling

I bet whiskey would
Start it off good
Swaying in your seat, take it out on the floor
And gypsy dance, heels in your hand
Rocking with the band 'til three in the morning
Need something that'll get this night going down like it should
Kick this thing off right
I bet whiskey would
I bet whiskey would

I could get another cold beer, you another rosé
We could keep it low key, okay
But that vibe that I'm getting from you
Says our go-to just won’t do

But I bet whiskey would
Start it off good
Swaying in your seat, take it out on the floor
And gypsy dance, heels in your hand
Rocking with the band 'til three in the morning
Need something that'll get this night going down like it should
Kick this thing off right
And I bet whiskey would
I bet whiskey would
Yeah, I bet whiskey would, ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
