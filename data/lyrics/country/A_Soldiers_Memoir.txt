I've been home about six months now
And I still have my doubts
I'm not sure how I got here
Or how I'm gonna get out
My mama says I look the same
As I did before I left
But if she could see inside of me
It would, scare her to death

I can still taste the powder, from the barrel of my gun
And I can hear my sergeant screamin' "Run soldier run"
I can feel the backpack on my shoulder, God it weighted a ton
And I can see death in every single thought
They taught me how to put that uniform on
But I just can't get it off

Last Saturday they honored us
In a small parade downtown
And when they set off those fireworks
I nearly hit the ground
While they smiled and cheered for us
All I could do was stare
Cause half of me is here at home
And half of me is back there
I can still taste the powder, from the barrel of my gun
And I can hear my sergeant screamin' "Run soldier run"
I can feel the backpack on my shoulder, God it weighted a ton
And I can see death in every single thought
They taught me how to put that uniform on
But I just can't get it off

Yeah there's no end in sight
Cause' even though I'm home now
I'm still fighting for my life

I can still taste the powder, from the barrel of my gun
And I can hear my sergeant screamin' "Run soldier run"
I can feel the backpack on my shoulder, God it weighted a ton
And I can see death in every single thought
They taught me how to put that uniform on
But I just can't get it off
