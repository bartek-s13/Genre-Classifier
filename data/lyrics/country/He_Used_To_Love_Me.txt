I had me a good one but he got away
I tend to always send him into shock
You should have seen his little cutey face
When I said hey babe lets get married and run off
Well I was waiting for him to kiss me
Instead he kissed the wind and left me lying in the dust
Well I'mm gonna get in my car and track him down
I know he didn't mean it when he said see you around
He may be scared and a wee bit shy
But I'm not worried I know he's mine oh mine
Ooo Ooo
I'm gonna bring him back today honey (back one day)
Ooo Ooo
Cause I know he used to love me, yeah
He could be anywhere maybe his mother's place
I think I may just have to swing on by
The last time I showed up well she turned me away
With that devil why you here look in her eye
I bet I'll find him running out the back door
It's OK he's a bust man and I'll catch him soon enough
I'm gonna get in my car and track him down
I know he didn't mean it when he said see you around
He may be scared and a wee bit shy
But I'm not worried I know he's mine oh mine
Ooo Ooo
I'm gonna bring him back today honey (back one day)
Ooo Ooo
Cause I know he used to love me, yeah
Everytime he sees me, he says he doesn't need me
He tells me I'm not the one
No matter where he goes I think he probably knows he will never get too far
I'm gonna get in my car and track him down
I know he didn't mean it when he said see you around
He may be scared and a wee bit shy
But I'm not worried I know he's mine
Oh mine
I'm gonna bring him back today honey
Ooo Ooo
Cause I know he used to love me
He used to love me, he used to love me
Oh yeah (he used to love me, he used to love me)
Oo he used to love me
