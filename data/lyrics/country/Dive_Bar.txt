I've heard it said that opposites attract
Well her and me well we can vouch for that
People look at her and wonder what the hell she's thinking
People look at me and say she's so out of league man
She's high heels and a Cadillac
I'm an old pair of boots and a truck out back
She's champagne and caviar
I'm a beer in a dive bar
She likes the warm glow of a candlelight
I like the dim slow flicker of a neon sign
She's uptown, five star
And me I'm a dive bar
She don't make me drink her fancy wine
And I don't ever ask her if she's down to cast a line
But if it makes her happy I'll dress up and get my swing going
And she knows I go country crazy when she gets her hang on
She's high heels and a Cadillac
I'm an old pair of boots and a truck out back
She's champagne and caviar
I'm a beer in a dive bar
She likes the warm glow of a candlelight
I like the dim slow flicker of a neon sign
She's uptown, five star
And me I'm a dive bar
Like a John Deer rolling through the city (Woo!)
Like Conway rapping P. Diddy (That's right)
I'm a southern drawl, an overhaul
She's silver screen magazine pretty
Well she's high heels and a Cadillac
I'm an old pair of boots and a truck out back
She's champagne and caviar
I'm a beer in a dive bar
She likes the warm glow of a candlelight
I like the dim slow flicker of a neon sign
She's uptown, five star
And me I'm a dive bar
Yeah me I'm a dive bar
