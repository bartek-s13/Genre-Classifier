There's a lot of ways of saying
What I want to say to you
There's songs and poems and promises
And dreams that might come true

But I won't talk of starry skies
Or moonlight on the ground
I'll come right out and tell you
I'd just love to lay you down

Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things a woman loves to hear
I'll let you know how much it means just having you around
Oh darling how I'd love to lay you down

There's so many ways your sweet love's
Made this house into a home
You've got a way of doing
Little things that turn me on

Like standing in the kitchen
In your faded cotton gown
With your hair all up in curlers
I still love to lay you down

Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things a woman loves to hear
I'll let you know how much it means just having you around
Oh darling how I love to lay you down

When a whole lot of Decembers
Are showing in your face
Your auburn hair has faded
And silver takes it's place

You'll be just as lovely
And I'll still be around
And if I can I know that
I'd still love to lay you down

Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things a woman loves to hear
I'll let you know how much it means just having you around
Oh darling how I love to lay you down

Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things my woman loves to hear
I'll let you know how much it means just having you around
Oh darling how I love to lay you down

Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear
Lay you down and tell you all the things my woman loves to hear
I'll let you know how much it means just having you around
Oh darling how I love to lay you down
