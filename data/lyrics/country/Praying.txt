They were prayin’
Prayin’ for someone like me
Not long ago, I was thinkin’ of home
And I wondered if Mama was there all alone
I thought I'd drop by, as I had before
But the sound from within made me stop at the door
She was prayin’, a sound that the world seldom hears
Prayin’ her words were pleading and clear
The sound of her voice, as she spoke my name
Brought tears to my eyes, my heart filled with shame
She was prayin’, prayin’ for someone like me
Walkin’ one night, I felt so alone
My heart was so heavy from the trouble I’ve known
I hadn’t noticed, a church that was near
‘Til the sound from within seem to fill the air
They were prayin’, a sound that the world seldom hears
Prayin’, the children that God loves so dear
Outside in the darkness, I could not see
But I could picture them down on their knees
Prayin’, prayin’ for someone like me
