In the middle of this crowd
Floating on a cloud
Every song that’s playing
Is what I’m feeling right now
I know you wanna kiss me
I feel a little tipsy from the lights and the shine and you’re spinning me around
I got the best seat in the house
It’s better in the back row
Where you and i can dance slow
No I don’t need no front row seat
With my good time right here next to me
Right here on my tip toes
It’s better in the back row
It’s better in the back row
We can barely see the stage
Baby that’s ok, I’d rather watch the way the lights move across your face
We get a little closer; the show ain’t close to over
When the crowd clears out I’m thinking we should stay
Nobody’s watching us anyway
It’s better in the back row
Where you and I can dance slow
No I don’t need no front row seat
With my good time right here next to me
Right here on my tip toes
It’s better in the back row
Everybody’s waving lighters
You and me starting fires
Everybody’s lost in music
I’m lost in you and your kiss
In the back row
It’s better in the back row
It’s better in the back row
Where you and I can dance slow
No I don’t need no front row seat
With my good time right here next to me
Right here on my tip toes
It’s better in the back row
It’s better in the back row
It’s better in the back row
