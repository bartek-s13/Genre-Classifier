You had a Corona, I was drinking Bud Light
That jukebox singing every song just right that night
Something brewing in the air, and it was more than just smoke
Looking back, looking back after two you laughed at all my jokes
Tonight lets raise 'em up to where we ended up

There's been highs and lows, fast lane freeways and bumpy roads
Cursed the devil and prayed to heaven
Lost it all, and we rolled some sevens
There's been some smiles then there's been tears
Been more good than bad years
Ain't it crazy baby how we got here
Oh, it all started with a beer
Oh, it all started with an ice cold beer

I didn't have much money, but I covered them rounds
Cause a pretty girl like you makes a fella throw his money down
You weren’t shooting on whiskey, just shooting the shit
I paid the tab we walked out the door, I remember thinking this was it
Yeah, you were it

There's been highs and lows, fast lane freeways and bumpy roads
Cursed the devil and prayed to heaven
Lost it all, and we rolled some sevens
There's been more smiles than there's been tears
Been more good than bad years
Ain't it crazy baby how we got here
Oh, it all started with a beer
Oh, it all started with an ice cold beer
Here’s to you baby
So tonight lets raise ‘em up to where we ended up

There's been highs and lows, fast lane freeways and bumpy roads
Cursed the devil and prayed to heaven
Lost it all, and we rolled some sevens
There's been more smiles than there's been tears
Been more good than bad years
Ain't it crazy baby how we got here
Oh, it all started with a beer
Oh, it all started with an ice cold beer
Oh, it all started with an ice cold beer
