My life on the road has always been hard on me and you
And every time we say goodbye, it gets harder to do
But when I'm far away somewhere alone and the missin' you starts
All I got to do is picture you and I can feel you in my heart
So dream of me every time you get to feelin' blue
Dream of me and I'll be dreaming of you
I've been a lot of places but there's just no place like home
And I'm always on my way back to you every minute that I'm gone
So when you get to feelin' lonely just remember we won't always be apart
Close your eyes and think of me and you can feel me in your heart
So dream of me every time you get to feelin' blue
Dream of me and I'll be dreaming of you
So dream of me every time you get to feelin' blue
Dream of me and I'll be dreaming of you
