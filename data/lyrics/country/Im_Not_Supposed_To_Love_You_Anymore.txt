We agreed that it was over
Now the lines have all been drawn
The vows we made began to fade
But now they're gone
Put your pictures in a shoebox
And my gold ring in a drawer
I'm not supposed to love you anymore
Now Sherri says she's jealous
Of this freedom that I've found
If she were me she would be
Out on the town
And she says she can't imagine
What on Earth I'm waiting for
I'm not supposed to love you anymore
Chorus:
Oh I shouldn't care or wonder where
And how you are
But I can't hide this hurt inside my
Broken heart
I'm fighting back emotions that I've
Never fought before
'Cause I'm not supposed to love you anymore
Now I'm writing you this letter
And it's killing me tonight
That I agreed when you believed
It wasn't right
And I couldn't sleep up on the bed
So I'm down here on the floor
Where I'm not supposed to love you anymore
Chorus
I'm fighting back emotions that I've
Never fought before
'Cause I'm not supposed to love you anymore
