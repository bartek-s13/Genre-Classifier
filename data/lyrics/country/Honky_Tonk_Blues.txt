I got the blues, the blues I can't lose
I've got them honky tonky blues
I got a honky tonky baby girl
She's got my brain in the whirl
She wears a dress into an age
And when she stands in the breeze
It puts a sneaky feeling in my spine
And when she sits on my knee, it's like a honey bee
Ooh baby mine

I go at night, just to see the sights
When I get home, about daylight
Wife begins to start, I begin to lie
Ooh baby, I got them honky tonk blues

I got the blues, the blues I can't lose
I've got them honky tonky blues
I got a honky tonky baby girl
She's got my brain in the whirl
She wears a dress into an age
And when she stands in the breeze
It puts a sneaky feeling in my spine
And when she sits on my knee, it's like a honey bee
Ooh baby mine
