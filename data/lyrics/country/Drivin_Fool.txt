I pulled over at a little truck stop just outside el Paso Texas one night gonna try to get a cup of coffee n wake up, walked
Inside sat down beside this old truck driver, we started yappin next thing u no were playin cards, he beat the socks off me
Then it came time for us to go.. so we walked outside i headed for my rig he headed for his but just before he climbed up in
That cab i saw him get down on his knee and i heard him say this little prayer
Lord everyday, help me made the grain, help me pull my way down the long highway, keep my coffee hot and may my breaks stay
Cool, lord please take care of this drivin fool, keep my hands steady on the wheel, keep me in control of this chrome and
Steel, my only prayer is lord that you, keep takin care of this drivin fool
In the pourin rain and the hot sunshine, when the blindin snow hides the long white line..if its rough or if its smooth
Lord please take care of this drivin fool
As he drove away,i thought now theres a man living everyday giving all he can, then it dawned on me maybe we should to cause
Ain't we all jus drivin fools
In the pourin rain and the hot sunshine, when the blindin snow hides the long white line..if its rough or if its smooth
Lord please take care of this drivin fool....lord please take care of this drivin fool
