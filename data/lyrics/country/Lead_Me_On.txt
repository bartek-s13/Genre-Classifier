Here I am busted up again
Another wasted love
It was worth it on the road awhile
Hanging on her poison smile
That girl was easy on the eye, but hard on my heart
All the signs said we were wrong, but I let her lead me on

Lead me on sweet baby
You're not a lady
But you knew all the ways to turn me on
Throw me down, leave me thirsty
Spare me your mercy
Just as long as you keep leading me on
Don't want to sing another sad song saying the same old thing
I don't need your sympathy
Don't shed your tears for me
Days when you find me split in two
Save myself or run to you
Just take me by the hand, you can lead me on again

You could leave me lonely
You could leave me crazy
You could leave me barely hanging on
Just as long as you keep leading me on
Lead me on sweet Jesus
She left me in pieces
But she knew all the ways to turn me on
Throw me down leave me thirsty till I'm begging for mercy
Just as long as you keep leading me on
Just as long as you keep leading me on
