Moonlit night
There's no need for headlights
This beat up truck could damn near drive itself
You're trying hard not to show it
But we both know where this is goin
And if somehow tonight I still can't tell you how I feel
I'll give you a ring
So your eyes won't tell me no
Your reaction won't bring out my insecurity
Wanna give you a ring
Tell you how i feel
Might make more sense on a telephone line than right here beside you
I'll give you a ring
Well your daddy raised you right
When he tucked you in at night
Told you never go around kissin ole boys like me
Well lets look past our mistakes
Its a chance we gotta take
Oh now let these walls around our hearts come crumblin to our feet
I'll give you a ring
So your eyes won't tell me no
Your reaction won't bring out my insecurity
I'm gonna give you a ring
Tell you how i feel
Might make more sense on a telephone line than right here beside you
I'll give you a ring
You're still with me
We made some memories
Open up to me down here on my knee
I'll give you a ring
I hope your eyes won't tell me no
Your reaction won't bring out my insecurity
Im gonna give you a ring
Show you how i feel
Always and forever is just what I mean
I'll give you a ring
