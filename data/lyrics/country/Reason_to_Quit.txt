I still leave the light on for her side of the bed
'Cause I know she was scared of the dark
And I still play that voicemail just to hear her sweet voice sayin'
"Honey, come on home, you work too hard?

I know you think it's been a while and I should just move on
But God knows there's a part of me feels better if I don't

I was smokin' like a chimney
They said that it would kill me
So I gave in and quit them cigarettes
Now they say that it ain't healthy
Dwellin' on her memory
But I know it ain't hurtin' me a bit
So I ain't got a reason to quit
No I ain't got a reason to quit

I don't need no doctor to tell me it's depression
Or give me some pill to feel alright
I just thing about them pictures of her making funny faces
In a crowded room, I laughed so hard I cried

From the outside it might look like I've lost my mind
But this is just my way of keeping her alive

I was smokin' like a chimney
They said that it would kill me
So I gave in and quit them cigarettes
Now they say that it ain't healthy
Dwellin' on her memory
But I know it ain't hurtin' me a bit
So I ain't got a reason to quit
No I ain't got a reason to quit

I was smokin' like a chimney
They said that it would kill me
So I gave in and quit them cigarettes
Now they say that it ain't healthy
Dwellin' on her memory
But I know it ain't hurtin' me a bit
So I don't see a reason to quit
No I ain't got a reason to quit

I still leave the light on for her side of the bed
'Cause I know she was scared of the dark
