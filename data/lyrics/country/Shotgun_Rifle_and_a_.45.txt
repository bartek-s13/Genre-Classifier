This old countries going crazy
When will we wake up and see
Will we watch over our freedom
Will we just watch more tv
'Cause we keep flipping these stations
But we forgotten what this nations founded on
We gotta stand up for our rights
Before we know it we turn around and they’re gone

I got a shotgun rifle and a 45
With a whip solid tips and banana clips
I got a shotgun rifle and a 45
I got a shotgun rifle and a 45
I got rounds and rounds in case it all goes bad
I got a shotgun rifle and a 45
They can’t take that away

Can you believe what we’ve become
Did we forget where we come from
These people want to take our guns
Well if they’re coming I say let em come
I got the Bill of Rights hanging in my kitchen
And Sam Crow paint by the soldiers with the flesh and ball
We got to stand up for our rights before we know it
We turn around and they’ll be gone

I got a shotgun rifle and a 45
With a whip solid tips and banana clips
I got a shotgun rifle and a 45
I got a shotgun rifle and a 45
I got rounds and rounds in case it all goes bad
I got a shotgun rifle and a 45
They can’t take that away

Wake up and smell the roses yeah
What’s really going on
We’re fighting for our freedom
And it’s happen all at once
Lord only knows what they got cooking
But Lord knows our souls ain’t nothing but they’re stepping stones
If we don’t stand up for our rights before we know it
We turn around and they’ll be gone

I got a shotgun rifle and a 45

I got a shotgun rifle and a 45
