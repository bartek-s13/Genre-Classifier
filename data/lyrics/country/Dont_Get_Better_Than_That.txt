Ever caught a buzz floating down the river
Ever looked in the her eyes and seen forever
Ever smelled the air right after the rain
Ever come back home just for Momma's cooking
Ever hit that shot when everybody's looking
Ever felt that rush from a leap of faith
Yeah it don't get better than

Rolling with a full tank, wasting gas
Sipping on a sunset, crushing cans
A little Nitty Gritty turned up full blast
It don't get better than that
Raise a lot of hell on a Friday night
Holding on your honey under neon lights
Knowing where you've been, loving where you're at
It don't get better than that

Ever heard the words "I love you, Daddy"
Felt the waves touch your toes off the coast of Cali
Lost count counting stars 'cause there's just so many in the sky
Don't they look good tonight

Rolling with a full tank, wasting gas
Sipping on a sunset, crushing cans
A little Nitty Gritty turned up full blast
It don't get better than that
Raise a lot of hell on a Friday night
Holding on your honey under neon lights
Knowing where you've been, loving where you're at
It don't get better than that
Ever found the truth on a Sunday morning
Ever go all in when you're free falling
Felt like you're right where you're meant to be
Like you and me

Rolling with a full tank, wasting gas
Sipping on a sunset, crushing cans
A little Nitty Gritty turned up full blast
It don't get better than that
Raise a lot of hell on a Friday night
Holding on your honey under neon lights
Knowing where you've been, loving where you're at
It don't get better than that

It don't get better, it don't get better than that
