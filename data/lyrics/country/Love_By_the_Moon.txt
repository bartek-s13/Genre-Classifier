'Round here we got our hands in the dirt all week
'Round here it's a summer time dip in the creek
'Round here we get high on the air we breathe
Raise 'em up if you know what I mean
Live by the sun, love by the moon
Pick up your girl when the workin's through
Light up the night 'til the sky turns blue
Live by the sun, love by the moon
Out here every road runs right off the map
Out here she likes the seats layin' way on back
Out here we count the stars 'til we can't keep track
Ain't got a doubt in good like that
Live by the sun, love by the moon
Pick up your girl when the workin's through
Light up the night 'til the sky turns blue
Live by the sun, love by the moon
We keep it simple yeah, right down the middle lane
Hell it's just what we do
Live by the sun, love by the moon
Pick up your girl 'cause she's waitin' on you
Light up the night 'til the sky turns blue
Live by the sun, yeah
Live by the sun, love by the moon
Pick up your girl when the workin's through
Light up the night 'til the sky turns blue
Live by the sun, love by the moon
Love by the moon, oh yeah
Love by the moon, yeah yeah
'Round here we got our hands in the dirt all week
'Round here it's a summer time dip in the creek
