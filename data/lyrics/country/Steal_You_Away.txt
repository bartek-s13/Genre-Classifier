I can see you standing with him
He ain't holding your hand like he should
He ain't listening to a word you say
He doesnt look at you the way i would
I should steal you away
Ive been wondering are you looking at me
Thinking how it might be if you were mine
Girl it drives me crazy
He dont know what hes got
Im fighting so hard not to cross the line
I should steal you away i should steal you away
In the middle of the night come take your heart
I should steal you away
I could see us walking out that door
Not looking back as we roll down the road
And i would show you what a mans supposed to be
Take you anywhere you ever wanna go
I should steal you away i should steal you away
In the middle of the night come take your heart
I should steal you away i should steal you away
