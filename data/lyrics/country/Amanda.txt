I've held it all inward
Lord knows I've tried
It's an awful awakenin'
In a country boy's life
To look in the mirror
In total surprise
At the hair on your shoulders
And the age in your eyes
(Chorus)
Amanda light of my life
Fate should have made you a gentle man's wife
Amanda light of my life
Fate should have made you a gentle man's wife
Well the measure of people
Don't understand
The pleasures of life
In a hillbilly band
I got my first guitar
When I was fourteen
Now I'm crowding thirty
And still wearin' jeans
(Chorus)
