On the cross of Calvary our blessed Saviour died
Gave His life to save the world from loss;
In His pain and agony, for every sin to hide
Shed the blood that stained the old rugged cross

'Twas His blood, His precious blood that stained the old rugged cross
'Twas His love that paid the awful cost;
Oh soul so far astray come and plunge today
In the blood that stained the old rugged cross

To the cross, the rugged cross they nailed His precious hands
And in death He fully paid the cost
There is pardon in His love for everyone that stands
For the blood that stained the old rugged cross

What an awful death He died to pardon you and me
All alone in agony He tossed
And a world once lost in sin can now be wholly free
By the blood that stained the old rugged cross
