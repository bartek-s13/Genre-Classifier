Well I drove all night to get here
I'm not sure why I came
On a California Sunday mornin'
Outside it looks like rain
Oh and up and down the boulevard
Lights change from green to red
As I shuffle on down that sidewalk
I'm just tryin' to ease my head
I've got these Sacramento blues
15 dollars to my name
I'm just a drifter from central Texas
With a pair of ramblin' shoes to blame
Oh, these ramblin' shoes to blame
Well I came here from Willow City
With one thing on my mind
It ain't something I've been runnin' from
Or tryin' to leave behind
I was born to keep movin'
So thats just what I do
But I fear I can't outrun
Sacramento blues
Lord I fear I can't outrun these Sacramento blues
I've got these Sacramento blues
15 dollars to my name
I'm just a drifter from central Texas
With a pair of ramblin' shoes to blame
Ramblin' shoes to blame
