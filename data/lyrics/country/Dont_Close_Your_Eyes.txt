I know you loved him a long time ago
And even now in my arms you still want him I know
But, Darling, this time let your memories die
When you hold me tonight, don't close your eyes

Don't close your eyes, let it be me
Don't pretend it's him in some fantasy
Darling, just once let yesterday go
And you'll find more love than you've ever known
Just hold me tight when you love me tonight
And don't close your eyes

Maybe I've been a fool, holding on all this time
Lying here in your arms, knowing he's in your mind
But I keep hoping some day that you'll see the light
Let it be me tonight, don't close your eyes

Don't close your eyes, let it be me
Don't pretend it's him in some fantasy
Darling, just once let yesterday go
And you'll find more love than you've ever known
Just hold me tight when you love me tonight
And don't close your eyes
Don't close your eyes, let it be me
Don't pretend it's him in some fantasy
Darling, just once let yesterday go
And you'll find more love than you've ever known
Just hold me tight when you love me tonight
And don't close your eyes

Just hold me tight when you love me tonight
And don't close your eyes
