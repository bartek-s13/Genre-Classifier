Roly Poly, eatin' corn and taters
Hungry every minute of the day
Roly poly, gnawin' on a bisquit
Long as he can chew it it's ok
He can eat an aple pie
And never bat an eye
He likes everything from soup to hay
Roly Poly, daddy's little fatty
Bet he's gonna be a man someday
Roly Poly, scrambled eggs for breakfast
Bread and jelly 20 times a day
Roly Poly, eats a hearty dinner
It takes lots of strength to run and play
Pulls up weeds and does the chores
Runs both ways to all the stores
He works up an appitite that way
Roly Poly, daddy's little fatty
Bet he's gonna be a man someday
