He'll believe that Jesus saves
He’ll always love the Braves
He's gonna go through that phase where he thinks he knows it all
Gonna eat, sleep, and breathe in boots
Probably never gonna own a suit
Drop everything he's ’bout to do any time his mama calls

That's my boy
He's a blue chip straight off the blocker
Jacked up old truck, Kenwood rocker
Fist sized dent in a football locker
Fired up and making noise
He's a get back up from a life hand maker
Got your back now, you can get me back later
I can hear me now in my bleacher, proud southern boys
"Yeah, that's my boy"

Gonna break some hearts and break some bones
Gonna break out on his own
Find a rear view and get back home just as fast as he can
Like his old man

That's my boy
He's a blue chip straight off the blocker
Jacked up old truck, Kenwood rocker
Fist sized dent in a football locker
Fired up and making noise
He's a get back up from a life hand maker
Got your back now, you can get me back later
I can hear me now in my bleacher, proud southern boys
"Yeah, that’s my boy"
That’s my heart
That's my soul
That’s my last name
That's a love like I've never known, yeah, that's my boy

Yeah, that’s my boy
He's a blue chip straight off the blocker
Jacked up old truck, Kenwood rocker
Fist sized dent in a football locker
Fired up and making noise
He's a get back up from a life hand maker
Got your back now, you can get me back later
I can hear me now in my bleacher, proud southern boys
"Yeah, that's my boy"

Yeah, that's my boy
That's my boy
