It’s always when the street lights are blinking red
It’s only when you’re the only thing in my head
I don’t know how you know but you know when I’m too far gone
It’s always right when I wanna do something wrong

I hate when you call but I answer again
Cause you don’t give a damn that it’s 2 am
‘Tween the baby I need you, I wanna be closer
The truth in the morning, the moment it’s over
It’s the moonlight and the rattle of you knocking on the door
I wind up breaking out a bottle, then it’s cotton on the floor
It’s the drinking, it’s the touching, it’s the lying, it’s the sting
It kills me when you leave, I hate how it starts, I hate how it ends
But I love everything, everything, everything in between

I’m always just a place where you can crash
All you leave is your lipstick on a glass
Yeah the middle of the night is never enough
But it’s enough to keep me hanging on
So I play along as long as you let me

I hate when you call but I answer again
Cause you don’t give a damn that it’s 2 am
‘Tween the baby I need you, I wanna be closer
The truth in the morning, the moment it’s over
It’s the moonlight and the rattle of you knocking on the door
I wind up breaking out a bottle, then it’s cotton on the floor
It’s the drinking, it’s the touching, it’s the lying, it’s the sting
It kills me when you leave, I hate how it starts, I hate how it ends
But I love everything, everything, everything in between

Yeah it’s the moonlight and the rattle of you knocking on the door
I wind up breaking out a bottle, then it’s cotton on the floor
It’s the drinking, it’s the touching, it’s the lying, it’s the sting
It kills me when you leave, I hate how it starts, I hate how it ends
But I love everything, everything in between
