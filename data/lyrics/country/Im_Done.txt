Well you don't know that I know
I plan to keep it that way for as long as I can
Time the truth comes out and
Your conscience has done eatin' away
I hope he makes you happy
Like I tried to do for so long
Baby just let it all out
Like I'm about to do in this song
'Cause I'm done
And I can't do it anymore despite how hard I try
Baby I'm done livin' with these chances I've givin' to you
Yeah I'm done
Well now I can run free
It feels so good to know you're not runnin' around on me
Keep your eyes wide open 'cause karma's a bitch and I heard she's not jokin'
I'm done
And I can't do it anymore despite how hard I try
Baby I'm done livin' with these chances I've givin' to you
I'm done
I'm done
And I can't do it anymore despite how hard I try
Baby I'm done livin' with these chances I've givin' to you
'Cause I'm done
And I can't do it anymore despite how hard I try
Baby I'm done livin' with these chances I've givin' to you
I'm done
