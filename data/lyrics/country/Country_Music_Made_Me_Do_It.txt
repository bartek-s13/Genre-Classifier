I sit in my bedroom, strumming daddy's LG guitar
Staring out the window at all those country stars
Somehow they led me to a loaded down GMC
Oil checked and all gassed up, headed for Tennessee
No I never could've done it on my own

Country music made me do it
Held my hand and walked me through it
Led the way, kept me strong
It always does when I turn it on
It's always highs and lows, the song
Keeps on pushing me along
I could take the credit but I always knew it
Country music made me do it

I fell for a boy, he talked a real good game
He was Marlboro reds even on the edge
It's sweet when he said my name
Well you live and learn, yeah heartbreak hurts
And it was time for me to leave
But it was hard to find my way out
I was in so deep, yeah but

Country music made me do it
Held my hand and walked me through it
Led the way, kept me strong
It always does when I turn it on
It's always highs and lows, the song
Keeps on pushing me along
I could take the credit but I always knew it
Country music made me do it

I couldn't just say goodbye
I never would've chased this dream
I never left it
And it's never left me

Country music made me do it
Held my hand and walked me through it
Led the way, kept me strong
It always does when I turn it on
It's always highs and lows, the song
That keeps on pushing me along
I could take the credit but I always knew it
Country music made me do it
Country music made me do it
Made me do it
