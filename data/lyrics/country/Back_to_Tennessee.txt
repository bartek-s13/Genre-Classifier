Fancy cars and diamond rings
I seen all kinds of shiny things
I should be feeling like a king
But lord I don't
Great big towns, so full of users
Make a million, still a loser
Some may bet on you to win
Most hope you won't
Living wild, is no mercy being free
When it brings you to your knees
Can't keep lying

I've seen the road now
I know just what I need
To find my way back to Tennessee
I'm going home now
To Southern, is so sweet
And find my way back to Tennessee

I was only seventeen
I lived behind my beauty queen
I turned my back on everything
And everyone
Rooms with lots of pretty faces
Still don't fill the empty spaces
Wandering where Amazing Grace is
There is none, no
Now I know, there's no comfort in this world
God I miss that hometown girl
Want to hold her

All this time I was chasing after dreams
It was right in front of me
I was lost without her
