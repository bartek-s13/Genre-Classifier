Red sky fading, let's do this right
What you're drinking is what I'm drinking
Who's got a light?
We 'bout to burn up this nine to five from dusk till dawn
Man it's on
Blue jean babies in 501s
Music's playing, yeah we're swaying, turn this one up
The stars are falling like confetti, so wish on one
Before they're gone
Find someone, have some fun
Till it all gets lost in the light

Singing long live the night
It's a song coming on, one that everyone knows
It's a bar, it's a field, it's a see where it goes
It's a guy and a girl hoping that sun don't rise
Singing long live the night
All the beers and the years gonna fly on by
We're just small town stars holding on to midnight
So take a sip, this is it, raise 'em on up real high
Singing long live the night

Full moon rising, we ain't there yet
Every minute's a memory so drink it in
Before you know it's over man it flies by fast
Make it last
Take a picture while you kiss her, make a moment
For the rest of your life

Singing long live the night
It's a song coming on, one that everyone knows
It's a bar, it's a field, it's a see where it goes
It's a guy and girl hoping that sun don't rise
Singing long live the night
All the beers and the years gonna fly on by
We're just small town stars holding on to midnight
Take a sip, this is it, raise 'em on up real high
Singing long live the night

Long live the night
Find someone, have some fun
Till it all gets lost in the light

Singing long live the night
It's a song coming on, one that everyone knows
It's a bar, it's a field, it's a see where it goes
It's a guy and girl hoping that sun don't rise
Singing long live the night
All the beers and the years gonna fly on by
We're just small town stars holding on to midnight
Take a sip, this is it, raise 'em on up real high
Singing long live the night

Long live the night
Long live the night
