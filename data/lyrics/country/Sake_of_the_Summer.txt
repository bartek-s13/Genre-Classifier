Your frozen margarita hands
Like ice on sunburned skin
Hurt like hell but felt so good
If I could do it all over again, hey
I would do it all over again
In a heartbeat
'Cause my heart beat out my chest
Every time you kiss me
And we said those empty promises we meant
Like

You be mine and I'll be yours
Three months and everything we're lookin' for
Nobody wants to show up to a party alone, no
We were in and out of love with each other
Told one another
"Let's break to break for the sake of the summer"
We let our heads tell our hearts what they wanted to hear
We let our hearts tell our heads that we were only here
For the sake of the summer
No

Didn't want just anybody
Filling up my shotgun seat
And you didn't wanna be the girl
Dancin' to a lonely beat
So I spun you around and around
And you sat next to me
We agreed

You be mine and I'll be yours
Three months and everything we're lookin' for
Nobody wants to show up to a party alone, no
We were in and out of love with each other
Told one another
"Let's break to break for the sake of the summer"
We let our heads tell our hearts what they wanted to hear
We let our hearts tell our heads that we were only here
For the sake of the summer
No

Yeah, sometimes
Goodbye hurts
Sometimes it doesn't
No
We both knew what it was
And what it wasn't, oh
We let our heads tell our hearts what they wanted to hear
We let our hearts tell our heads

You be mine and I'll be yours
Three months and everything we're lookin' for
Nobody wants to show up to a party alone, no
We were in and out of love
With each other
Told one another
"Let's break to break for the sake of the summer"
No
Yeah, you be mine and I'll be yours
Three months and everything we're lookin' for, no
For the sake of the summer
For the sake of the summer
You be mine and I'll be yours
For the sake of the summer
