Sleep, lay me down, hold me closely in your arms
And I will close my eyes
Please, promise me that when I wake up from my dreams
You`ll be there by my side
Love, if you say you won't slip away
Then I can go dreaming of forever more
But I won't rest until
I know that you`ll be here in the morning by my side
Here in my reach
I can see the one that I've waited for so long
And deep in my heart I`ll know the arms that hold me now
Will hold me from now on
I dread the dawn I awake and find you gone
Please tell me you will stay
Then sleep will come, I know my love has found a home
In your arms all my days
