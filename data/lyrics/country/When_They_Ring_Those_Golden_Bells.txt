(When they ring those golden bells for you and me)
There's a land beyond the river that we call the sweet forever
And we only reach that shore by fate's decree
One by one we'll gain the portals then to dwell with thing immortals
When they ring those golden bells for you and me
Don't you hear the bells now ringing don't you hear the angels singing
This glory hallelujah jubilee
In that far off sweet forever just beyond the shining river
When they ring those golden bells for you and me
When our days shall know the number when in death we'll sweetly slumber
When the king commands the spirit to be free
Never more with anguish laidin' we shall reach that lovely aimin'
When they ring those golden bells for you and me
Don't you hear the bells now ringing...
