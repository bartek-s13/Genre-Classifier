Everybody said we wouldn’t make it baby
Love don’t live around here much lately
Times are hard and hearts break like the bank
Aw yes they do
Lots of reasons just to give it on up
Leave your soul on the shelf collecting dust
Live in a world of broken promises and empty tanks
Aw but look at us

Look at us with a picket fence
Don’t got a lot of money but we’re makin’ a dent
Old Ford truck with a dog in the back
Now, ain’t we livin’ the dream
Big blue sky, green, green grass
Ain’t doing half bad for a half full glass
Kiss me baby, yeah, just like that
Now, ain’t we livin’ the dream?

Put on a little old Keith Whitley
Back porch dancin’ singin’ with me
I’m no stranger to the rain, no, no we ain’t
Pour a little bit of homemade wine
Make some love, take our sweet time
Why the hell do we complain
Look at us with a picket fence
Don’t got a lot of money but we’re makin’ a dent
Old Ford truck with a dog in the back
Now, ain’t we livin’ the dream
Big blue sky, green, green grass
Ain’t doing half bad for a half full glass
Kiss me baby, yeah, just like that
Now, ain’t we livin’ the dream?

Look at us we got a life out here
Outlaws, in-laws, coolers of beer
Spot on the wall to hang last year’s deer
Now, ain’t we livin’ the dream
Red, white and blue flag hangin’
Kids in the back just a tire swingin’
Fireworks booming and banging
Now, ain’t we livin’ the dream?

Look at us with a picket fence
Don’t got a lot of money but we’re makin’ a dent
Old Ford truck with a dog in the back
Now, ain’t we livin’ the dream
Big blue sky, green, green grass
Ain’t doing half bad for a half full glass
Kiss me baby, yeah, just like that
Now, ain’t we livin’ the dream?
Oh, oh, yeah
They say we’d never make it baby
Love don’t live around here much lately
What do you think about that?
