Is it Friday yet? Is the weekend here?
Is it time for me to kick things off with an ice cold beer?
Been working so dang hard that I forget:
Is it Friday yet?
8 o'clock on Monday morning
All I think about is when the day will end
Gotta make a living somehow
That's the way it is for me and all my friends
We watch the hours pass
Every day I ask:
Is it Friday yet? Is the weekend here?
Is it time for me to kick things off with an ice cold beer?
Been working so dang hard that I forget:
Is it Friday yet?
That boss of mine he drives me crazy
Maybe he's just thinkin' 'bout the weekend too
He'd probably love to be invited
Hang out with our rowdy crowd and act a fool
When we're off the clock
We'll pop a top
Is it Friday yet? Is the weekend here?
Is it time for me to kick things off with an ice cold beer?
Been working so dang hard that I forget:
Is it Friday yet?
The days go slow
And I'd like to know
Is it Friday yet? Is the weekend here?
Is it time for me to kick things off with an ice cold beer?
Been working so dang hard that I forget:
