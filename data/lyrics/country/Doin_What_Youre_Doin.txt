If you rolling keep rolling baby don't stop

Ain't nothing wrong with just getting loose
Cold sipping on a little gin and juice
Underneath that setting sun
You can't tear and that ain't fun

You got your country girls all hillbilly shaking
Beer drinking farm boys yelling, "crank it"
It's a red neck block party on a blanket
It's whatever you make it

If you rolling keep rolling baby don't stop
If you living on the edge baby let it rock
If you bumping to a tight slow groove that you found
Turn it on up, spread it all around

Everybody throw your hands up
Tip your drink on back and get another cup
If you wanna keep feeling that feeling let me tell you how
Keep on doing what you're doing now

Sneak another kiss, hook up a little sun
No matter what it is, go on and get you some
Living young, buck wild, getting crazy
It's what I'm talking about baby



Keep on doing what you wanna do
Chasing dreams til they all come true
Don't let nobody slow you down
It takes all kinds to make the world go round, round, round
