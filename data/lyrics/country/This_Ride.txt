Breathe in and take a minute, this moment yeah you’re in it
This ain’t a movie, this is real life
Roll the dice and take a chance now, you never know how this could turn out
Dreams you got hiding deep down inside
It might be just ember, don’t worry just remember
The smallest spark can set the world on fire
Keep on rolling as the days go by
Love somebody bigger than the sky
Just keep making more of those good times
Hold on tight
There’s only one shot on this ride
Don’t it feel good to let go,  throw the bullshit out the window
Put a few more miles out on that highway
Take a trip back to your hometown, if ya gotta get your feet back on the ground
If you get lost, just know it’s ok
Keep on rolling as the days go by
Love somebody bigger than the sky
Just keep making more of those good times
Hold on tight
You only live once
There’s only one shot on this ride
Keep on rolling as the days go by
Love somebody bigger than the sky
Just keep making more of those good times
Hold on tight, hold on tight
Keep on rolling as the days go by
Love somebody bigger than the sky
Just keep making more of those good times
Hold on tight
You only live once
There’s only one shot on this ride
