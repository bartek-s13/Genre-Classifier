She don't laugh at everything
But when she does the planets swing around her
She don't step on sidewalk seams
Teenage boyfriends all still dream about her
She don't need the glitter of the Vegas lights
She could blow a kiss and leave you spinning like a Tilt-A-Whirl

I met a girl, she made me smile
She made me wait, she crossed the street
She crossed my heart, she fixed her dress
She bit her lip, she lit me up
I met a girl, with crazy shoes
And baby blues, the way she moves
Is changin' my whole world
I met a girl

The sunshine waits for her to wake up
She's a ponytail, no makeup, Saturday
'Cause she don't need umbrellas in a summer rain
She could catch the eye of a hurricane in blue jean pearls

I met a girl, she made me smile
She made me wait, she crossed the street
She crossed my heart, she fixed her dress
She bit her lip, she lit me up
I met a girl, with crazy shoes
And baby blues, the way she moves
Is changin' my whole world

She turned around
And it felt like the world turned upside down
And the only thing that I could say was hey
And I'm so glad she didn't walk away
She dances like nobody sees her
Can't believe I get to be here in her world

I met a girl, she made me smile
She made me wait, she crossed the street
She crossed my heart, she fixed her dress
She bit her lip, she lit me up
I met a girl, with crazy shoes
And baby blues, the way she moves
Is changin' my whole world
I met a girl
