I lose my blues
Honey, when I'm with you
No one else can do
You're in my heart to stay
But when I'm gone
And I'm all alone
I'll be singing this song
I wanna be with you, always


I'd be happy, dear
If you could only be here
And always be near
Forever and a day
Then we'd travel far
To some big shinin' star
Just you and my guitar
And stay there, sweetheart, for always


I hope you feel the same
You really want my name
Well, you'll be the one who's to blame
If it works out wrong that day
'Cause my love is true
My love is only for you
I'll never be blue
If I can be with you always
