If jesus came to your house, to spend a day or two
If he came without warning, I wonder what you'd do
Yes if Jesus came to your house, to spend a day or two
If he came unexpected, just dropped in on you
Ahh I know you'd give you nicest room, to such an honored guest
And all the food you'd serve to him, would be your the best
And you would keep reassuring him, that you're glad to have him there
That serving him in your home, is joy beyond compare
But when you saw him coming, would you meet him at the door
With arms out stretched in welcome, to your heavenly visitor
Or would you have to change you clothes, before you'd let him in
Or hide some magazines, and put the bible where they had been
Would you turn off the radio, and hope he hadn't heard
And wish you hadn't uttered, that last loud hasty word
Would you hide your worldly music, and put some hymn books out
Could you just let Jesus walk right in, or would you rush about
And I wonder, if the savior spent a day or two with you
Would you go right on doing, the things you always do
Would you go right on saying, the things you always say
Would life for you continue, as it does from day to day
Would your family conversations, keep up its normal pace
And would you find it hard each meal to say a table grace
Would you sing the songs you always sing
And read the books you read
And let him know the things on which you mind and spirit feed
Would you take Jesus with you everywhere you planned to go
Or maybe would you change your plans, for just a day or so
Would you be glad for him meet your very closest friends
Or hope that they'd stay away, until his visit ends
Would you be glad to have him stay forever on and on
Or would you sigh with great relief, when he at last was gone
It might be interesting to know the things that you would do
If Jesus came in person, to spend some time with you
If Jesus came to your house, I wonder what you'd do
