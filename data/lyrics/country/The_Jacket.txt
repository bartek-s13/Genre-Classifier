It's got a hole in the elbow, bandana pocket
Silver button missin' from the snap at the bottom
I said, "That thing's seen better days, Daddy, you should toss it"
And he just said "Darlin I can’t"

This thing is two-thousand bonfires, a hitchhike to Boulder
It's kept a million raindrops off your mama's shoulders
It’s my heart on my sleeve, my life in these patches
Then he wrapped his arms around me in that old
Jean jacket

It's been a bed for a hound-dog, a picnic blanket
There's blood on the collar from a punk who tried to take it from me
Seen Willie Nelson play four or five states
The best thing Levi ever made

We strung four miles of barbed wire in Corinth, Mississippi
Spent a night in county jail with an old drunk and a hippie
It's my heart on the sleeve, it's my life in these patches
With his arms wrapped around me in that old
Jean jacket
It ain't much to look at, but he let me have it
So I could feel his arms around me in that old
Jean jacket
Jean jacket
