Ending on a bad note
Is like hanging 'round with sad folks
The aftertaste is bitter (ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
But gives you something to be glad for
Well

In these days
We just need to find something to cope
Don't reply to junk mail
Or take the time to vote
'Cause every other day
I see a shooting or a movie
Where the world crumbles faster
Than we ever could've hoped

Landed in the deep end
While tryna save a best friend
I should've got there quicker (ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
But I was too busy flexing
Well

In these days
We just need to find something to love
Don't reply to strangers
Or throw breadcrumbs to the doves
And every other day
I see a shooting or a movie
Where the world crumbles faster
Than we ever would've thought
Oh no
And desperation can be the seed of greed
When everything that you want becomes what you need
And all those little mundane moments in between
Grow dark and fall off beat
I repeat (I repeat, I repeat, I repeat, I repeat)

Driving through Laredo
On my way to New Mexico
Drifting off in deep thought
When I crashed the car

'Cause in these days
We just need something to wake us up
Don't breathe too hard
Or think too much or else you're fucked
And every other day
I see a shooting or a movie
Where the world crumbles faster
Than we ever would've thought

These days
These days
These days
These days
We just need something to wake us up
