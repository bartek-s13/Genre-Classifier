Pearly Shells,from the ocean
Shining in the sun,covering up the shore
When I see themMy heart tells me that I love you,More than all the
Little pearly shells
For every grain of sand upon the beach
I got a kiss for you.And I've got more left over
For each star,that twinkles in the blue
Pearly Shells,from the ocean,shining in te sun
Covering up the shore
When I see them,My heart tells me that I love you 
More than all the little Pearly Shells
MUSIC
For every grain of sand upon the beach
I've got a kiss for you,And I've got more left over,for eac star that
Wtinkles in the blue
Pearly Shells,from the ocean,shining in the sun
Covering up the shore,When I see them
My heart tells me that I love you 
More than all the little Pearly Shells
More than all te little Pearly Shells
