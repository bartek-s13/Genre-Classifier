Passed our exit five ago
Four lanes to county roads
Playlist lighting up the dark
808's and pounding hearts

Won’t tell nobody where we're going
Just you and me and the headlights glowing
Girl don't you know you got the key to my heart
In my car, let’s go far

Lost in the middle of nowhere
Where there is no cares
Me and you out there all alone
Moonlight shining, county riding
Not one bar on our phones
Counting the white lines as they blur by
Till there's gravel on the ground
They won't find us if we don't wanna be found

Lost in the middle of nowhere
Lost in the middle of nowhere
Static building up in here
Where you take me, I don't care
The further we get, the closer we are
Blurring the lines under midnight stars

Won't tell nobody where we're going
Just you and me and the headlights glowing
Yeah boy, I know you got the key to my heart
In your car, take me far

Lost in the middle of nowhere
Where there is no cares
Me and you out here all alone
Moonlight shining, county riding
Not one bar on our phones
Counting the white lines as they blur by
Till there's gravel on the ground
They won’t find us if we don’t wanna be found

Lost in the middle of nowhere
Lost in the middle of nowhere
(Lost in the middle of nowhere, yeah)
We're young and the highway goes on forever
Come on girl, no time to waste, it’s now or never
We're young and the highway goes on forever
And ever and ever

Lost in the middle of nowhere
Where there is no cares
Me and you out here all alone (Out here all alone)
Moonlight shining, county riding
Not one bar on our phones (Not one bar on our phones)
Counting the white lines as they blur by
Till there's gravel on the ground
They won't find us if we don’t wanna be found

Lost in the middle of nowhere (Nowhere)
(Lost in the middle of nowhere, yeah
Lost in the middle of nowhere)
Lost in the middle of nowhere
