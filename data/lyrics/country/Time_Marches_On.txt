Sister cries out, from her baby bed
Brother runs in, feathers on his head
Mama's in her room learnin' how to sew
Daddy's drinkin' beer, listenin' to the radio

Hank Williams sings Kaw-Liga and Dear John
And time marches on, time marches on

Sister's using rouge and clear complexion soap
Brother's wearin' beads and he smokes a lot of dope
Mama is depressed, barely makes a sound
Daddy's got a girlfriend in another town

Bob Dylan sings "Like a Rolling Stone"
And time marches on, time marches on

The South moves north, North moves south
A star is born, a star burns out
The only thing that stays the same is
Everything changes, everything changes
Sister calls herself a sexy grandma
Brother's on a diet for high cholesterol
Mama's out of touch with reality
Daddy's in the ground beneath the maple tree

As the angels sing an old Hank Williams song
Time marches on, time marches on
Time marches on, time marches on
Time marches on, time marches on
