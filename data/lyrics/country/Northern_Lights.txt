Those northern lights got nothing on you
That look in your eyes
Shining brighter than the man up in that moon
Could be looking up there, but they just don't compare
To the way that you look tonight
Those northern lights got nothing on you

Rolling west on the No. 1, chasing down the sinking sun
Eagles soaring on the radio, I love it when you sing along
Just a little off key, but you sound so sweet
Getting lost in the dark, you and I and all the stars
Losing track of time
All of a sudden, like the heavens opened up
And God said, "Let there be light"
The colors dance on the sky
No matter how hard they try

Those northern lights got nothing on you
That look in your eyes
Shining brighter than the man up in that moon
Could be looking up there, but they just don't compare
To the way that you look tonight
Those northern lights got nothing on you
I ain't never seen anything more beautiful, beautiful than you
No, girl, I can't believe that I'm with you

Those northern lights got nothing on you
That look in your eyes
Shining brighter than the man up in that moon
Could be looking up there, but they just don't compare
To the way that you look tonight
Those northern lights got nothing on you
Could be looking up there, but they just don't compare
To the way that you look tonight
Northern lights got nothing on you
