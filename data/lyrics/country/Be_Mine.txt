Baby come in close
Cuz I want you to know
Everything you mean to me
I wanna get this right
You look beautiful tonight
Like you walked straight out of my dreams

Girl your amazing
Would you do me just one thing

Let me be the first thing on your mind when you wake up
The only one you need when the world tries to break ya
Let me be the stars in your sky
The sunshine that kisses your skin in the summer
The one you wanna walk beside until forever
Let me be that guy
Be mine

You've got that crooked little smile
That always drives me wild
Rocks the very heart of me
You're like a song
I wanna play on, and on, and on

Let me be the first thing on your mind when you wake up
The only one you need when the world tries to break ya
Let me be the stars in your sky
The sunshine that kisses your skin in the summer
The one you wanna walk beside until forever
Let me be that guy
Be mine
Oh, oh, oh oh


Let me be the spark that sets your heart on fire
The courage that you need to fly a little higher
The country road that takes you home

The sunshine that kisses your skin in the summer
The one you wanna walk beside until forever
Let me be that guy
Be mine
Let me be that guy
Be mine (oh, oh, oh oh)
Oh, oh, oh oh
Won't you be mine (oh, oh, oh oh)
Be mine
