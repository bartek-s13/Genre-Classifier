I was born in Macon, Georgia
They kept my dad in the Macon jail
Dad said 'Son, if you keep your hands clean -
You won't hear them bloodhounds on your trail
But I fell in with bad companions
We robbed a man in Tennessee
The sheriff caught me
Way up in Nashville
They locked me up and threw away the key
I washed my hands in muddy water
Washed my hands but they didn't come clean
Tried to do like daddy like told me
But I must have washed my hands in a muddy stream
I asked the jailor "When's my time up?"
He said 'Son, we won't forget
And if you try to keep your hands clean
We may make a good man of you yet'
I couldn't wait to do my sentence
Broke out of the Nashville jail
I just crossed the line of Georgia and I can hear them bloodhounds on my trail
I washed my hands...
