When I was fourteen I was fallin' fast
For a blue-eyed girl in my homeroom class
Tryin to find the courage to ask her out
Was like tryin' to get oil from a water spout
What she would've said, I can't say
I never did ask then she moved away
I learned something from my blue-eyed girl
Sink or swim, you gotta give it a whirl

Life's a dance, you learn as you go
Sometimes you lead, sometimes you follow
Don't worry 'bout what you don't know
Life's a dance, you learn as you go

The longer I live the more I believe
You do have to give if you wanna receive
There's a time to listen, a time to talk
And you might have to crawl even after you walk
Had sure things blow up in my face
Seen the long-shot win the race
Been knocked down by the slammin' door
Picked myself up and came back for more
Life's a dance, you learn as you go
Sometimes you lead, sometimes you follow
Don't worry 'bout what you don't know
Life's a dance, you learn as you go


Life's a dance, you learn as you go
Sometimes you lead, sometimes you follow
Don't worry 'bout what you don't know
Life's a dance, you learn as you go

Life's a dance, you learn as you go
Sometimes you lead, sometimes you follow
Don't worry 'bout what you don't know
Life's a dance, you learn as you go

Life's a dance
Life's a dance
Life's a dance
Take a chance on love
Life's a dance
You learn as you go
