Darlin', I still hear your name
Through the windshield wipers and the drivin' rain
I'll be 'cross the rocky mountains in the mornin'
And it's one too many lonely nights
When the highway comes to be the way of life
Seems like about the time I'm gettin' near I'm goin'

Hear that Peterbilt whine down the solid white line
Don't make no money if I don't make it there on time
Houston, Dallas, San Anton', wind it up until I'm home
I've got fourteen gears to get you back in my arms

But if I know that you'll be waitin' there
Then you know that's a weight, girl, that I can bare
I can see your face in the headlights' lonely glare
With the big ol' moon steady on the rise
And the hammer down across the great divide
I'll be pushin' through 'til I'm back where I belong

Hear that Peterbilt whine down the solid white line
Don't make no money if I don't make it there on time
Houston, Dallas, San Anton', wind it up until I'm home
I've got fourteen gears to get you back in my arms

To watch the sunset on the west Arizona sky
To feel the cool wind on a cold El Paso night

Hear that Peterbilt whine down the solid white line
Don't make no money if I don't make it there on time
Houston, Dallas, San Anton', wind it up until I'm home
I've got fourteen gears to get you back in my arms
Woo-hoo

I've got fourteen gears to get you back in my arms
