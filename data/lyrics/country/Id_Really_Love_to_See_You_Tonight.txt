Hello, yeah it's been awhile
Not much how 'bout you?
I'm not sure why I called
Guess I really just wanted to talk to you
And I was thinking maybe later on
We could get together for awhile
It's been such a long time
And I really do miss your smile
I'm not talking 'bout movin' in
And I don't want to change your life
But there's a warm wind blowing the stars around
And I'd really love to see you tonight
We could go walking through a windy park
Or take a drive along the beach
Or stay at home and watch TV
You see it really doesn't matter much to me
I'm not talking 'bout movin' in
And I don't want to change your life
But there's a warm wind blowing the stars around
And I'd really love to see you tonight
I won't ask for promises
So you won't have to lie
We've both played this game before
Say I love you
Say goodbye
I'm not talking 'bout movin' in
And I don't want to change your life
But there's a warm wind blowing the stars around
And I'd really love to see you tonight
I'm not talking 'bout movin' in
And I don't want to change your life
But there's a warm wind blowing the stars around
And I'd really love to see you tonight
