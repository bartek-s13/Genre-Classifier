I can't remember the last time
We sat at the table, just the two of us
Looked into each other's eyes
And made the choice to choose us

Let's trace the steps of where we've been
To make it feel like home again

And you play the stranger
I'll play the girl at the bar
The same place where this all got started
Sometimes I wish I didn't know you at all
So we could do it all over
And fall all over each other again

I know you remember that first night
I asked if you would wanna dance
You made me laugh in the neon light
With your two left feet telling me you can't

Let's trace those steps 'til we can find
Where we got lost in love that time

And you play the stranger
I'll play the girl at the bar
The same place where this all got started
Sometimes I wish I didn't know you at all
So we could do it all over
And fall all over each other again

Let's trace the steps of where we've been
To make it feel like home again

And you play the stranger
I'll play the girl at the bar
The same place where this all got started
Sometimes I wish I didn't know you at all
So we could do it all over
And fall all over each other
Do it all over
And fall all over each other again
