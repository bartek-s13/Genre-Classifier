I'm beating on my lonely drum
Girl don't you want to come over
I'm halfway through a Chardonnay
And I don't plan on stayin' sober
But you can bring your air guitar
Don't let this night get any older
I'm beating on my lonely drum
Girl don't you want to come over
I'm all boom boom boom
So get in your car make it go vroom vroom vroom
There's a dance floor up in my living room room room
I hope your I get here soon...soon
Hey!
I'm beating on my lonely drum
I might get drunk and sing karaoke
You can be my beat box
I'll render some okie from Muskogee
And if you bomb a Jagger shot
I might just do the hokey pokey
I'm beating on my lonely drum
I might get drunk and sing karaoke
I'm all boom boom boom
So get in your car make it go vroom vroom vroom
There's a dance floor up in my living room room room
I hope you get here soon...soon
(Come on girl
Comin' over or what)
I'm beating on my lonely drum
Could your fiat go any slower
You oughta hit the Texaco
And get you some nitro for that motor
If you were here right now
We'd be Johnny and June getting closer
I'm beating on my lonely drum
Tell me that your coming over
I'm all boom boom boom
So get in your car make it go vroom vroom vroom
There's a dance floor up in my living room room room
I hope you get here soon...soon
I wanna sing sing sing
I think you know I'll do anything thing thing
Come on and make my door bell ring ring ring
I hope you get here soon...soon...soon
