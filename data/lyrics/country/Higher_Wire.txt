I don't why it does but it sure do, don't it, honey?
Bein' in love with you is as easy as spendin' money
Keep me higher than the fog, it's a-hidin' my copper line-ups
Yeah, there ain't no landing gear on this big jetliner

Benedictine baby
Chartreuse snake old lady
Appalachia moonshine crazy
Bible belt and a sinner's fire
Love on a higher wire

Brother, it's a mother undercover with a voodoo woman
Roll the dice, bet your life every night, keep the black magic comin'
I should run from you like a vampire does from daylight
But I don't know how to quit 'cause I know what addiction tastes like

Benedictine baby
Chartreuse snake old lady
Appalachia moonshine crazy
Bible belt and a sinner's fire
Love on a higher wire
I rode on twenty
Bet on black
Roll them bones
Drink my Jack
Go all in
Call my bluff
And don't nothin' keep me comin' back again

Benedictine baby
Chartreuse snake old lady
Appalachia moonshine crazy
Bible belt and a sinner's fire
Lo-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
On a higher wire
