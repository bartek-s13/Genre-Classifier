Tonight I told all my friends goodbye and I walked away so they wouldn't see me cry
And hit for swinging doors as fast as I can
For what love had done to me shouldn't happen to a man
And now I find myself sittin' here with you
And you make me wonder why I ever felt blue
You show understanding a few people know
And now that I found you I'll never let you go
Already it's heaven and we've barely met
And you've not even started loving me yet
Cause you've made it sweeter than it's ever been
And if you should love me what would it be then
Already it's heaven the long search is through
And it's so good to know now that heaven is you
