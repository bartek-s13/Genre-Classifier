I been looking to the sky
Looking to the sky
It ain't saying shit back
Guess I’ll be alone tonight
A wrist on my left
A wrist on my right
These people try to tell me that
It’s gon’ be alright
They tell me I should fight
But they don't know the enemy
The enemy is me
My depression and anxiety
“We make quite a pair”
I tell her when she’s next to me
I miss her when she’s there
And more when she ain't next to me

I’m never coming home
Cuz home is where the heartache is
I’m staring at my phone
I know that shit ain't buzzing but I’m
Hoping that it shows
Your name all on the cover of it
Sad and so alone
And fiending for your touch I love it
Kissing on your bones
Kissing on your bones
Kissing on your bones baby
Kissing on your bones
The ghost of you is keeping me awake and moving slow
Slow through the city cozy crying at his shows
Kissing on my neck baby will you be my ho
Guess it’s time to go
Fuck guess it’s time to go

I been looking to the sky
Looking to the sky
It ain't saying shit back
Guess I’ll be alone tonight
A wrist on my left
A wrist on my right
These people try to tell me that
It’s gon’ be alright
They tell me I should fight
But they don't know the enemy
The enemy is me
My depression and anxiety
“We make quite a pair”
I tell her when she’s next to me
I miss her when she’s there
And more when she ain't next to me

I’m never coming home
Cuz home is where the heartache is
I’m staring at my phone
I know that shit ain't buzzing but I’m
Hoping that it shows
Your name all on the cover of it
Sad and so alone
And fiending for your touch I love it
Kissing on your bones
Kissing on your bones
Kissing on your bones baby
Kissing on your bones
The ghost of you is keeping me awake and moving slow
Slow through the city cozy crying at his shows
Kissing on my neck baby will you be my ho
Guess it’s time to go
Fuck guess it’s time to go

I been spending so much time far away
These girls try to stay but you know they never stay
Sex three times this week, what’s today?
I know this ain't okay now
No this ain't okay now
