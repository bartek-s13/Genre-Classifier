Wearing your black dress, red shoes
Makeup, perfume, and diamonds
You always impress, turn heads
The second you walk through the door
You're like a real life work of fine art
Baby, you're priceless
And I just wanna get on, get that black dress down on the floor

'Cause when you got nothin' on
There ain't nothin' wrong
Lovin' you all night long's all I wanna do
I've seen the mountains high
I've sailed the ocean blue
But when you got nothin' on
Ain't nothin' got nothin' on you

You're better than Venice, Vegas, New York, LA, Paris
Baby you're Vermont in the fall
The Grand Canyon on a full moon
Oh and they can keep those highrise, high price mansions
I wouldn't trade places
Long as I'm here with you baby
I've got a room with a view
'Cause when you got nothin' on
There ain't nothin' wrong
Lovin' you all night long's all I wanna do
I've seen the mountains high
I've sailed the ocean blue
But when you got nothin' on
Ain't nothin' got nothin' on you

Yeah, 'cause I've seen the mountains high
I've sailed the ocean blue
But when you got nothin' on
Ain't nothin' got nothin' on you
When you got nothin' on, ain't nothin' got nothin' on you
Ain't nothin' got nothin' on you baby
