And my Lord, He said unto me
Do you like My garden so fair
You may live in this garden if you keep the grasses green
And I'll return in the cool of the day

And my Lord, He said unto me
Do you like my garden so pure
You may live in this garden, if you keep the waters clean
And I'll return in the cool of the day

Now is the cool of the day
Now is the cool of the day
Oh this earth it is a garden, the garden of my Lord
And He walks in His garden
In the cool of the day

And my Lord, He said unto me
Do you like my pastures so green
You may live in this garden if you will feed My lambs
And I'll return in the cool of the day

Now is the cool of the day
Now is the cool of the day
Oh this earth it is a garden, the garden of my Lord
And He walks in His garden
In the cool of the day
And my Lord, He said unto me
Do you like my garden so free
You may live in this garden if you keep the people free
And I'll return in the cool of the day

Now is the cool of the day
Now is the cool of the day
Oh this earth it is a garden, the garden of my Lord
And He walks in His garden
In the cool of the day
Yes He walks in His garden
In the cool of the day
