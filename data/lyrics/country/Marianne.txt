Marianne, I don't wanna wait
The chapel's full but the preacher's late
There's flies around our cake, can you shut the door
My daddy came from a different world
I knew enough when his lips curled
Nobody visits anymore
I watched the faces for a long time
I felt the poison to the water table line
I know there would fall the grace of God
Still feels good to curse the odds
Of knowing what to do
With this old town and you
LBJ didn't start the war
He just limped home wondering what he lost it for
I packed our bags, don't you hesitate
We'll go north or we'll go west
To a place we can reach for our better best
Bring your mama's quilt and let 'em burn the rest
I watched the faces for a long time
I filled the poison to the water table line
I know there would fall the grace of God
Still feels good to curse the odds
Of knowing what to do
Between this town and you
We'll be gone again before it gets too far
And this time, I won't look behind me
We'll be gone again and I know what I'll do
When it's time to choose between this town and you
Between this town and you
Between this town and you
Marianne, I don't wanna wait
The chapel's full but the preacher's late
There's flies around our cake, can you shut the door
