Who you been lovin' since I've been gone
A long tall man with a red coat on
Triflin' baby are you doin' me wrong
Who you been loving since I been gone
Who you been loving since I been gone
Now who's been playing around with you
A real cool cat with eyes of blue
Good-for-nothin' baby why can't you be true
Who's been playing around with you
Who's been playing around with you
Somebody saw you at the break of day
Dancing and a dining at the cabaret
He was long and tall he had plenty of cash
He had a red cadillac and a black moustache
He held your hand and he sang you a song
Who you been loving since I been gone
Who you been loving since I been gone
Somebody saw you at the break of day...
Who you been loving since I been gone
