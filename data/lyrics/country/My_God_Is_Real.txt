There are some things I may not know, there are some places I can't go, but I am sure of this one thing, my God is real for I can feel him in my soul
My God is real, he's real in my soul, my God is real for he has washed and he made me whole, his love for me is like pure gold. My God is real for I can feel him in my soul
I cannot tell just how it felt when Jesus washed my sins away, but since that day yes since that hour, God has been real for I can feel his mighty power
My God is real, he's real in my soul, my God is real for he has washed and made my whole, his love for me, is like pure gold. My God is real for I can feel him in my soul
