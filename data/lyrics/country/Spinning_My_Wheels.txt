I shouldn't think about you
Don't wanna talk about it
Feel like I made a big mistake
I should have opened my eyes
Been smart enough to realize
You couldn't give your heart away
Oh when I feel
Just like a fool
Runnin' in circles
Chasin' you
I've been spinnin' my wheels
I've been wastin' my time
Tried everything I know
Just to get you off my mind
I tried slammin' doors
And talkin' to myself
It's like I'm throwin' quarters
Down an empty wishing well
I've been lookin' for the place to hide
This broken heart from your troubled eyes
They cut me down to size
If I told you that
You never cross my mind
Don't you know that I'd be lyin'
All this gettin' over you
Ain't an easy thing to do but
Lord knows I've been tryin'
But when I feel
Just like a fool
Runnin' in circles
Chasin' you
I've been spinnin' my wheels
I've been wastin' my time
Tried everything I know
Just to get you off my mind
I tried slammin' doors
And talkin' to myself
It's like I'm throwin' quarters
Down an empty wishing well
I've been lookin' for the place to hide
This broken heart from your troubled eyes
They cut me down to size
It's like lightnin' in my veins
Everytime we touch
It can't be good for you they say
If you want it that much
I've been spinnin' my wheels
I've been wastin' my time
Tried everything I know
Just to get you off my mind
I tried slammin' doors
And talkin' to myself
It's like I'm throwin' quarters
Down an empty wishing well
I've been spinnin' my wheels
I've been wastin' my time
Tried everything I know
Just to get you off my mind
I tried slammin' doors
And talkin' to myself
It's like I'm throwin' quarters
Down an empty wishing well
I'm still lookin' for the place to hide
This broken heart, from your troubled eyes
They cut me down to size
