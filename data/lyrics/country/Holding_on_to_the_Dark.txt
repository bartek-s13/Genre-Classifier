I can't breathe, I can't blink
My mind's racing too fast to think
Your silhouette, that falling dress
Got my heart beating out of my chest
I take my hands over your skin
Girl, I'm gonna trace every inch
Let the moonlight shine down
Do what it does until the sun comes up

And pull you in close
Get the two of us forming one shadow
Won't let you go
No we ain't even thinking about tomorrow
I'm gonna follow my fingertips from your hips up to your lips
Get lost in your kiss
Chasing the night 'til the daylight pulls us apart
Holding on to the dark
Holding on, holding on, yeah
Holding on

To hell with the time up on the mantle
Take your time, give me all I can handle
Don't hold back, love can't wait
Baby daybreak is miles away

Let me pull you in close
Get the two of us forming one shadow
Won't let you go
No we ain't even thinking about tomorrow
I'm gonna follow my fingertips from your hips up to your lips
Get lost in your kiss
Chasing the night 'til the daylight pulls us apart
Holding on to the dark
Holding on to the dark

Take my hands over your skin
Girl, I'm gonna trace every inch
Let the moonlight shine down
Do what it does

And pull you in close
Get the two of us forming one shadow
Won't let go
No we ain't even thinking about tomorrow
I'm gonna follow my fingertips from your hips up to your lips
Get lost in your kiss
Chasing the night 'til the daylight pulls us apart
Holding on to the dark
Holding on, holding on, yeah
Holding on
Holding on, holding on, yeah
Holding on
Holding on to the dark
