Making believe that you still love me
It's leaving me alone and so blue
But I'll always dream
Still, I'll never own you
Making believe
It's all I can do
Can't hold you close
When you're not with me
You're somebody's love
You'll never be mine
Making believe
I'll spend my lifetime
Loving you
Making believe
Making believe that I never lost you
But my happy hours I find are so few
My plans for the future will never come true
Making believe
What else can I do?
Can't hold you close
When you're not with me
You're somebody's love
You'll never be mine
Making believe
I'll spend my lifetime
Loving you
Making believe
