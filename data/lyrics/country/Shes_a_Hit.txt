She goes good with the sawdust floor on a Friday
Even better with the windows down on a highway
She's track one on my playlist
She's that one song that I can't skip, oh-woah-oh
She never gets old

I want her over and over
Again and again, stuck on repeat
Got my heartbeat beatin' like a backbeat
Body movin' like a melody, yeah, she's
Everyone's favorite
Gets a whole place lit, wanna turn her up
No, I can't get enough of her love song love
I'm hooked on it
She's a hit
Yeah, she's a hit

She's in my head when I go to bed and when I wake up
She's music to my ears, all I wanna hear, and all I think of (All I think of)
She's a jukebox classic that everyone picks
Know every word, it goes like this, oh-woah-oh
She never gets old
I want her over and over
Again and again, stuck on repeat
Got my heartbeat beatin' like a backbeat
Body movin' like a melody, yeah, she's
Everyone's favorite
Gets a whole place lit, wanna turn her up
No, I can't get enough of her love song love
I'm hooked on it
She's a hit
Yeah, she's a hit
Oh, she's a hit

She never gets old

I want her over and over
Again and again, stuck on repeat
Got my heartbeat beatin' like a backbeat
Body movin' like a melody, yeah, she's
Everyone's favorite
Gets a whole place lit, wanna turn her up
No, I can't get enough of her love song love
I'm hooked on it
She's a hit
Yeah, she's a hit
Oh, she's a hit
She's a hit
