You had a blue jean jacket, burnt CD
Said "you want to go somewhere fast with me?"
I picked you up, yeah
We turned it up

You had a broke-heart necklace, postgame smile
J-Town front page news for a while
Then we broke up
But I still turned it up

Cheerleading skirts in backseats
Free throws and church marquees
Kingsley countdown radio
Wouldn't know nothing if it weren't for all those...

Long nights and glory days
Between the Alpines, and old King James
Yeah the better they look, the sweeter that kiss
The shots you don't take, the shots you gon' miss
The faster the car, more money to burn
You laugh, you love, you live
There's a lot to learn
From speakers and bleachers and preachers
The story of my youth
From speakers and bleachers and preachers
Still got a lot of growing up to do
Kroger parking lot, battle scars
Black and Mild on the dash under the stars
If Daddy asks they ain't mine
82 degrees on the bank sign
And hey-ey, summer jams
Any Chesney song gonna make her dance
When the sun goes down, I think about her now
And all those...

Long nights and glory days
Between the Alpines, and old King James
Yeah the better they look, the sweeter that kiss
The shots you don't take, the shots you gon' miss
The faster the car, more money to burn
You laugh, you love, you live
There's a lot to learn
From speakers and bleachers and preachers
The story of my youth
From speakers and bleachers and preachers
Still got a lot of growing up to do

Subs from my system
Rattle in my rearview
Used to listen, with my cousin
I miss him, he's gone now
It was the national anthem
And a knee-down prayer we were acting
Like we weren't like every other small town
Long nights and glory days
Between the Alpines, and old King James
Yeah the better they look, the sweeter that kiss
The shots you don't take, the shots you gon' miss
The faster the car, more money to burn
You laugh, you love, you live
There's a lot to learn
From speakers and bleachers and preachers
The story of my youth
From speakers and bleachers and preachers
Still got a lot of growing up to do
