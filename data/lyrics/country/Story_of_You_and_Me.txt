We've all got a story 'round here that God wanted to tell
I think about it every now and then when I'm drinking by myself
And I pull that old box of records down
Solid gold
And watch those memories spin around
This is how it goes

Do you ever go down to Paradise City
'Cause I still do, it still gets me high
Not a day goes by that I don't think twice
About letting you down and letting you go
Your car wheels on a gravel road
Sounds so good, feels so bittersweet
The story of you and me

I box the heartbreak up
Put it back on the shelf
So close to letting go but I can't help myself
I gotta turn down the lights and turn up the stereo
And lean my head against the wall and there I go

And I'm back in your arms and Tuesday's gone
Every "I love you" always on my mind
Not a day goes by that I don't think twice
About letting you down and letting you go
Your car wheels on a gravel road
Sounds so good, feels so bittersweet
The story of you and me
And I ain't seen you in forever
But that's alright
I know wherever you are
You look wonderful tonight

Do you ever go down to Paradise City
'Cause I still do, it still gets me high
Not a day goes by that I don't think twice
About letting you down and letting you go
Your car wheels on a gravel road
Sounds so good, feels so bittersweet
Oh it sounds so good, feels so bittersweet
The story of you and me
You and me
