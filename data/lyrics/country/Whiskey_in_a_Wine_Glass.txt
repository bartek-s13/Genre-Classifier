When daddy's little angel with her mama's eyes
Came rolling up straight from the city lights
In a brand new Beemer not made to drive
These dirt roads
I couldn't give myself one reason why
A girl like her would be stopping by
A blue collar town on a Friday night
Yeah, I didn't know
Until she closed down our little hole-in-the-wall
Answering that last call
She's

A little white trash
Little bit of high class
Splash of jack
You better watch your back
She's a sundress, hot mess
Living on the edge
Riding both sides of the tracks
She's whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
In a wine glass

She likes burning up smoke everywhere she goes
From her Marlboro Reds' to the county roads
Yeah, the cover of her book don't make no sense at all
Until she pulls back into that picket fence house
She's lightening up the truth so it don't come out
Mama don't know
Daddy don't see
That side of her that screams


I used to see those angel wings
Now they're starting to shed
And that halo above her head
Is only hanging on by a thread

Cause she's a little white trash
Little bit of high class
Splash of jack
You better watch your back
She's a sundress, hot mess
Living on the edge
Riding both sides of the tracks
She's whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Yeah whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
She's whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
In a wine glass
Yeah, in a wine glass
