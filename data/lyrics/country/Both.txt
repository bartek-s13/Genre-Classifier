Casual, you're keeping it casual
Nothing too meaningful, nothing irrational, no no

So why do you text me saying you miss me?
Staying in my place, it’s kinda confusing
You're blurring the lines, you're playing two sides
Just make up your mind

You can tell me to stay, you can push me away
Have space or get close, but you can’t do both
You can kiss me goodnight or kiss me goodbye
Baby, love me or don't
But you can't do, you can't do both

Impossible, you make it impossible
To know what you really want
It's so irresponsible, yeah, yeah

So what does it mean when you're telling me secrets?
I'm spilling mine and we're just getting deeper
You’re blurring the lines, you’re playing two sides
Just make up your mind

You can tell me to stay, you can push me away
Have space or get close, but you can't do both
You can kiss me goodnight or kiss me goodbye
Baby, love me or don’t
But you can't do, you can't do both


You can tell me to stay, you can push me away
Have space or get close, but you can't do both
You can kiss me goodnight or kiss me goodbye (Woo-hoo)
Baby, love me or don’t (Yeah, yeah)
But you can't do, you can't do both (Mmm, na-na)
You can't do, you can't do both (You can't do both)
(You can't do both) Hey, yeah

So why do you text me saying you miss me?
Staying in my place, it's kinda confusing (But you can't do both)
You're blurring the lines, you're playing two sides (You can't do both, na-na)
Just make up your mind (You can't do both)
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Mmm
