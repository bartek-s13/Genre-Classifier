I never wore any helmets or nothing with petals
Had fights and earned scars and saw all kinds of tears
I chase snakes in all creeks and we let our guns preach peace..
Yes we did..
Back when we were kids

And we believed anything could be done
And we believed in the father and son
And we believed there was nothing they wouldn’t forgive
That’s how we lived back when we were kids


I always stood up for others when I could muster the courage
I might have gotten in trouble, but I never was lost
I drove fast and rode hard
And I broke rules, bones, and hearts
Yes I did
Back when we were kids

But I believe that we learn from mistakes
And I believe that your life is what you make it to be
And I believe you should take all your conscience will give
Just like we did
Back when we were kids


Yeah I believe anything can be done
And I believe in the father and son
And I believe there ain’t nothing that they won't forgive
That’s how it is
Just like it was
Back when we were kids
