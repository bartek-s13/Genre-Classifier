My old man's that old man
Spent his life living off the land
Dirty hands and a clean soul
Breaks his heart seeing foreign cars
Filled with fuel that isn't ours
And wearing cotton we didn't grow

He’s got the red, white, blue flying high on the farm
Semper fi tattooed on his left arm
Spends a little more at the store for a tag in the back that says U-S-A
Won’t buy nothing that he can't fix with WD-40 and a Craftsman wrench
He ain't prejudiced, he's just made in America

His wife, she's that wife that decorates on the 4th of July
But says "every day's Independence Day"
She’s golden rule, teaches school
Some folks say it isn't cool, but she says the Pledge of Allegiance anyway

Got the red, white, blue flying high on the farm
Semper fi tattooed on his left arm
Spends a little more at the store for a tag in the back that says U-S-A
Won’t buy nothing that he can't fix with WD-40 and a Craftsman wrench
He ain't prejudiced, he's just made in America

Born in the heartland, raised up a family
Of King James and Uncle Sam

Got the red, white, blue flying high on the farm
Semper fi tattooed on his left arm
Spends a little more at the store for a tag in the back that says U-S-A
Won’t buy nothing that he can't fix with WD-40 and a Craftsman wrench
He ain't prejudiced, he's just made in America

Made in America
Made in America
My old man's that old man
He’s made in America
America!
