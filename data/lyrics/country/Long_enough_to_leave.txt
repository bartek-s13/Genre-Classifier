You've been picking up this empty house
Washing your hands clean of everything
That has to do with me
Except for the pillow and the sheets
Laying in the floor next to the bed
That never got any sleep
And you can still feel last night inside
Your heart was breaking open wide
I can't stay with you as long as you want me
Stay with you even though i should
Listen to me when i tell you i said some things you misunderstood
You know that i don't want to hurt you i'm trying to make you see
I'll only stay with you long enough to leave
I've been making a mess of what you gave me
Watching the exit signs as they fly by
There keeping me from the truth
Because i left an empty suitcase full of promises i could never keep
Cause that's more than i can do
And i can still hear the sound of your voice
And both we know i don't have a choice
I can't stay with you as long as you want me
Stay with you even though i should
Listen to me when i tell you i said some things you misunderstood
You know that i don't want to hurt you
I'm trying to make you see
I'll only stay with you long enough to leave
You'll have to let me go for now
But hold on tight girl and i'll come back around
And i'll stay with you as long as you want me
Stay with you cause you know i should you listen to me when i tell you
I said some things you misunderstood
You know that i don't want to hurt you
I'm trying to make you see
I'll only stay with you long enough to leave
Yeah i'll only stay with you long enough to leave
