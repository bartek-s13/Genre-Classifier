Noises in my head
And endless should-haves rain on me
Like a storm, like hurricane
Losses piled up like wood stacks stories high
Feels like I've been framed, I have no alibi
Used to be that all I needed
Was what I didn't possess
Hurting makes you who you end up as, more or less
Every choice I made that worked out
Was just a lucky guess, just a lucky guess

Adventures half discarded half held onto now
Dancing on the ledge to the edge somehow
Well I can still pick out the faces
Though I forget the names
In places that I've gone but the urge remains
To throw caution to the wind or is it to the stars
To hold out my open hands
To spite my empty heart
To wear my heart down on my sleeve
Just like a battle scar, these are battle scars

There's comfort in a late night kitchen's radio
And in a letter sent, lists of what you know
When you don't know anything
You make another one
It's good to write it down starting with the sun
And sometimes church bells, trees, and seasons
Marking times gone by
Sometimes starlings swell
Some tidal moons and filled up eyes
Sometimes everything at once
But sometimes just the sky
Sometimes just the sky
