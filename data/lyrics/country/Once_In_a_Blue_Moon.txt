Nine times of ten, she's right and I am wrong
When I won't give in she just goes along
Standing by my side, sitting home alone
I'll never know what keeps her hanging on
When anybody else would be long gone
But once in a blue moon I'll do something right
And Once in a blue moon I'll make her feel so fine
I can make her laugh, And make her cry
She hates the way she loves me sometimes
Once in a blue moon I'll do something right
She's starving for affection, so hungry for loves touch
But she only hears "I love you" when we're making love
Lord, I'll always wonder why she love me so much
And the best I'll ever do won't be enough
So I'll just thank my lucky stars above
But once in a blue moon I'll do something right
And Once in a blue moon I'll make her feel so fine
I can make her laugh, And make her cry
She hates the way she loves me sometimes
Once in a blue moon, once in a blue moon
Every once in a blue moon
I'll do something right
Once in a blue moon...
