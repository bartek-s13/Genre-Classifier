We're just going through the motions
I don't know how we keep it goin'
And I don't wanna stay here, if you don't wanna stay here
Now baby, you were all I ever wanted
But lately, we've lost it and you know it
So if you want to blame me then
I can do the leavin' tonight

Ain't it the hardest part
To admit when you've gone as far
This loves gonna take you
Yeah, I'm gonna miss you

We're just going through the motions
I don't know how we keep it goin'
And I don't wanna stay here, if you don't wanna stay here
Now baby, you were all I ever wanted
But lately, we've lost it and you know it
So if you want to blame me then
I can do the leavin' tonight

I'm not angry
And I don't want to fight
We've said everything
Everything but goodbye
We're just going through the motions
I don't know how we keep it goin'
And I don't wanna stay here, if you don't wanna stay here
Now baby, you were all I ever wanted
But lately, we've lost it and you know it
So if you want to blame me then
I can do the leavin' tonight
If it makes it easy, then I can do the leavin' tonight
Goodbye
