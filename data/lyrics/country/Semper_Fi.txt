He sat in that long line of barber chairs
And the Sergeant asked him, "Son, would you like to keep your hair?"
He said, "Yes sir" as he heard those clippers buzz and hum
The sergeant said, "Well hold out your hands, 'cause here it comes"

Semper Fi, do or die
So gung ho, to go and pay the price
Here's to Leathernecks, Devil Dogs, and Jarheads
And Parris Island in July, Semper Fi

I sleep in my bed instead of a foxhole
I've never heard my boss tell me to lock n load
Ain't no bullet holes in the side of my SUV
Because the kid next door just shipped out overseas

Semper Fi, do or die
So gung ho, to go and pay the price
Here's to Leathernecks, Devil Dogs, and Jarheads
And Parris Island in July, Semper Fi

For the few that wear the dress blues
With hair cut high and tight
Who are proud to be the first ones in the fight
Semper Fi
Semper Fi, do or die
So gung ho, to go and pay the price
Here's to Leathernecks, Devil Dogs, and Jarheads
And Parris Island in July
Never leave a man behind
A marine, a marine for life, Semper Fi
