When there's still a little month at the end of the money
When you're runnin' out of room between your back and that wall
When the tide won't turn
And when your live won't learn, when the hurt keeps hurting
When your hope gets hit with a wrecking ball

Fight like hell
Don't you back down
Answer that bell
Stand your ground
Don't you give up
When the going gets tough
Fight like hell

When you drink too big
And the town keeps talking
When the told you so's get a little too loud
When your job gets jacked, can't catch no slack, the odds keep stacking up
And you're about to throw in the towel

Fight like hell
Don't you back down
Answer that bell
Stand your ground
Don't you give up
When the going gets tough
Fight like hell
When the rain keeps fallin', fallin' on you
The weight of the world is weighing on you
And all you got's the end of your rope
When your heart keeps breaking, aching on you
Haters keep hating on you
Ain't but really one way to go

Fight like hell
Don't you back down
Answer that bell
Stand your ground
Don't you give up
When the going gets tough
Fight like hell
Fight like hell
Fight like hell
Fight like hell
Fight like hell
Fight like hell
