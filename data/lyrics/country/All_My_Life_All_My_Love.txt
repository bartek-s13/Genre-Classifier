All of my life I’ll give you all of my love
This I promise to you, I will be true
Near or apart, you’re always here in my heart
You were meant to be the only one for me
All my life I’m giving you all of my love
That’s one thing time will never change
You’re in my heart, and on my side
Stay with me all of my life
Through all the years, through all the joys and the tears
Side by side, dreaming our dreams
We’re like the stars in the sky
Forever we shine, you will always be beautiful to me
All my life I’m giving you all of my love
That’s one thing time will never change
You’re in my heart, and on my side
Stay with me all of my life
All my life, giving you all of my love
That’s one thing time will never change
You’re in my heart, and on my side
Stay with me all of my life
Stay with me
