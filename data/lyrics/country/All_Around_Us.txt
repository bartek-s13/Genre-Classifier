I was an out of control, outlaw soul
Spinnin' my wheels down a windin' road to no where
Yeah, then out of no where
Debris was flyin' I was pulled from the flames
They shook off the dust and asked my name
He said "Son you're gonna be alright, no it ain't your time
I'm gonna give you somethin' that was given to me
And you'll understand what I did when you hit John 15:13"

There are angels all around us
Watchin' over you and me
There the ones you don't always see
Could be a neighbor, could be a stranger
When you're runnin' low on luck
You don't always have to look up
They're all around us
They're all around us

Fast forward a few into my new life
Celabratin' the first year with my wife
And the city lights that we walk by
A broken soul dressed in rags
So I gave him all the cash I had
With a tear in his eyes, he asked me "Why
Would a guy like you help a guy like me?"
I said "It took a while to learn but when I took a wrong turn
Someone else showed me
There are angels all around us
Watchin' over you and me
There the ones you don't always see
Could be a neighbor, could be a stranger
When you're runnin' low on luck
You don't always have to look up
They're all around us

I must have sparked a light
'Cause later on that night
That same broken soul put himself in between
Myself and a switchblade knife
Right before he lost his life
He looked me in the eyes and said to me

There are angels all around us
Watchin' over you and me
There the ones you don't always see
Could be a neighbor, could be a stranger
When you're runnin' low on luck
You don't always have to look up
They're all around us
Yeah, they're all around us
