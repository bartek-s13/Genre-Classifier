Ooh

There's an old man playin' a flattop
On a handmade rocking chair
Oh god, it sounds so good
Yeah that feeling's there
You can hear the years, sweat and tears
Everythin' in between coming through them callous hands
Banging on them strings, it's in the heartbeat

It's in the heartbeat
It's in the real thing
You can't make it up
It's in your soul deep
It's in the stars, the stripes, this dirt on my feet
The way I love my woman &amp; the way she loves me
It's in the heartbeat

Yeah, y'all put those hands together!

Ooh
Well, I lost my job at the power mill
To a man and his machine
But you can't replace these two hands with metal bolts and steam
So here's my plan, brother man, Yeah, I will be just fine
Cause I got my back, ain't got no slack, and this good ole spirit of mine


Roller Coaster, butterflies
Lowest lows or highest highs
Catch a little air on a jeep ride, Friday night
It's the game you lost, the game you won
The greatest thing you've ever done
And tell me, have you ever really loved someone?!

Cause when you love someone...
Yeah, when you love someone.... it's in your heartbeat


Yeah!
