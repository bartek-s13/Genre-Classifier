If only Dad would have spanked me instead

I might have turned out to be a regular guy
But its all that I know and I gotta get high
So lets put on some Soul Train and snort a little cocaine
Ill chop some lines maybe one at a time till were feeling no pain
Ill bite my tongue till its numb and Ill talk till I drive you insane
