Looking at you through a misty moonlight
Katydid sing like a symphony
Porch swing swaying like a Tennessee lullaby
Melody blowing through the willow tree
What was I s'posed to do
Standing there looking at you?
Lonely boy far from home...
Maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was southern summer nights
Maybe it was you, maybe it was me
But it sure felt right
Read about you in a Faulkner novel
Met you once in a Williams' play
Heard about you in a country love song
Summer night beauty took my breath away
What was I s'posed to do
Standing there looking at you?
Lonely boy far from home
Maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was southern summer nights
Maybe it was you, maybe it was me
But it sure felt right
Maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was southern summer nights
Maybe it was you, maybe it was me
But it sure felt right
Every night now since I been back home
I lie awake drifting in my memory
Think about you on your mama's front porch swing
Talking that way, so soft to me
What was I s'posed to do
Standing there looking at you?
Lonely boy far from home
Maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was southern summer nights
Maybe it was you, maybe it was me
But it sure felt right
