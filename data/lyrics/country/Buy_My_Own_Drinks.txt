Mmm yeah
Mmm hmm

Well since we been done
I’ve been trying to un-fall apart
And I’ve been thinking that some neon lights
Would be a real good start
Well I called a couple friends
But they all say they’re staying in
So I guess I’m going out on my own
I might be heart broke
But that don’t mean that I gotta stay home, yeah

I can buy my own drinks
And I can pay my own tab
And at the end of the night when they cut on all the lights
I can call my own cab
I can drop my own change in the jukebox
I can dance all by myself
‘Til I can stop thinkin’ ‘bout drinkin’ ‘bout him
I don’t need nobody else
Yeah, I can buy my own drinks
(Tonight, tonight, tonight)
Yeah, I can buy my own drinks
(Tonight, tonight, tonight)
I found myself a dive
The type that he would never walk in
And then a guy at the bar sees an empty drink in my hand
Yeah, I said, "It's sweet of you to ask
If you could fill my glass
But I’m gonna have to pass this time"
Me and myself, well, yeah we’re doing just fine

I can buy my own drinks
And I can pay my own tab
And at the end of the night when they cut on all the lights
I can call my own cab
I can drop my own change in the jukebox
I can dance all by myself
‘Til I can stop thinkin’ ‘bout drinkin’ ‘bout him
I don’t need nobody else
Yeah, I can buy my own drinks
(Tonight, tonight, tonight)
Yeah, I can buy my own drinks
(Tonight, tonight, tonight)

I can walk my own self to the front door
I can take my own self to bed
I can medicate my own headache
Yeah, I can be my own boyfriend
And I can buy my own drinks
I can pay my own tab
And at the end of the night when they cut on all the lights
I can call my own cab
I can drop my own change in the jukebox
I can dance all by myself (No time to stop)
‘Til I can stop thinkin’ ‘bout drinkin’ ‘bout him
I don’t need nobody else
Yeah, I can buy my own drinks
(Tonight, tonight, tonight)
Yeah, I can buy my own drinks
(Tonight, tonight, tonight)

I can drop my own change in the jukebox
(Tonight, tonight, tonight)
(Thinkin’ ‘bout drinkin’ ‘bout him)
I can dance all by myself
(Tonight, tonight, tonight)
