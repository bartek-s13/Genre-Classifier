I caught a .22 bullet inn the thigh one night
Trying to break up a barroom fight
Went home, cut it out with my ol' Case knife
Broke down in a blizzard on the great divide
Walked twenty miles 'til I caught a ride
Trooper said, "Boy it's a wonder you're still alive"
I've rode hard luck
I've been bruised and bucked
I've been hitting the ground
And turning around
And getting back up
And they're laying 'em off down at Kankakee
And there's boards on the windows up and down the street
And they're saying that it's gonna get darker before the dawn
But you can bet your ass I'll keep the lights on
Keep my babies fed and throw my dog a bone
Cause I'm a bring it on, git 'er done, don't run S.O.B
Times are tough
But they ain't got nothing on me
I got a three-legged dog I call Jake
Got the won't back down scars on his face
He tussled with a bear and he came in second place
He comes back home every now and then
With some brand new scars that I have to mend
You know I'm proud to call ol' Jake my friend
Cause he's rode hard luck
He's been bruised and bucked
He's been hitting the ground
And turning around
And getting back up
And now they're laying 'em off down at Kankakee
And there's boards on the windows up and down the street
And they're saying that it's gonna get darker before the dawn
But you can bet your ass I'll keep the lights on
Keep my babies fed and throw my dog a bone
Cause I'm a bring it on, git 'er done, don't run S.O.B
Times are tough
But they ain't got nothing on me
