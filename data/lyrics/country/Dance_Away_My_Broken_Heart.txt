Oh, I'm so over calling my mama
Yeah and all my friends are tired of hearing all my drama
Sitting at home in my pyjamas
When I got a new dress hanging in my closet

I think I'm gonna put it on
I think I'm gonna show it off
And give it all I got

Yeah, tonight I'm gonna dance away my broken heart
My broken heart, like I never even loved him
Throw my hands up when the music starts
Shake off these scars
Like he ain't got nothing left on me
Gonna find a new rhythm till I forget him
Gonna move on till the memory fades
Yeah, tonight I'm gonna dance away my broken heart
My broken heart, oh woah

Tall, dark and handsome (I see you) across the room
I let him spin me round, I let him make a move
Because I can now that you're gone and I'm moving on
Like there ain't nothing wrong
Yeah, tonight I'm gonna dance away my broken heart
My broken heart, like I never even loved him
Throw my hands up when the music starts
Shake off these scars
Like he ain't got nothing left on me
Gonna find a new rhythm till I forget him
Gonna move on till the memory fades
Yeah, tonight I'm gonna dance away my broken heart
My broken heart, oh woah
My broken heart, baby
My broken heart

Here we go
And it's a couple steps to the left
I forget how he left
Then move to the right
And it starts to feel alright again
Drop it low 'cause I ain't feeling low no more
Leave it all on the floor

Yeah, tonight I'm gonna dance away my broken heart
My broken heart, like I never even loved him
Throw my hands up when the music starts
Shake off these scars
Like he ain't got nothing left on me
Gonna find a new rhythm till I forget him
Gonna move on till the memory fades
Yeah, tonight I'm gonna dance away my broken heart
My broken heart, oh woah
My broken heart, baby
Dance away, dance away, dance away now
