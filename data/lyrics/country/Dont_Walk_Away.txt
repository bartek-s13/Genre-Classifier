Written by: Stephen Allen Davis / Boo Hewerdine
Confrontation ain't your thing
You say that laying blame won't do no good now
So before you go and say goodbye
And move on with your life I wish you would somehow
Give me a reason to believe
That everything you're gonna leave behind
Is a waste of time and ain't worth fighting for
Chorus:
Slam the door, yell out loud
Don't hold it in, let it out
Put me down, put up a fight
I can be wrong, you can be right
Just get mad, is that too much to ask
But, don't walk away, walk away like that
Don't walk away, walk away like that
Kicking me in the teeth would be better than leaving me untouched
So try
Cause all the words we never say
The wars unwaged have started stacking up
So high
There may not be a way to make you
Wanna stay and try to save our love
But if it can't be like it was before
Repeat Chorus
Give me a reason to believe
That everything you're gonna leave behind
Is a waste of time and ain't worth fighting for
Repeat Chorus
