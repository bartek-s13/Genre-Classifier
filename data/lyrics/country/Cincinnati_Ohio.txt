(Cincinnati, Ohio
Cincinnati, Ohio)
One more hour and I'll be home
Close my eyes and rest my bones
Can't be more than a mile or so
From Cincinnati, Ohio
Cincinnati, Ohio
Cincinnati
Where the river winds cross the Mason and the Dixie Line
Heaven waits for me
I know
In Cincinnati, Ohio
Cincinnati, Ohio
I guess perhaps the memories got too strong
Grabbed me by the heart strings
And pulled me home
I got to thinkin' bout some friends
I know in Cincinnati, Ohio
Cincinnati, Ohio
(Cincinnati Ohio
Cincinnati Ohio)
I walked half way from Louisville
Now there she lies at the foot of the hill
Shinin' like a jewel in the valley
Below Cincinnati, Ohio
Cincinnati, Ohio
Cincinnati
Where the river winds...
Cincinnati
Where the river winds...
