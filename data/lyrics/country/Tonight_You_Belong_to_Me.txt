Though you belong to somebody else tonight you belong to me
And though we're apart you're part of my heart tonight you belong to me
Down by the stream how sweet it will seem once more to dream in the moonlight
And though with the dawn I know you'll be gone tonight you belong to me
(Down by the stream how sweet it will seem) once more to dream in the moonlight
And though with the dawn I know you'll be gone tonight you belong to me
Tonight you belong to me
