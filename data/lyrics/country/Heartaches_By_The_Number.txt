Heartache number 1 was when you left me
I never knew that I could hurt this way
And heartache number 2 was when you come back again
You came back but never meant to stay
Now I've got heartaches by the number
Troubles by the score
Every day you love me less
Each day I love you more
Yes, I've got heartaches by the number
A love that I can't win
But the day that I stop counting
That's the day my world will end
Heartache number 3 was when you called me
And said that you was coming back to stay
With hopeful heart I waited for your knock on the door
I waited but you must have lost your way
Now I've got heartaches by the number
Troubles by the score
Every day you love me less
Each day I love you more
Yes, I've got heartaches by the number
A love that I can't win
But the day that I stop counting
That's the day my world will end
