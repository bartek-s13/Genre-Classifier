You're the lucky one
So I've been told
As free as the wind
Blowing down the road
Loved by many, hated by none
I'd say you're lucky 'cause I know what you've done
Not a care in the world
Not a worry in sight
Everything's gonna be alright
Cause you're the lucky one

You're the lucky one
Always having fun
A jack of all trades a master none

You look at the world with a smiling eye
And laugh at the devil as his train goes by
Give you a song and a one night stand
And you'll be looking at a happy man
'cause you're the lucky one
Well you're blessed i guess
By never knowing which road your choosing
To you the next best thing
To playing and winning is playing and losing
You're the lucky one
I know that now
Don't ask you why, when, where, or how

You look at the world through your smiling eye
And laugh at the devil as his train goes by
Give you a song and a one night stand
And you'll be looking at a happy man
'cause you're the lucky one
Well you're blessed I guess
By never knowing which road your choosing
To you the next best thing
To playing and winning is playing and losing
You're the lucky one I know that now
Don't ask you why, when, where, or how
No matter where you're at, it's where you'll be
You can bet your luck won't follow me
Just give you a song and a one night stand
And you'll be looking at a happy man
Cause you're the lucky one
