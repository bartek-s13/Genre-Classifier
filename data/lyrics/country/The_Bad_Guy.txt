Last night I was on the selfish side of lonely when I called you
I was weak, I knew damn well that you'd pick up
When I told you that I missed you, I meant it
But we both know why we ended
There was nothing left to say
So I guess I'll take the blame

Go ahead and hate me if you want to
Tell everybody that I did you wrong
That my blindsided slamming door came out of the blue
And it was easy for me to just move on
When the truth is that I loved you but you waited too long to fight
Yours ain't the only heart that broke that night
But since I'm the one who said goodbye
You can be the good man who was only trying to love me
And I will be the bad guy

Could've stayed yeah
When you said that you'd do better
And don't think I don't wonder
When I'm lyin' here wide awake
If I quit too soon, but baby
Yeah deep down, I knew the only way was out

So go ahead and hate me if you want to
Tell everybody that I did you wrong
That my blindsided slamming door came out of the blue
And it was easy for me to just move on
When the truth is that I loved you but you waited too long to fight
Yours ain't the only heart that broke that night
But since I'm the one who said goodbye
You can be the good man who was only trying to love me
And I will be the bad guy

Go ahead and hate me if you want to
Tell everybody that I did you wrong
That my blindsided slamming door came out of the blue
And it was easy for me to just move on
When the truth is that I loved you but you waited too long to fight
Yours ain't the only heart that broke that night
But since I'm the one who said goodbye
You can be the good man who was only trying to love me
And I will be the bad guy
