You fought all the way
Johnny Reb, Johnny Reb
You fought all the way, Johnny Reb
Saw you a-marchin' with Robert E. Lee
You held your head high tryin' to win the victory
You fought for your folks, but you didn't die in vain
Even tho' you lost they speak highly of your name, 'cause
You fought all the way
Johnny Reb, Johnny Reb
You fought all the way, Johnny Reb
I heard your teeth chatter from the cold outside
Saw the bullets open up the wounds in your side
I saw the young boys as they began to fall
You had tears in your eyes 'cause you couldn't help at all, but
You fought all the way
Johnny Reb, Johnny Reb
You fought all the way, Johnny Reb
I saw Gen'ral Lee raise a sabre in his hand
Heard the cannons roar as you made your last stand
You marched in the battle of the Grey and the Red
When the cannon smoke cleared, took days to count the dead, 'cause
You fought all the way
Johnny Reb, Johnny Reb
You fought all the way, Johnny Reb
When Honest Abe heard the news about your fall
The folks thought he'd call a great vict'ry ball
But he asked the band to play the song Dixie
For you, Johnny Reb, and all that you believe
You fought all the way
Johnny Reb, Johnny Reb
Yeah, you fought all the way, Johnny Reb
You fought all the way
Johnny Reb, Johnny Reb
You fought all the way, Johnny Reb
