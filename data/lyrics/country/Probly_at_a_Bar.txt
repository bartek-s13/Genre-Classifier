I could be hitting my limit in an old duck blind
On a flood rise field in the delta sunrise
With a few good back-home buddies I ain't seen in a while
Or I could be standing knee-deep with my toes in the sand
On a Carolina coast with a pole in my hand
Reeling in reds, popping tops, and dropping limes
Ya I reckon there's a chance but chances are

I'm probably at a bar
And drinking 'bout you
And driving this heart like I got nothing left to lose
I could be anywhere under the sun, over the moon
But chances are I'm probably at a bar

We were seventh inning stretching at a July Braves game
Watching those fireworks high above the highway
When you kissed me, you knocked me right out of the park
These days I'm just wondering where you are
But me

I'm probably at a bar
And drinking 'bout you
And driving this heart like I got nothing left to lose
I could be anywhere under the sun, over the moon
But chances are I'm probably at a bar
I could be anywhere in the world
But chances are I'm probably at a bar
Drinking 'bout you
And driving this heart like I got nothing left to lose
[Chorus}
I'm probably at a bar
And drinking 'bout you
And driving this heart like I got nothing left to lose
I could be anywhere under the sun
Over the moon but chances are
I could be anywhere getting over you
But chances are I'm probably at a bar

I'm probably at a bar
