Sure is hard to remember
Life before you walked in the picture
I was a sad Mona Lisa with a crooked frame
Standing on my platform, waiting for my train

I was messed up, wondering, broke down, stumbling
Running for my life
Was heartbroke, hard up, a long string of bad luck
Searching with no end in sight

Before you called me baby
Before you looked me in the eyes
I had nothing left to save me
Before you called me, before you called me
Before you called me baby

It's like the walls soaked down and the lights turned on
And the band started playing a different song
Like I was baptized by the fire in your kiss
No I've never, ever, ever felt like this

Before you called me baby
Before you looked me in the eyes
I had nothing left to save me
Before you called me, before you called me
Before you called me baby
Before you called me baby
I was drowning, wasted, lost and jaded
Hanging by a thread
I was sinking, shook up, and almost gave up
On this lonely heart in my chest

Before you called me baby
Before you looked me in the eyes
I had nothing left to save me
Before you called me, before you called me
Before you called me baby, before you called me baby
Before you called me baby, baby, baby, baby
