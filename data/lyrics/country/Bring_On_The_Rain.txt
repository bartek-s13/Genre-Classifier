Ooh

Another day has almost come and gone
Can’t imagine what else could wrong
Sometimes I’d like to hide away somewhere and lock the door
A single battle lost but not the war

'Cause tomorrow’s another day
And I’m thirsty anyway
So bring on the rain

It’s almost like the hard times circle ‘round
A couple drops and they all start coming down
Yeah, I might feel defeated
I might hang my head
I might be barely breathing
But I’m not dead

'Cause tomorrow’s another day
And I’m thirsty anyway
So bring on the rain

No, I’m not gonna let it get me down
I’m not gonna cry
And I’m not gonna lose any sleep tonight

'Cause tomorrow's another day
And I am not afraid
So bring on the rain

Tomorrow’s another day
And I’m thirsty anyway
So bring on the rain

Ooh
Bring on, bring on the rain
No, I'm not gonna let it get me down
I'm not gonna cry
So bring on the rain (ay-e-ay-e-ain)
Ooh
Bring on, bring on the rain
Bring on the rain (rain)
Bring on the rain
Bring on the rain
Ooh
