Riding shotgun in his F150
Pedal to the medal and his hand on my knee
Taking every turn just a little too fast
Rebel with a cause yeah and I’m the crash
Past the point of no return
Angel on my shoulder don’t say a word…

Oh slipping off your white tee
You’re a snake and I’m eve
Oh the way you're looking at me
Looking like we might be
In for a hell of a night
So wrong but feels so right
What's a good girl supposed to do
When she’s caught up in between the devil and you?
Caught up in between the devil and you?

Babylon boy I’m diggin' what your saying lead me down the road south of salvation
Mama didn’t raise a heart to be breaking but I’m bout to be a soul that needs saving
Past the point of no return
Devil on my shoulder he’s winning the war…
Oh slipping off your white tee
You’re a snake and I’m eve
Oh the way you're looking at me
Looking like we might be
In for a hell of a night
So wrong but feels so right
What's a good girl supposed to do
When she’s caught up in between the devil and you?
Caught up in between the devil and you?

Past the point of no return
Angel on my shoulder don’t say a word
Past the point of no return
Devil on my shoulder he’s winning the war

Oh slipping off your white tee
You’re a snake and I’m eve
Oh the way you're looking at me
Looking like we might be
In for a hell of a night
So wrong but feels so right
Whats a good girl supposed to do
When she’s caught up in between the devil and you?
Caught up in between the devil and you?
