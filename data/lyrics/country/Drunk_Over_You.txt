Been a couple weeks since you up and left
And I ain't gonna lie, girl, I've been a wreck
Goin' out every night tryin' to forget
With some help from my friends Johnnie, Jack, and Jim

Gettin' so faded
Tryin' not to face it
But every sip I'm takin'
It only makes me miss you more

Thought I could patch myself up at this hole in the wall
And burn down your memory with this fireball
But the more I drink, the more I find
Gettin' drunk over you is just wasted time
Gettin' drunk over you
Gettin' drunk over you
Yeah the more I drink, the more I find
Gettin' drunk over you is just wasted time

At the bottom of the bottle tryin' to make it through
Hangin' on by a thread tryin' to cut you loose
And every time that my mind wants to think of you
I go 0 to 100 on that 100 proof
Gettin' so faded
Tryin' not to face it
But every sip I'm takin'
It only makes me miss you more

Thought I could patch myself up at this hole in the wall
And burn down your memory with this fireball
But the more I drink, the more I find
Gettin' drunk over you is just wasted time
Gettin' drunk over you
Gettin' drunk over you
Yeah the more I drink, the more I find
Gettin' drunk over you is just wasted time

I'll catch a flight down to Cabo
I'll do some fishin' up in Colorado
Yeah the only thing that I know is
I'm movin' on

Thought I could patch myself up at this hole in the wall
And burn down your memory with this fireball
But the more I drink, the more I find
Gettin' drunk over you is just wasted time
Can't patch myself up at this hole in the wall
And burn down your memory with this fireball
But the more I drink, the more I find
Gettin' drunk over you is just wasted time
Wasted time
Yeah the more I drink, the more I find
Gettin' drunk over you is just wasted time
