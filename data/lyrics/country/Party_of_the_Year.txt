I don't know who the band is or the song they're playing
Gotta say I;m so glad I ran into ya
Yeah it's been a while
You still look the same, why nothing's changed
You know just when to show up
Now I can't go home, can't leave you alone, find a reason to stay
What cha say we throw it back act like we did in our high school days
Make this party a party yeah
Boy get over here for the party of the year
And everybody else gone, get invited
Just me and you doin’ what we do
I like it
I ain’t tryin’a hide it
Get over here
Let me whisper in your ear
What I got in mind tonight
Tomorrow ?
About the party of the year
The party of the year
Never forgot the way your kiss felt
It’s a little bit better now
Funny how you never really can tell
When your night’s gonna turn around
From watching the door
To wanting you more
Than I ever have
What cha say we throw it back act like we did in our high school days
Boy get over here for the party of the year
And everybody else gone, get invited
Just me and you doin’ what we do
I like it
I ain’t tryin’a hide it
Get over here
Let me whisper in your ear
What I got in mind tonight
Tomorrow ?
