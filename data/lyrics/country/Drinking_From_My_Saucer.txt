I'm drinking from my saucer cause my cup has overflowed
You know I never did make my fortune and I guess it's a little late now
But I never did worry about that much
No shoot I was happy anyhow cause you see
As I have journeyed down life's road
I have reaped a lot more than I've sowed
And I'm drinking from my saucer cause my cup has over flowed
No I'm not a man of riches
No sir and sometimes the going gets kinda' rough
But I got me a good family an old horse and a dog
They all love me well that makes me rich enough
I thank the Lord for all these bless the mercies he has bestowed
I'm drinking from my saucer cause my cup has overflowed
Oh I've had lots of times when it seemed everything went wrong
I could feel my faith get well just a little bit thin
But the rain would stop and dark clouds would roll away
The sun would come shining right back down in my life again
So Lord don't let me gripe too much about the rough row I've hoed
'Cause I'm drinking from my saucer my cup has overflowed
I'm drinking from my saucer my cup has overflowed
And now Lord if you can just give me the strength I need
And the courage when that old road gets steep and rough
I'll not ask for any other blessing 'cause I have been blessed more than enough
And Lord don't ever let me get so busy that I can't help another with his load
And I just keep on drinking from my saucer cause my cup has surely overflowed
I'm drinking from my saucer cause my cup has overflowed
Thanks Lord
