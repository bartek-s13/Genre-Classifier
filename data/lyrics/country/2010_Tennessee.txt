Hey it's me
I'm just wondering where you are
I woke up late
I think the game's about to start
You know where I'll be
Just sitting here at home, let's go Tennessee
Me again, you won't believe what just went down
3rd and goal, fake reverse and around, even fooled the referees
Just had to let you know, it's 7-zip Tennessee
And by the way I meant to say, that I'm sorry 'bout last night
I didn't mean to make you cry, but did you really mean goodbye?
I swear to God I'm going to change
Turn this fool I've been around
I believe in miracles, cause hell I'm watching one right now
And girl you won't believe
It's going into half
10-nothing Tennesee
We scored again
That's all I called again to say
It got real close
But just like you we pulled away
Almost out of reach
But it ain't over yet
Now hold on Tennessee!
I swear to God I'm going to change
Turn this fool I've been around
I believe in miracles
Cause hell I'm watching one right now
Girl you won't believe
2 minutes left
It's looking good Tennessee
Should have been another best day of my life
But girl I feel, kind of like the Crimson Tide
With time running out on me
No Hail Mary chance, 20-10 Tennessee!
