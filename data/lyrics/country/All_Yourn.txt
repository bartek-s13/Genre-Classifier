Drivin' through the road work, oh, the work they took forever on
The road cones blur like mem'ries of the miles we shared between
The place you learned to say your prayers, the place I took to prayin'
Loadin' in and breakin' down my road dog door deal dreams
Long before we ever met, I made up my direction
Long before I knew the half of half I'm sure of now
Though I'd say it ain't the way that you'd have gone about it
You follow me and lead me on and never let me down

So I'll love you 'til my lungs give out, I ain't lyin'
I'm all your'n and you're all mine
There ain't two ways around it
There ain't no tryin' 'bout it
I'm all your'n and you're all mine

Fried morels and fine hotels and all that in the middle
Every bite and curtain drawn, I wanna taste with you
Goddess in my Days Inn pen, the muse I ain't refusin'
The part of me that ain't around I'm always talking to

So I'll love you 'til my lungs give out, I ain't lyin'
I'm all your'n and you're all mine
There ain't two ways around it
There ain't no tryin' 'bout it
I'm all your'n and you're all mine
So I'll love you 'til my lungs give out, I ain't lyin'
I'm all your'n and you're all mine
There ain't two ways around it
There ain't no tryin' 'bout it
I'm all your'n and you're all mine
No, there ain't two ways around it
There ain't no tryin' 'bout it
I'm all your'n and you're all mine
