His eyes are blue just like the ocean
His heart is a river free
And now and then he gets the notion
And he finds his way to me

His love's like rain on a tin roof
A sweet song of a summertime storm
And oh, the way that it moves you
It's a melody of passion ragin' on
And then it's gone

He tells me he'll be back to see me
Every time he has to go
And I keep wonderin' just when that'll be
'Cause with him ya never know

His love's like rain on a tin roof
A sweet song of a summertime storm
And oh, the way that it moves you
It's a melody of passion ragin' on
And then it's gone

And just like a thirsty field, I can't complain a bit
'Cause I'm thankful for every single drop I get

His love's like rain on a tin roof
A sweet song of a summertime storm
And oh, the way that it moves you
It's a melody of passion ragin' on
And then it's gone

His love's like rain on a tin roof
A sweet song of a summertime storm
And oh, the way that it moves you
It's a melody of passion ragin' on
And then it's gone
And then it's gone, then it's gone
