Go, boy go, love is easy made
All you gotta know is the tricks of the trade
Her eyes will tell you yes or no
And when you get the signal go boy go
Hug her tight with all your might
Be different from the rest
And when she's near whisper
Dear, you're the one that I love best
Go, boy go, when the time is right
Take advantage of the pretty moon light
Don't you lose your gal 'cause you're too slow
And when you get the signal, go, boy go
Go, boy go, loves is really green
When she's in the moon don't hesitate
She'll have some way to let you know
And when you get a signal go boy go
Hug her tight with all your might
Be different from the rest
And when she's near whisper
Dear, you're the one that I love best
Go, boy go, when the time is right
Take advantage of the pretty moon light
Don't you lose your gal 'cause you're too slow
And when you get the signal, go, boy go
