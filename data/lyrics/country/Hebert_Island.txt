When it's dry I take the road
When the water's high I take a boat
Paradise with fishin' poles
A pair o' dice and dominos
A piece o' land a man can find
Piece of mind in a patch of pines
Just inside that Texas line
Livin' on Louisiana time

On Hebert Island
Down in Dixie
Jambalaya
And beer and whiskey
City folk
They don't go
'Cause they don't know
How to fais-do-do
Yeah that's for sure
When that storm blows in we headed for the highland
We're from  Hebert Island

Red-tailed duck wrapped in tinfoil
Catfish fryin' in peanut oil
Check the traps 'fore the crawfish boil
Tambourine on a tail of a Labrador
We gon' light the fire
Catch a buzz
Talkin' trash
Just because
No girlfriends to bother us
It's the he man woman haters club
On Hebert Island
Down in Dixie
Jambalaya
And beer and whiskey
City folk
They don't go
'Cause they don't know
How to fais-do-do
Yeah that's for sure
When that storm blows in we headed for the highland
We're from Hebert Island

We're from Hebert Island (Hebert Island)
We're from Hebert Island (Hebert Island)
We're from Hebert Island (Hebert Island)
We're from Hebert Island (Hebert Island)
We're from Hebert Island (Hebert Island)
We're from Hebert Island

We're from Hebert Island
Down in Dixie
Jambalaya
And beer and whiskey
City folk
They don't go
'Cause they don't know
How to fais-do-do
Yeah that's for sure
When that storm blows in we headed for the highland
We're from Hebert Island
