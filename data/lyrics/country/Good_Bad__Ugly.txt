You bring me coffee when I wake up too late
With last night's makeup still painted on my pillowcase
I’m rushin' and scramblin' tryna find my damn keys
You say, "Good God, girl, you’re the prettiest mess I've ever seen," yeah

Good, bad and ugly
Yeah, you still want me
Maybe you're the one that's crazy
For sticking with me, baby
I'm a saint, I'm a sinner, I'm a train wreck
Just about as flawed as they get
But you still love me
Good, bad and ugly
Mm, yeah, good, bad and ugly

How'd I’d get so lucky finding someone so true?
I must’ve done something right in another life to get somebody like you
'Cause you know how to talk me down when I’m on a ledge
I'm glad one of us knows what's going on in my head

Good, bad and ugly
Yeah, you still want me
Maybe you're the one that’s crazy
For sticking with me, baby
I'm a saint, I'm a sinner, I'm a train wreck
Just about as flawed as they get
But you still love me
Good, bad and ugly
The high and the low
You don't let me go
So I won't let you go

Good, bad and ugly
Yeah, you still want me
Maybe you're the one that's crazy
For sticking with me, baby
Good, bad and ugly
Yeah, you still want me
Maybe you're the one that's crazy
For sticking with me, baby
I'm a saint, I'm a sinner, I'm a train wreck
Just about as flawed as they get
But you still love me
Good, bad and ugly
(Good, bad and ugly)
Ooh, yeah, good, bad and ugly
