Between you and me, I've been thinking
'Bout tonight for days yeah
Between you and me, I've been leaning in
And listening to every little thing you say
Got the candles lit, the flowers picked
Got the drinks mixed when you walk in
Baby take a good long look at this shirt
That I'm wearing tonight, 'cause in the blink of an eye
I'm slipping it off, I'm turning you on
I'm dimming the lights, pressing play
On your favorite song
I'm taking you upstairs, laying you down
Where we're making love till the moon's gone
Skin on skin and lips on lips
I'll be kissing away all the space
Between you and me
I don't want a single thing
Not even the bed sheets, no
Between you and me, yeah
I got everything I'll ever need, yeah
Between you and me
'Cause you got everything I want in a woman
And I don't care if I never see
Another black dress on you
But I know I'm going to
And baby when I do
I'm slipping it off, I'm turning you on
I'm dimming the lights, pressing play
On your favorite song
I'm taking you upstairs, laying you down
Where we're making love till the moon's gone
Skin on skin and lips on lips
I'll be kissing away all the space
Between you and me
I don't want a single thing
Not even the bed sheets, no
Between you and me, yeah
I'm slipping it off and turning you on
Dimming the lights, pressing play
On your favorite song
I'm taking you upstairs, laying you down
Where we're making love till the moon's gone
Skin on skin and lips on lips
I'll be kissing away all the space
Between you and me
I don't want a single thing
Not even the bed sheets, no
Between you and me, mmh
Between you and me, yeah
