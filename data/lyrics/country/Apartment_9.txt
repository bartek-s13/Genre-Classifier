Just follow the stairway
To this lonely world of mine
You'll find me waitin' here
In apartment number 9
Not so very long ago
You walked away from me
And after the all the plans we made
You decided to be free
Loneliness surrounds me
Without your arms around me
And the sun will never shine
In apartment number 9
I keep waiting in this lonely room
Just in case you change your mind
You'll find me waitin' here
In apartment number 9
Loneliness surrounds me
Without your arms around me
And the sun will never shine
In apartment number 9
No the sun will never shine in apartment number 9
