If you ain't a man with a lot of guts, a dog-gone woman will drive you nuts*
You can't trust one to the corner now a day
You gotta watch your doors or she'll cheat you blind, a woman ain't got but a one track mind
You'll find out Bud, it's the man who always pays
She'll feed you a line that will turn your head and you'll marry her and when you're in bed
She'll go through all the pockets in your pants
And if you object there'll be a big fight and chances are it will last all night
I'm telling you man you just ain't got a chance
Never, never trust a woman you'll be sorry if you do
Never, never trust a woman she'll just make a monkey out of you
Though women are handy around the house, they can't be trusted by man nor mouse
It's a shame the way they drag a good man down
It's a well-known fact they talk too much and they dig up dirt about the neighbors and such
And Paul Revere the gossip all around town
You'll blow your top when they get in your hair and they'll drive you to drink and man I'll swear
You wish you never seen the light of day
I'm tipping you off your goose is cooked when one of them females get you hooked
And so you better think it over while you may
Never, never trust a woman you'll be sorry if you do
Never, never trust a woman she'll just make a monkey out of you
I'm telling you man it's a dirty shame to come home late from a poker game
To a little wife that's gonna give you heck
She's sitting alone with a rolling pin and will let you have it when you walk in
And when she gets through with you, you'll be a wreck
If you had a little nip and she smelled your breath she'll start in nagging you half to death
And Bud you'll have to put up with that for life
Cause the preacher said for better or worse and until you ride that big black hoarse
You just naturally got yourself a wife
Never, never trust a woman you'll be sorry if you do
Never, never trust a woman she'll just make a monkey out of you
