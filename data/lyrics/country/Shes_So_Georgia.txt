She can bait her own hook, start her own fire
Tall, tanned legs taller than the pines
Her hairs tangled up like a barbed wire fence
But she cleans up nice when she's out with her friends
If you can tell where shes from and where she's been

She's got red clay running through her veins
She's a homegrown peach, she don't ever change
She's a backwoods southern belle, hometown hottie
She's the queen of the South
She's country strong, standing tall, Dixieland outlaw
You know what I'm talking about
Yeah, she's everything that's good for yah
She's so Georgia

She rides those trails what she loves to do
Loves the good Lord and her family too
Eyes that shine like the football lights
Screaming “Go Dogs” on a Saturday night
Yea she knows just what I like

She's got red clay running through her veins
She's a homegrown peach, she don't ever change
She's a backwoods southern belle, hometown hottie
She's the queen of the South
She's country strong, standing tall, Dixieland outlaw
You know what I'm talking about
Yeah, she's everything that's good for yah
Yeah, she's so Georgia
From the swamps to Atlanta
From the mountains down to Savannah
Her roots are deep in this Georgia ground
The kind of girl you’ll find down south

She's got red clay running through her veins
She's a homegrown peach, she don't ever change
She's a backwoods southern belle, hometown hottie
She's the queen of the South
She's country strong, standing tall, Dixieland outlaw
You know what I'm talking about
Yeah, she's everything that's good for yah
I say, she's everything that's good for yah
Yeah she's so Georgia

Ohh, yeah, she's my kind of girl yeah
Yeah, she's so Georgia, haha
