I back down that faded black asphalt
Every mornin' at half past eight
I roll my truck up the interstate drivin'
To a job I know I hate

But I'm still there
Standin' in the kitchen
Thinking 'bout that kiss goodbye
And it ain't fair
'Cause I don't wanna miss it
Gonna finish what we started tonight

'Cause when the lights go down
Gonna shut the world out
Be the only two people in it
I'll turn the radio low
Love you good, love you slow
And I promise you I won't forget it
Baby when the lights go down
Baby when the lights go down

I go back sometimes to the weekend
That we spend in Panama City
Yeah, we got rained out walkin' down the beach
Oh but damn, you sill look pretty
But here we are
Flying through the moments
Livin' our crazy lives
You still got my heart
And I know you know it
But let me show it to you tonight, Tonightt

When the lights go down
Gonna shut the world out
Be the only two people in it
I'll turn the radio low
Love you good, love you slow
And I promise you I won't forget it
Baby when the lights go down
Baby when the lights go down
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Girl the only thing I'm thinking 'bout right now

Is when the lights go down
When the lights go down
When the lights go down
Gonna shut the world out
Be the only two people in it
I'll turn the radio low
Love you good, love you slow
And I promise you I won't forget it
Baby when the lights go down
Baby when the lights go down
Baby when the lights go down
Baby when the lights go down
