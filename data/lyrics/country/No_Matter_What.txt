There was a time way on back
I thought I had my whole life figured out
If anybody asked
I made up my mind, yeah, I swore
That I'd never be tied down
But now, I've never been more sure about

You, girl, it's true
When I said I do, I do

No matter what life brings
No matter how much time that we got left, we got this
No matter what the world sends our way
Girl, you know we're gonna be okay
No matter where you go, I go, backroads or highways
We're gon' take the long way home
Yeah, girl, you know you won't be alone
No matter what

Still can't believe we're here tonight
Feeling what we're feeling, looking down on Cloud 9
Flying high, so high
So let me pull you close and kiss you, girl
Send shivers down your spine
It's all gonna be alright
No matter what life brings
No matter how much time that we got left, we got this
No matter what the world sends our way
Girl, you know we're gonna be okay
No matter where you go, I go, backroads or highways
We're gon' take the long way home
Yeah, girl, you know you won't be alone
(No matter what)

So from this day on (No matter what)
Until kingdom come (No matter what)
I'm gonna love you, girl
No matter what your dad thinks of me
No matter what you like on TV
No matter what side of the bed you wake up on
I'm gonna love ya, oh

You, girl, it's true
When I say I do, I do

No matter what life brings
No matter how much time that we got left, we got this
No matter what the world sends our way
Girl, you know we're gonna be okay
No matter where you go, I go, backroads or highways
We're gon' take the long way home
Yeah, girl, you know you won't be alone
No matter what
So from this day on (No matter what)
Until kingdom come (No matter what)
I'm gonna love you, girl
I'm gonna love you, baby, all night long
So from this day on (No matter what)
Until kingdom come (No matter what)
I'm gonna love you, girl (No matter what)
No matter what
