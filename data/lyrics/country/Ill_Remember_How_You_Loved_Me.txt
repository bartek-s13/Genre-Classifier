I probably won稚 recall Graduation Day
Or the neighbors up the street in the town where I was raised
The Fox and Jacobs houses all dressed up like young cadets
I will forget
It値l slip my memory who was President that year
Like bells on a drugstore door, some things just disappear
When I知 sure that I knew exactly how the story went
I will forget
辰ause when the details turn to dust
And the words get worn and frayed
And the past is trapped in photographs
探il our last days
I値l remember how you
I値l remember how you
I値l remember how you loved me
Funny how time erases memories over time
But the feeling lays around in the walls of your mind
Like a secret that I keep in a box under the bed
I won稚 forget
辰ause when the details turn to dust
And the words get worn and frayed
And the past is trapped in photographs
探il our last days
I値l remember how you
I値l remember how you
I値l remember how you loved me
I値l remember how you
I値l remember how you
I値l remember how you loved
Oh I値l remember how you
I値l remember how you
I値l remember how you loved me
I値l remember how you loved me
