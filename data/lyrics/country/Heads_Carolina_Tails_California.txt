Baby, what do you say we just get lost?
Leave this one horse town like two rebels without a cause
I've got people in Boston, ain't your Daddy still in Des Moines?
We can pack up tomorrow, tonight let's flip a coin

Heads Carolina, tails California
Somewhere greener, somewhere warmer
Up in the mountains, down by the ocean
Where, it don't matter as long as we're going
Somewhere together, I've got a quarter
Heads Carolina, tails California

We can load what we own in the back of a U-Haul van
Couple of modern day Moses' searching for the promised land
We can go four hundred miles before we stop for gas
We can drive for a day and then we'll take a look at the map

Heads Carolina, tails California
Somewhere greener, somewhere warmer
Up in the mountains, down by the ocean
Where, it don't matter as long as we're going
Somewhere together, I've got a quarter
Heads Carolina, tails California

We're gonna get outta here
If we have to ride a Greyhound bus
Boy, we're bound to outrun
The bad luck that's been tailing us

Heads Carolina, tails California
Somewhere greener, somewhere warmer
Up in the mountains, down by the ocean
Where, it don't matter as long as we're going
Somewhere together, I've got a quarter
Heads Carolina, tails California
Ohh California, Carolina, California
