Heart shaped smoke rings
Dancing off the end of your lips
Sneaking out the
Back of your throat
And coming out
Between your fingertips
All I can think about
Is all I can think about
And I keep thinking 'bout it
Thinking 'bout it
I wanna be a cigarette
Smoking on so cool
Or maybe that red wine
You're drinking down so smooth
I wanna be the fire
That's taking you higher
Girl you can leave me
Or let me burn
I wanna be your cigarette
Cigarette
A big bad barfly
Slidding up beside your hips
Trying to get close to you
Just take another drag
Take another sip
All I can think about
Is all I can think about
And I keep thinking 'bout it
Thinking 'bout it
I wanna be a cigarette
Smoking on so cool
Or maybe that red wine
You're drinking down so smooth
(So smooth)
I wanna be the fire
That's taking you higher
Girl you can leave me
Or let me burn
I wanna be your cigarette
Cigarette
I don't wanna your number
I don't want your name girl
I don't wanna waste your time
I don't want your heart girl
I could only break it
I don't wanna wreck your mind
I wanna be a cigarette
(Cigarette)
Smoking on so cool
Or maybe that red wine
(Red wine)
You're drinking down so smooth
(So smooth)
I wanna be the fire
That's taking you higher
Girl you can leave me
Or let me burn
I wanna be your cigarette
Cigarette
Oooo, I wanna be your cigarette
Ooooo, I wanna be your cigarette
I wanna be your cigarette
Cigarette
