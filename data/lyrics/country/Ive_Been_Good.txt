I know it's bound to happen
Grocery store, coffee shop
I'll catch your eye when we're in line
We'll stumble through small talk
And I'll be happy for ya
When you say you're doin' fine
When you ask I'll tell you I've been good
And it won't be a lie

I've been good at drinkin' whiskey
Hell, I practice all the time
I've been good at stayin' busy
Stayin' up all night, yeah
Lord knows I've been good at doin' everything and anything to keep from gettin' over you
Like I know I should
I've been good at lookin' people in the eye
And sayin' I've been good

The truth is I've been hurtin', but I won't ever let you know
I just keep goin' through the motions and never let it show
But these days I have to be careful and not let it go too far
'Cause when I say that I've been good that's just how that sentence starts

'cause I've been good at drinkin' whiskey
Hell, I practice all the time
I've been good at stayin' busy
Stayin' up all night, yeah
Lord knows I've been good at doin' everything and anything to keep from gettin' over you
Like I know I should
I've been good at lookin' people in the eye
And sayin' I've been good

I've been good at drinkin' whiskey
Hell, I practice all the time
I've been good at stayin' busy
Stayin' up all night, yeah
Lord knows I've been good at doin' everything and anything to keep from gettin' over you
Like I know I should
I've been good at lookin' people in the eye
And sayin' I've been good
I've been good
