Trying to live and love with a heart that can't be broken
Is like trying to see the light with eyes that can't be opened
Yeah, we both carry baggage we picked up on our way
So if you love me, do it gently and I will do the same

We may shine, we may shatter, we may be picking up the pieces here on after
We are fragile, we are human, we are shaped by the light we let through us
We break fast, 'cause we are glass, 'cause we are glass

I'll let you look inside me, through the stains and through the cracks
And in the darkness of this moment you see the good and bad
But try not to judge me 'cause we've walked down different paths
But it brought us here together
So I won't take that back

We may shine, we may shatter, we may be picking up the pieces here on after
We are fragile, we are human, we are shaped by the light we let through us
We break fast, 'cause we are glass

We might be oil and water, this could be a big mistake
We might burn like gasoline and fire, it's a chance we'll have to take
We may shine, we may shatter, we may be picking up the pieces here on after
We are fragile, we are human and we are shaped by the light we let through us
We break fast, 'cause we are glass, we are glass
