She can put her shoes under my bed anytime
Matter of fact she can move right into my life and stay
We became buddies a long time ago
So I'm gonna tell something I think you should know
Now you don't recognize what's right before your eyes
The best you ever had you're gonna blow
You've got a girl that loves you she could never be untrue
And buddy let me say that's more than I can say for you
If givin' her some happiness is messing up your plans
I'd be more than happy to take her off your hands
I mean that she can put her shoes under my bed anytime
Anytime she's ready, mmm, it'll be okay
And she can have the key to my door anytime
And she can move right into my life and stay
Now you don't have to listen, just keep doing what you do
She's only one more hurt away, boy, from walking out on you
But if you want to keep her, one thing you better know
Once she gets to walking, she won't have far to go
You know that she can put her shoes under my bed anytime
Anytime that woman's ready, mmm, it's more than okay
And she can have the key to my door anytime
And she can move right into my house and stay
She can put her shoes under my bed anytime
Anytime she's ready well that'll be okay
And she can have the key to my ..... fade....
