High above these canyon walls
The solitary traveler calls
Drifting on the winds of chain
Defying everything
He and I, we are the same
Searching for another game
Cashing in and moving on
Spirits on the wind
We are solitary travelers
Our fortunes come and go
Lady, that's the only love
Our kind will ever know
Chasing shadows 'cross the sand
Emperor of no man's land
Roams the sky with power and grace
And sings for only me
He and I, we understand
The power of the winning hand
In a place where having heart and soul
Can cost you everything
We are solitary travelers
Our fortunes come and go
Lady, that's the only love
Our kind will ever know (x2)
Someday, when it's said and done
We will fly into that setting sun
Taking only heart and soul
Leaving only memory
'Till that day we live to fly
We will make our own way, he and I
Searching for another game
We will roam, forever free
We are solitary travelers
Our fortunes come and go
Lady, that's the only love
Our kind will ever know (x2)
Lady, that's the only love
Our kind will ever know
