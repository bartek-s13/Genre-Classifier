I'm a bad man
James Dean, kinda Steve McQueen
Straight out the badlands
I rolled in and rained down
Like a storm cloud or a heat wave
Made you stay undercover where it's safe
Don't give a damn about the plans you made
We're staying in the bed all day

Cause I'm selfish
Restless like a river, can't help it
I'm taking what you give me but I still want more
I still want more
Cause I'm selfish
Yeah I'm selfish, I'm selfish for you

Have you seen yourself in a full-length mirror
Spinning around lately
I'd lie, cheat, and steal
Feel the sweet scent overtake me
But the Lord sent an angel to save me
So he can't blame me
When my hands get a mind of their own
Girl, if they get ahold of you, I ain't never letting go

Cause I'm selfish
Restless like a river, can't help it
I'm taking what you give me but I still want more
I still want more
Cause I'm selfish
Yeah I'm selfish, I'm selfish for you

Oh, so selfish for you
I still want more
I still want more
I still want more
I still want more

Cause I'm selfish
Restless like a river, can't help it
I'm taking what you give me but I still want more
I still want more
Cause I'm selfish
Yeah I'm selfish, I'm selfish for you

Still want more
I still want more
I still want more
I still want more
I'm selfish for you
