Good mornin' Captain
Good mornin' Shine
Do you need another mule skinner
Out on your new mud line?

Yo-del-lay-ee-ee, yo-del-lay-ee-ee-ee

I like to work
I'm rolling all the time
I can carve my initials
On a mule's behind

Yo-del-lay-ee-ee, yo-del-lay-ee-ee
Yo-lay-ee, yo-lay-ee, yo-del-lay-ee

Hey, little water boy
Bring that water round
If you don't like your job
Set that water bucket down

Yo-del-lay-ee-oo-dee-ee-ee
Yo-dee-yo-del-lay-ee-oo-del-ee-ee
Yo-del-lay-ee-ee, yo-lay-ee-ee
Dee-yo-del-lay-ee-ee-oo-ee-ee
Workin' on the good roads
Dollar and half a day
My good gal's waiting on Saturday night
Just to draw my pay

I'm going to town, honey
What you want me to bring you back?
Bring a pint of booze
And a John B. Stetson hat, bring it comin' honey

Dee-yo-del-lay-ee-ee-ee
Dee-yo-del-ee-oh-del-ee-yo-del-ee-ee
Dee-yo-del-lay-ee-ee, dee-yo-lay-ee-ee
Yo-lay-ee-ee-lay-ee

I smell your bread a burnin'
Turn your damper down
If you ain't got a damper
Good gal, turn your bread around

Dee-yo-del-lay-ee, dee-yo-del-lay-ee
Dee-yo-del-lay-ee-ee-lay-ee
