Some people spend their whole lives dreaming
Talking about them things they'll never do
Spending all them same old stories
Like it's gonna make 'em come true

From the second I first saw you
I knew I'd never be that way
This old town just never changes
I've gotta get away

Oh, tonight
Leaving nothing on the table
Live every moment while we're able
Letting nothing pass us by
Oh, tonight
No regrets, no looking back
No, we ain't got time for that
Cause the best days of our lives start tonight

Some folks keep living in the moment
Like it just happened yesterday
Hanging on hail marys, an almost perfect place
Thinking that he might still save the game

You can spend your whole life wondering
What went wrong, and what went right
Or we can fire up our engines
Leave it all behind

Oh, tonight
Leaving nothing on the table
Live every moment while we're able
Letting nothing pass us by
Oh, tonight
No regrets, no looking back
No, we ain't got time for that
Cause the best days of our lives start tonight

You can spend your whole life wondering
What went wrong, and what went right
Or we can fire up our engines
Leave it all behind

Oh, tonight
Leaving nothing on the table
Live every minute while we're able
Letting nothing pass us by
Oh, tonight
No regrets, no looking back
No, we ain't got time for that
Let tomorrow come tomorrow
And the past stay in the past
The best days of our lives, start tonight

The best days of our lives, start tonight
The best days of our lives, start tonight
Start tonight, start tonight
The best days of our lives, start tonight
