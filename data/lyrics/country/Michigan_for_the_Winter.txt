I need a change of scene 'til the seasons change
Maybe longer nights, maybe shorter days
Will get me over what I can't get past
If you're gone and you won't come back
Maybe a little space or a little time
Somewhere far from here will get you off my mind
I can't stay watching you move on all February long

I'm going to Michigan for the winter
Between the dark and the light of the sky and the snow
Most people go south for the weather
Instead of hiding out in the cold, but

Just in case you wanna change your mind
I'm lettin' you know where you can find me
46th Street, that first right turn
Down a dirt road watching that wood stove burn
I'm either waiting out your memory
Or for you don't wanna come back to me
Whichever comes first until it don't hurt no more
I'll be up North
I'm going to Michigan for the winter
I'm going to Michigan
This seven-hour long empty rear-view drive
Isn't what I want, but I guess it's time
To say goodbye to the way things were
I've finally come to terms, but

Just in case you wanna change your mind
I'm lettin' you know where you can find me
46th Street, that first right turn
Down a dirt road watching that wood stove burn
I'm either waiting out your memory
Or for you don't wanna come back to me
Whichever comes first until it don't hurt no more
I'll be up North
I'm going to Michigan for the winter
Ooh, yeah

I'm going to Michigan for the winter
'Tween the dark and the light of the sky and the snow
Most people go south for the weather
But I just wanna be alone

Just in case you wanna change your mind
I'm lettin' you know where you can find me
46th Street, that first right turn
Down a dirt road watching that wood stove burn
While I'm waiting out your memory
Girl, the only place that I'm supposed to be
Is sittin' in a chair with a Bible or a beer
'Til my heart don't hurt no more
I'm going to Michigan for the winter
Yeah, I'm going to Michigan for the winter
