I don't ever wanna see another sunrise Sunday without you
I don't wanna save a last call dance for no one else
Don't wanna face another wasted minute
Thinking 'bout a day without you in it
If there's one thing I'm sure of
Baby I'm sure as hell

I don't need no other girl
'Cause when it's right, it's right
Yeah you know, when you know
And I knew when you changed my life
Overnight
You're my saving grace
More than worth the wait
My one in six billion love in this crazy world
Now that we got each other, girl
I don't need no other girl

All I know is that you drink mimosas when you're hungover
And that your singin' in the shower song is ''Dancing Queen''
You grew up in East Carolina
Took me a few broken hearts to find ya
But the thing I know most is you're my everything

I don't need no other girl
'Cause when it's right, it's right
Yeah you know, when you know
And I knew when you changed my life
Overnight
You're my saving grace
More than worth the wait
My one in six billion love in this crazy world
Now that we got each other, girl
I don't need no other girl

I can see forever
When you're looking at me
(Lookin' at me)
I hate saying ''never''
But I'll never need no

Other girl
'Cause when it's right, it's right
Yeah you know, when you know
And I knew when you changed my life
Overnight
You're my saving grace
More than worth the wait
My one in six billion love in this crazy world
Now that we got each other, girl
I don't need no other girl

(I don't need no other girl)
I don't need no other girl
No, I don't need no other girl
