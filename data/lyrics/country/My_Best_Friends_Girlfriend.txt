We've been friends since we were five
Same team on the same side
People said we were just like brothers
You had my back through thick and thin
I said I'd take a bullet for him
We always shared everything with each other

My best friend's got a brand new girlfriend
She's in his arms but she's in my dreams tonight
My best friend's got a brand new girlfriend
I wish, I wish, I wish I didn't wish she was mine
I-I-I didn't wish she was mine, no

She's lookin' at me lookin' at her
Is that just a smile what is she after
This is lookin' like a disaster about to happen
I'd be up a girl but down a friend
That's the kind of math that in the end
Leaves three hearts broken, zero satisfaction

My best friend's got a brand new girlfriend
She's in his arms but she's in my dreams tonight
My best friend's got a brand new girlfriend
I wish, I wish, I wish I didn't wish she was mine
I-I-I didn't wish she was mine, no
She's so cool
Layin' out by the pool
She's so hot
She's everything I ain't got
Everything I ain't got, got, got, got, got, got, got, got

My best friend's got a brand new girlfriend
She's in his arms but she's in my dreams tonight
My best friend's got a brand new girlfriend
I wish, I wish, I wish I didn't wish yeah
I wish, I wish, I wish I didn't wish yeah
I wish, I wish, I wish I didn't wish she was mine
I-I-I didn't wish she was mine, no
Ha-ha I kinda wish she was mine
I wish, I wish, I wish I didn't wish yeah
