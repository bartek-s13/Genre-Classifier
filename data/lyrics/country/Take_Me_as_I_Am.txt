Straight out of a rolling stone magazine
A blue jean baby
My America dream
You're a Hollywood smile
Flying so high out of my league
Well I'm a little reckless
Yeah but you're the one for me

So take me as I am
Woah everybody knows
This life yeah is a crazy road
Well hallelujah bless your soul
Take me as I am
Woah and don't let go

Now you were built for speed
Better take it slow
Well you're sunshine
And I'm neon glow
Well darling we weren't meant
To walk this world alone
And right here in my arms is where you belong

So take me as I am
Woah everybody knows
This life yeah is a crazy road
Well hallelujah bless your soul
Take me as I am
Woah and don't let go

That's right
Don't let go no
Oh baby baby baby

Take me as I am
Take me as I am
Take me as I am
Take me as I am
Take me as I am
Woah everybody knows
This life yeah is a crazy road
Well hallelujah well bless your soul
Take me as I am
Woah and don't let go
Take me as I am
