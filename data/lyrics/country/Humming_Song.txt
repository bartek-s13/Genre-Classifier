She's got your favorite voice
If you had a choice you'd hear it everyday
Let's pretend I don't know it's true
So when you're not around
I sit down trying to soothe myself
My humming tune I know make you boo
Hoow hooow ho how how

You're tired of looking at me
You think she's gotta be the prettiest thing in town
But you see her with all the makeup on
You'd like to send her a letter but you know better
So you just flow without
I pick up up and read em when you're not home
Singing

Hoow hooow ho how how
Hoow hooow ho how how
Hoow hooow ho how how
Hoow hooow ho how how
