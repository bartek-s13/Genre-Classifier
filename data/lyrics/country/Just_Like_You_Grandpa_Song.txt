Well I remember when he called me little man
This old friend of mine I never knew I had was my granddad
Hey that old man in the corner ain't so tough
He'd stand so quiet, never showin' what it was that he was made of
He said that all good things must have an end
He said, "Someday we might all meet again in heaven"
"Well I've got everything I need"
That's what my grandpa said to me
I said, "Someday I'll have all that too"
Then you'll see I wanna be just like you
Oh I wanna be just like you
It wasn't so long ago, we were out there on the road
This old man and me, we'd take our troubles to the sea, fulfill our dreams
Now he'd walk slowly through all the dreams he knew
He'd tell me stories of everyone great he knew
They were just like you
He said that all good things must have an end
He said, "Someday we might all meet again in heaven"
"Well I've got everything I need"
That's what my grandpa said to me
I said, "Someday I'll have all that too, and you'll see"
I wanna be just like you
I wanna be just like you
"Well I've got everything I need"
That's what my grandpa said to me
I said, "Someday I'll have all that too, and then you'll see"
I wanna be just like you
I wanna be just like you
Hey there Grandpa, just like you
I wanna be just like you
