More money than Wall Street
Got more game than Kobe in his heyday
Easy going like a lazy river flowing to the ocean
Got a wave of emotion coming over me
Out of touch with reality
This getting-over-you-getting-over-me

Is driving me crazy
Still drunk on loving you, baby
Rain clouds are over me lately
And I could sure use a little you right now
I'm still waiting
Trying to figure it out
Thinking maybe I could turn it around
And I could be the one you think about
Oh I'm, still-still-still crazy
Still-still-still crazy

More thriller than M.J
More hip than the hip-hop coming from Drake
The way you move sets the mood like the groove on vinyl
It's no wonder why...

I'm still crazy
Still drunk on loving you, baby
Rain clouds are over me lately
And I could sure use a little you right now
I'm still waiting
Trying to figure it out
Thinking maybe I could turn it around
And I could be the one you think about
Oh I'm, still-still-still crazy
Still-still-still crazy

Lock me up, throw away the key
This getting-over-you-getting-over-me

Is driving me crazy
Still drunk on loving you, baby
Rain clouds are over me lately
And I could sure use a little you right now
I'm still waiting
Trying to figure it out
Thinking maybe I could turn it around
And I could be the one you think about
Oh I'm, still-still-still crazy
Still-still-still crazy
Still-still-still crazy
