I feel love anytime that you're around
But when I'm gone it don't take much to bring me down
Till I'm home I'll be true as I can be
Don't you know only one love pleases me
It takes you and no other lovin' will do
It takes you I don't love nobody but you
My one only (it takes you) when I'm lonely (it takes you)
It takes you
Don't you know you mean more than life to me
We've got love and that's all we'll ever need
Please believe you're the only one for me
Hold me close and I'll put your mind at ease
It takes you and no other lovin' will do...
