Daylight or midnight
Red eyes and that old hat
Whiskey-bent and busted flat
She's a credit to her flaws
She's a bad risk, but a good friend
Small change and loose ends
She only regrets that she might've been
A little faster on the draw

Those old high ridin' heroes
They're anywhere the wind blows
She's been to hell and Texas
And she knows how it feels
To be ridin' that hot streak
And drunk on some back street
Falling off the wagon
And under the wheels

Time was when she was queen
Now the rodeo's just this old girl's dream
The highs are few and far between
The lows get the rest
These old hard times ain't nothin' new
Once you've done the best you can do
You just tip your hat to the wild and blue
And you ride off to the west

Those old high ridin' heroes
They're anywhere the wind blows
She's been to hell and Texas
And she knows how it feels
To be ridin' that hot streak
And drunk on some back street
Falling off the wagon
And under the wheels


Those old high ridin' heroes
They're anywhere the wind blows
She's been to hell and Texas
And she knows how it feels
To be ridin' that hot streak
And drunk on some back street
Falling off the wagon
And under the wheels
