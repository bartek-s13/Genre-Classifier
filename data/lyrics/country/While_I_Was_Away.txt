By the time I made it home
You were already in bed
Chubby cheek pressed to your pillow
By a bedtime book you'd read
And I noticed that you looked older
Than you did yesterday
You've been growin' up
While I was away
You made a pile of leaves in the front yard
I guess it's already fall
By the look of those pictures your momma took
The two of you had a ball
And it made me glad but a little sad
To see those games you play
I missed a lot of smiles
While I was away
And for every dollar I earn there's a lesson you learn without me there
And every day I'm on the go I'm prayin' that you know your daddy cared
'Cause the hardest part about workin' hard ain't the bills I gotta pay
It's you growin' up while I was away
And I found your note in the kitchen
It's a real work of art
A stickman holding your stick hand with "Daddy" written in a heart
And it got me good 'cause I understood
Just what you meant to say
You've been missin' me too
While I was away
And for every dollar I earn there's a lesson you learn without me there
And every day I'm on the go I'm prayin' that you know your daddy cared
'Cause the hardest part about workin' hard ain't the bills I gotta pay
It's you growin' up while I was away
You know the hardest part about workin' hard
Ain't the bills I gotta pay
It's everything I missed
While I was away
