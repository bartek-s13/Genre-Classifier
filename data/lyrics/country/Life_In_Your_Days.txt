Ferris wheel lit up like a roman candle
County fair on the square like a movie scene
She had her raspberry lips kissin' on a candy apple
She had me wrapped around her finger like a promise ring

Falling like the leaves in late September
Walked the whole way home with her hand in mine
Yes, there were fireworks in the night air I remember
There were fireworks in the first long kiss goodnight

Yeah the days in your life
They'll fly by if you let 'em
So go and get 'em, don't you let 'em get away
Yeah go on and raise one up high
Chase that moon, paint that sky
You might as well raise some hell along the way
'Cause it ain't the days in your life
It's the life in your days

Clear blue water in a white rock quarry
45 feet high, scared to death
We all thought, someday this would make a damn good story
So we all got just buzzed enough and jumped off the edge

Yeah the days in your life
They'll fly by if you let 'em
So go and get 'em, don't you let 'em get away
Yeah go on and raise one up high
Chase that moon, paint that sky
You might as well raise some hell along the way
'Cause it ain't the days in your life
It's the life in your days

Yeah the days in your life
They'll fly by if you let 'em
So go and get 'em, don't you let 'em get away
Yeah go on and raise one up high
Chase that moon, paint that sky
You might as well raise some hell along the way
'Cause it ain't the days in your life
No, it ain't the days in your life
No, it ain't the days in your life
It's the life in your days
Hmm-hmmmm, life in your days
