The first thing I did when you said goodbye
Was sit myself down and have a real good cry
The next thing I did was put my red dress on
And went downtown dancin' till the break of dawn

A girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do
And now I gotta get to getting' over you
Too bad I gotta do it with someone new
But a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do

Fancy meetin' you at our stompin' ground
Sorry if you caught me paintin' the town
Guess I shoulda stayed home with your memory
Well, baby don't take it personally

A girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do
And now I gotta get to getting' over you
Too bad I gotta do it with someone new
But a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do
Gimme a call some time real soon
And remind me to remember to forget about you
