Two drinks in on a Friday night
Heard a knock at the door
Someone turned on the light
And I said "baby
What you doing outside with that 2am
Kinda drunk, kinda smile?"

Every word that you say
Sounds like you missed me
Every move that you make
Says you wanna kiss me
And you whisper "baby
Can I hang here for a while?"

Well come on in, the whiskey's fine
It ain’t even close, to closin' time
So if you wanna taste that Tennessee
Well, pour on out a drink with me
And put your lips on mine
Come on in, the whiskey's fine

You’re pushin' me up, against the wall
Leavin' a trail of clothes and our sorrows down the hall
Yeah you're leaving your mark
With that lipstick red
And we're fallin' back into this bed
Well come on in, the whiskey's fine
It ain't even close, to closin’ time
So if you wanna taste that Tennessee
Well, pour on out a drink with me
And put your lips on mine
Come on in, yeah, the whiskey’s fine

I got a bottle opened up
And I wanna feel the rush
'Cause I need that you-and-me buzz

So come on in, the whiskey’s fine
It ain't even close, to closin' time
So if you wanna taste that Tennessee
Well, pour on out a drink with me
And put your lips on mine
Come on in, yeah, the whiskey's fine
Oh yeah
Come on in, the whiskey’s fine
