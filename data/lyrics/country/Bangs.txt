In the night, when I'm high and can't fall asleep
I think of you so desperately
Oh bangs, Oh bangs, Oh bangs
Would you believe if I said you're the one for me

And I don't want to come on too strong
But I've waited far, far too long
Oh, if something's gonna give
Then just show me the look of love
Or else I'm giving up

And I can't run around like some kinda fool
And all your friends say you ain't worth it
That you just think ain't that cool
Oh bangs, Oh bangs, Oh bangs
Now I'm alone 'cause you weren't the one for me

But it's June and the summer has come
And brought others to take away the harm
That you left in my chest
I still have dreams about you
It's tough
But I guess I'm giving up

And it's such a shame, it's all my fault, it's true
It's not what I did, it's what I couldn't do
Oh bangs, Oh bangs, Oh bangs
Now I'm alone 'cause you weren't the one for me
