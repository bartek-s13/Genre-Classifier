Red blinking lights pull me in
Standing in line, waiting for a spin
Let my feet leave the ground
Be a building standing tall
Fall in love with the rise and the fall
While I’m waiting at the bottom dreaming of the top
Sometimes I want on it, sometimes I want off
I could stand there watching but I never know how it feels
Riding high on a Ferris wheel
Just when you think you know how it ends
Turns you in circles back to the beginning again
Sometimes what you’re afraid of is what’s going to take you there
And the view is better when it’s all up in the air
While you’re waiting at the bottom dreaming of the top
Sometimes you want on it, sometimes you want off
I could stand there watching but I never know it feels
Riding high on a Ferris wheel
As sure as you go up, you will come down
And if you let go it always comes back around
While you’re waiting at the bottom dreaming of the top
Sometimes you want on it, sometimes you want off
I could stand there watching but I never know it feels
Riding high on a Ferris wheel
Riding high on a Ferris wheel
Red blinking lights pull me in
Standing in line, waiting for a spin
