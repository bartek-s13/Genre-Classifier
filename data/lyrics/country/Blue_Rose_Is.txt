Her lips and her dress, they're both ruby red
She thinks that's how you hide the pain you feel inside
And she comes out every night to soak up the neon light
Her perfume fills the air, people stop and stare, but
Blue Rose is looking for the moon in someone's eyes
Blue Rose is willing to believe someone's lies
Now Blue Rose's petals have been crushed along the way
Oh, Blue Rose is just growing bluer everyday
One more drink, one more dance, you might be her only chance
She needs someone to hold when the night is growing old
And if you don't mind the thorns, she'll take you in and keep you warm
Lying in the dark in a bed of broken hearts, 'cause
Blue Rose is looking for the moon in someone's eyes
Blue Rose is willing to believe someone's lies
Now Blue Rose's petals have been crushed along the way
Oh, Blue Rose is just growing bluer everyday
