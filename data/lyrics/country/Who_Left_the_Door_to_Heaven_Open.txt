WHO LEFT THE DOOR TO HEAVEN OPEN
Writer Betty Duke
Someone must have known that I was lonely
That's why they sent you to me from above
I know someone must have heard me crying
And gave me such an angel that I love
(Chorus)
Who left the door to heaven open
Who turned their head for a moment
Who told you that my heart was broken
And who left the door to heaven open
Heaven just can't be the same without you
I guess you must have been their brightest star
And, tonight, I know the angels all will miss you
But they know just exactly where you are
(Repeat chorus)
