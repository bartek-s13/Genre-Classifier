I知 laughing on the outside, I知 crying on the inside
Trying my best to hide all these tears in my eyes
I知 laughing on the outside but I知 dying on the inside
Baby when you said goodbye, I put my heartache in disguise
Saw my friends on the street
They池e all asking me how I知 taking it
I act like nothing痴 wrong
I don稚 let on, I知 good at faking it
But just how long can I keep up this masquerade?
You know it痴 just a saccharine
I知 laughing on the outside but I知 crying on the inside
Trying my best to hide all the pain I feel inside
I知 laughing on the outside but I知 dying on the inside
Baby when you said goodbye, I put my heartache in disguise
But how does the heartache last?
How much do you pay for love?
How long will I wear this mask?
How long can I keep it up?
Laughing on the outside, crying on the inside
Trying my best to hide all these tears in my eyes
I知 laughing on the outside but I知 dying on the inside
Baby when you said goodbye, I put my heartache in disguise
Saw you with someone last night
Had to fight the jealousy
So I smiled and said hello
Hope it didn稚 show but it was killing me
And just how long can I keep up this masquerade?
You know it痴 just a saccharine
I知 laughing on the outside but I知 crying on the inside
Trying my best to hide all these tears in my eyes
I知 laughing on the outside but I知 dying on the inside
Baby when you said goodbye, I put my heartache in disguise
I知 laughing on the outside but I知 crying on the inside
Trying my best to hide all these tears in my eyes
I知 laughing on the outside but I知 dying on the inside
Baby when...
