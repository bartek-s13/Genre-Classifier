Who knows who she used to be before it all went dark
Was she like a streak of fire, a painted glass, a beating heart?
All the mirrors, all the smoke, she'll read a thousand times
Versions of the third degree; yours and hers and mine

I didn’t know her then
My enemy, my treasured friend
Outside this waking dream
She remembers everything
I don't know her now
My bitter pill, my broken vow
This girl, this bird who sings
She remembers everything

There was a time we looked so fine behind a burning wall
Of larceny and tenderness we had to have it all
Pack up all your troubles now, pack up your new dress
Somewhere there's a quiet room where thieves like us can rest

I didn’t know her then
My enemy, my treasured friend
Outside this waking dream
She remembers everything
I don't know her now
My bitter pill, my broken vow
This girl, this bird who sings
She remembers everything


I didn't know her then
My enemy, my treasured friend
Outside this waking dream
She remembers everything
I don't know her now
My bitter pill, my broken vow
This girl, this bird who sings
She remembers everything
She remembers everything
