Going out every night, don't feel the envy
Cause the thrill always ends when they say last call
And it's not like other girls, they don't wanna know me
Waking up with strangers ain't no fix at all

Cause I'm lonely for you only
Everyday is just a deeper shade of blue
I don't want no other heart to ever hold me
Cause I'm only lonely for you

I jump every time I hear the phone ring
But it's never your voice on the end of the line
And I run to the blinds and look out my window
Hold my breath every time a car drives by

Cause I'm lonely for you only
Everyday is just a deeper shade of blue
And I don't want no other heart to ever hold me
Cause I'm only lonely for you
And I don't want no other heart to ever hold me
Cause I'm only lonely for you

Cause I'm lonely only for you
