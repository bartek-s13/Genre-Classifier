They we say we've got to leave but there's no way to go
This ain't the first time we've weathered out a storm
And I ain't got nothing but at least I know it's mine
And I'll be god damned if I'm leaving here before the day I die

So let the rain sting my neck
Let the mighty Mississippi take this god-forsaken town
Let the storm and all the fury come and carry me away
Take me to that place somewhere on higher ground

The voices on the radio were cracking off and on
The court is underwater and the levees all but gone
There's children in the treetops and soldiers in the sky
It's too late now to run I'd never make it out alive


Everyone sit tight help is on the way
I don't think Jr. is going to last another day
We got a sawed off and a red hot .44
So all you looters best come heavy when you're knocking on my door

(Bridge)
We all know this crescent city just won't be the same again
And I'll still be standing' when the saints go marching in

X's on the windows say there's no one left inside
If you count the painted numbers you'll know just how many died
And I'm one in half a million so at least I'm not alone
The hurricane is over but the storm keeps raging on

So let the rain sting my neck
Let the mighty Mississippi take this god-forsaken town
Let the storm and all the fury come and carry me away
Take me to that place somewhere on higher ground
Take me to that place somewhere on higher ground
