Hey girl since I've met you
It's been a rollercoaster ride
I've been going crazy every time we say goodbye
Even  Aristotle couldn't explain
The way I feels inside
Dream and write a book
Tell the whole world that I am hooked
On your love and irresistibleness
Ain't no girl that I'd rather be with
And it probably won't win no prize
But if I can make you realize
This song is true
It's called lovin' you
Now I'm no writer and I'm no poet
And i dont have a way with words
So all this mushy stuff may sound a little upset
But even my friends and I think I'm losing my mind
About the way I feel inside
Dream and write a book
Tell the whole world that I am hooked
On your love and irresistibleness
Ain't no girl that I'd rather be with
And it probably won't win no prize
But if I can make you realize
This song is true
It's called lovin' you
Dream and write a book
Tell the whole world that I am hooked
On your love and irresistibleness
Ain't no girl that I'd rather be with
And it probably won't win no prize
But if I can make you realize
This song is true
It's called lovin' you
Its called loving you
Its called loving you
