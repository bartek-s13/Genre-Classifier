This situation really sucks
Cover up how you feel
Blame it on your bad luck
When you said your bad luck ain't real
You need to let go
You need to promise yourself one thing
That you'll never let go
That you'll never let this feelin' leave
I've given you time
Given you space
Still can't believe that you'd do me this way
Have you made up your mind
I won't be around for long
And when I dream
All I see is your face
And I wake up to the emptiest place
In this tell it all town
It hurts to pretend
When I am constant on your mind
Fake smiles around fake friends
They tear you down
And then you act surprised
You're all alone
You think the worst things possible
You finally let go
Turn around and smile and say
I've given you time
Given you space
Still can't believe that you'd do me this way
Have you made up your mind
I won't be around for long
And when I dream
All I see is your face
And I wake up to the emptiest place
In this tell it all town
She said I'm this close to leavin'
So be a man and let me know
If you can see myself with someone else
Why'd you let me go
In this tell it all town
Heyyyy
This tell it all town
I've given you time
Given you space
Still can't believe that you'd do me this way
Have you made up your mind
I won't be around for long
And when I dream
All I see is your face
And I wake up to the emptiest place
In this tell it all town
In this tell it all town
The situation really sucks
Cover up how you feel
Blame it on your bad luck
When you said your bad luck ain't real
