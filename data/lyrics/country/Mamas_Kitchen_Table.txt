Just a four by six slab of Georgia pine
Coffee stains cover up the chip in egg shell white
Dad bought it new in 1982 and it ain't left that dinin' room
Since it rolled off that Sears assembly line

It was the start and the end of every day
Hats off, heads down, who's turn is it to pray?
Gather 'round cryin' and laughin'
More than just the biscuits we were passin'
Where I learned the words kids shouldn't say
And ask to be excused before you walk away
And all the life lessons you can't find on no label
They're right there around Mama's kitchen table

It was built for six but there was never less than eight
It's held a lifetimes worth of my homework and homemade birthday cakes
And those cups I used to drink my apple juice had more than once been filled with booze
On the weekends, when my folks went away

It was the start and the end of every day
Hats off, heads down, who's turn is it to pray?
Gather 'round cryin' and laughin'
More than just the biscuits we were passin'
Where I learned the words kids shouldn't say
And ask to be excused before you walk away
And all the life lessons you can't find on no label
They're right there around Mama's kitchen table
Around Mama's kitchen table
Yeah it's where I learned to hold and fold and raise
And how it ain't always about who wins the game
And all the life lessons you can't find on no label
I've had a seat right there since the day I left the cradle
Around Mama's kitchen table
Around Mama's kitchen table
