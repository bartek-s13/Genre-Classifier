I don't know if there's somebody else
Cause we never said nothin' bout nobody else
But for me there ain't nobody else
Cause I fell that hard for you
I don't know if you want what I want
If you're letting me in or you're leading me on
I don't know where this is going
But I know where I want it to

The clock ain't reversing
I light up when you say
"Do you wanna stay the night tonight?"

City girl, you're gonna love me and leave me
Cause it ain't gonna mean what it means to me, to you
When I wake up on your pillow
Start making out a little
Till it's time to say goodbye like you always do
You tell your friends all about it like it's only going out
I'm just another Friday night
Another someone to call
It's such a fine line playing it cool
Not pushing too hard
I'm breaking my own heart
Falling in love with a city girl
Falling in love with a city girl
2AM, hear the buzz of your phone
I don't have to ask cause I already know
That he's just like me, but tonight he's alone
Cause I'm with you
Yeah, I'm with you

Watch that sunrise
Coming through your blinds
Just another hour or two

Yeah, city girl, you're gonna love me and leave me
Cause it ain't gonna mean what it means to me, to you
When I wake up on your pillow
Start making out a little
Till it's time to say goodbye like you always do
You tell your friends all about it like it's only going out
I'm just another Friday night
Another someone to call
It's such a fine line playing it cool
Not pushing too hard
I'm breaking my own heart
Falling in love with a city girl
Falling in love with a city girl
I could take you out for coffee
We could talk about whatever
It don't have to be your heart, girl
We could talk about the weather
Baby, I don't wanna scare you
I'm not tryna' lock you down
I just want your time
And I don't wanna leave right now

City girl, you're gonna love me and leave me
Cause it ain't gonna mean what it means to me, to you
When I wake up on your pillow
Start making out a little
Till it's time to say goodbye like you always do
You tell your friends all about it like it's only going out
I'm just another Friday night
Another someone to call
It's such a fine line playing it cool
Not pushing too hard
I'm breaking my own heart
Falling in love with a city girl
Falling in love with a city girl

Falling in love with a city girl
Falling in love with a city girl
Falling in love with a city girl
Falling in love with a city girl
Falling in love with a city girl
Falling in love with a city girl
