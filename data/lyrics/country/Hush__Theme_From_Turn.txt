There's snakes in the garden
Blood on the vines
Every time I slip away
It feels like a crime

(Hush)
Underneath the shadows
The aching ground
The grey of the moon is all we have now
Soul for sale (hush)
Soul for sale
Soul for sale
Soul for sale

There's ropes in the hallway
Scars in the silver
I know there will come a day
When red runs the river

Keep the light on, keep the light on
I'm waiting
Keep the light on, keep the light on
I'm praying for you
All the silver lining that is hiding the color
(Hush)
Soul for sale (hush)
Soul for sale (hush)
Don't make a sound (*don't make a sound*)
Don't make a sound
Don't make a sound (*don't make a sound*)
Don't make a sound
Soul for sale (hush)

There's snakes in the garden
(Soul for sale)
Blood on the vines
(Hush, hush)
I can't wait anymore
(Soul for sale)
I can't wait anymore
