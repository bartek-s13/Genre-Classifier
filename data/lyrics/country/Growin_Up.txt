Same parking lot party spot on the weekend
After every home game that's where we went
We went twelve and one and one hell of a season
Seventeen and hell bent on leaving
Ain't growing up
Just passed the bar that we all used to sneak in
Just trine find one place to get a drink in
They closed it up and put a dollar tree in
Man, driving round this town, it starts to sink in
It's growin' up

Man, I wish that I could go back now
Stop the clock and take another lap around
If I knew then what I know right now
Life'll get you down, break your heart, mess you up
Yeah man, but that's just part of growing up
Yeah, growing up

Parked down by the lake just like we used to do
You kissing on my neck, my hands all over you
Oh, back before you put an end to me and you
Gave me back that ring and said I need to do
A little growing up, yeah

Man, I wish that I could go back now
Stop the clock and take another lap around
If I knew then what I know right now
Life'll get you down, break your heart, mess you up
Yeah man, but that's just part of growing up
Yeah, growing up


Been minutes since the boys been back together
When you're 21 these cones just taste better
So let's raise 'em up and make a toast to forever
Cheers y'all, it sure has been a pleasure

Man, I wish that I could go back now
Stop the clock and take another lap around
If I knew then what I know right now
Life'll get you down, break your heart, mess you up
Yeah man, but that's just part of growing up
Yeah, growing up
Man, that's just a part of growing up
Yeah, growing up
