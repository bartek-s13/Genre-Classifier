The snowflakes fall as winter comes
And time just seems to fly
Is it the loneliness in me
That makes me want to cry?
My heart is sad like a morning dove
That's lost its mate in flight
Hear the cooing of his lonely heart
Through the stillness of the night
Whispering pines, whispering pines
Tell me is it so
Whispering pines, whispering pines
You're the one who knows
My darlin' is gone, ohh, she's gone
And I need your sympathy
Whispering pines
Send my baby back to me
See that squirrel up in the tree
His mate there on the ground
Hear their barking call of love
For the happiness they've found
Is my love still my love, ohh, this I gotta know
Send the message by the wind
Because I love her so
Whispering pines, whispering pines
Tell me is it so
Whispering pines, whispering pines
You're the one who knows
My darlin' is gone, ohh, she's gone
And I need your sympathy
