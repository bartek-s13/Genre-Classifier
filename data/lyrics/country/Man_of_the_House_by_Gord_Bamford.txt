6 a.m. and Bobby's waking up
Rolls out of bed with sleepy eyes
Gose to his to sisters room across the hall
Hey Daisy, rise and shine
He pours 2 bowls full of of captain crunch
And puts a fresh pot of coffee on
He wakes his mama up off the couch
The bus is here we love you mom
He made the the breakfast, he did the dishes
So she wouldn't have to
Oh, he's only 10,just coming of age
He oughta be out playing ball and vido games
Climbing trees or on a bike,just ridding around
But it's hard to be a kid when your the man of the house
It's late at night and Larry King is on
And mama's up on the couch again
And Bobby hears them all talk about the war his daddy's in
So he runs straight up to his room
Don't wan't his mama to see him right now
He climbs in his bed and saya a silent prayer
Then he cries his little blue eyes out
Don't want to let her down
Oh,he's only 10 just coming of age
He oughta be out playing ball and vido games
Climbing trees or on a bike, just ridding around
But it's hard to be a kid when your the man of the house
It's finally saturday, Bobby gets a phone call
Another world away from home
He says,"I love you dad", daddy says it right back
"wish I could reach through the phone and hug you
And Daisy and your mom, I'm so proud of you son"
Oh, he's only 10 just coming of age
He oughta be out playing ball and vido games
Climbing trees or on a bike,just ridding aroud
But it's hard to be a kid when your the man of the house
6 A.M. and Bobby's waking up
Rolls out of bed with sleepy eyes
