My daddy, never was, a drinkin' man
It didn't matter, whether bottles or cans
He said we all have somethin', that we must believe
And he tried to, instill that in me

Well I believe I'll have me a beer
'Cause it ain't sold in heaven, you gotta buy it right here
And you can't take it with you, whenever you go
So I believe I'll drink all I can hold

Hey that woman just tore me in two
She's just one more reason, I turned to the brew
You see a beers ten times better whenever it's cold
And you can kill it, before it grows old

So I believe I'll have me a beer
'Cause it ain't sold in heaven, you gotta buy it right here
And you can't take it with you, whenever you go
So I believe I'll drink all I can hold

Hey I was goin' a hundred and five
When I looked in my mirror and I saw those blue lights
And the next thing I knew, I was touchin' my nose
And that cops said, Son I hope those are cold
'Cause I believe I'll have me a beer
'Cause it ain't sold in prison, you gotta drink it out here
And you can't take it with you, whenever you go
So I believe I'll drink all I can hold

Naw, you can't take it with you whenever you go
So I believe I'll drink all I can hold
