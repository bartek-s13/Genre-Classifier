I slipped out of the house about sundown
While mama was a washin' her hair
And you can bet your bottom dollar she'll come lookin' for me
When she finds that I'm not there
And if she catches her sweet thang runnin' around
I know there'll be the devil to pay
She'll come blowin' like a cyclone right through that door
And I can hear exactly what she'll say
Well, has anybody here seen sweet thang
I got a notion he'll be headed this a way
'Cause when my sweet thang is out tomcattin' around
He finds a sandbox like this to play
I wanna tell all you barroom roses
If my sweet thang does happen by
You'd better take my advice and if you'll blink more than twice
You'd better have somethin' in your eye
I gave my baby all my money on payday
Except a little she don't know that I got
'Cause there's a cute little waitress at the corner cafe
And she seems to like me quite a lot
While we were sittin' in the back booth a havin' a talk
She's believin' every word that I said
When the door blew open, Loretta walked in
Yellin' loud enough to wake the dead
Well, has anybody here seen sweet thang
I got a notion he'll be headed this a way
'Cause when my sweet thang is out tomcattin' around
He finds a sandbox like this to play
I wanna tell all you barroom roses
If my sweet thang does happen by
You'd better take my advice and if you'll blink more than twice
You'd better have somethin' in your eye
(She ain't kiddin', neither!)
You'd better take my advice and if you'll blink more than twice
You'd better have somethin' in your eye
