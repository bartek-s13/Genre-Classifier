I ain't gone off the deep end
Ain't been runnin' with a bad crowd
I ain't dead in a ditch nowhere
Just tryin' to figure things out
Takin' me a heartbreak

She hit me like a Mack truck
When she done me how she did me
Might as well have doused my in diesel
Struck a match and just lit me
I'm takin' me a heartbreak
Yeah, I'm takin' me a heartbreak

This heart can take a beating
Tough as nails, it's used to being hammered on
But this time it's split in half
It's takin' everything I have to be strong
So I'm takin' me a heartbreak

I might go back home to Mama
I might drive across the country
In my old truck just takin' me a heartbreak
I might take a little time to heal
Hell, I've got a little time to kill
Well, damn my luck, I'm takin' me a heartbreak

This heart can take a beating
Tough as nails, it's used to being hammered on
But this time it's split in half
It's takin' everything I have to be strong
Yeah, so I'm takin' me a heartbreak
I'm just takin' me a heartbreak
Yeah, I'm takin' me a heartbreak

Well, this heart can take a beating
Tough as nails, it's used to being hammered on
But this time it's split in half
It's takin' everything I have to be strong
So I'm takin' me a heartbreak
Just takin' me a heartbreak

I ain't gone off the deep end
Ain't been runnin' with a bad crowd
I ain't dead in a ditch nowhere
Just tryin' to figure things out
