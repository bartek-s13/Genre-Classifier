ONE A.M., I GET A TEXT
STARTS WITH THE WORDS I THINK IT'S THE BEST
AND ENDS WITH THE WORDS I'M SORRY
YA COULDN'T EVEN DO IT FACE TO FACE
BUT ME LIKE A MILLION RAZOR BLADES
AND YOU MOVED ON WITHOUT A SINGLE WORRY
BUT NOW I HEAR YOU BEEN CRYIN' CROCODILE TEARS
BEEN LYIN', PRETENDIN' THAT YOU'RE DYIN' OF A BROKEN HEART
OH
YOU DON'T GET TO HURT LIKE ME
YOU DON'T GET TO GET SYMPATHY
YOU DON'T GET TO ACT LIKE
I WALKED OUT THE DOOR
YOU DON'T GET TO SPREAD THE BLAME
YOU DON'T GET TO SHARE MY PAIN
YOU DON'T GET TO FAKE IT, FAKE IT ANYMORE
IT'S MY HEARTACHE, NOT YOURS
IT'S MY HEARTACHE, NOT YOURS
WHY DON'T YOU ADMIT THE TRUTH
TELL EVERYBODY THAT IT'S ALL ON YOU
AND THAT I DIDN'T WANNA END IT
I LOVE YOU AND YOU KNOW IT
NEVER DO ANYTHING TO BLOW IT
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO HAD TO GO AND
THROW IT ALL AWAY
OH

(CHORUS)

YOU CAN PITCH A FIT
YOU CAN THROW STONES
FIND SOMEBODY ELSE BUT LEAVE ME ALONE
MOVE AWAY OR STAY RIGHT HERE
BUT LET ME MAKE ONE THING CLEAR

(CHORUS)
