You remind me of a Sunday
Back home in ole' Kentucky
With the church choirs just beltin' through the pines
And I love you like the mountains
Love's the way the mornin' opens
To a soft and bright greetin' from the sun
So if it'd make you stay
I wouldn't act so angry all the time
I wouldn't keep it all inside
And I'd let you know how much I loved you every day
So darlin' will ya stay right here
And shake this frost off of my bones
Well I used to ride a Mustang
And I'd run that thing on high hopes
Til' they raised the price of dreams so high I couldn't pay
So I let that car just sit there
When I should've took you driving
With the windows down while the music played
So if it'd make you stay
I wouldn't act so angry all the time
I wouldn't keep it all inside
And I'd let you know how much I loved you every day
So darlin' will ya stay right here
And shake this frost off of my bones
Darlin' will ya stay right here
And shake this frost off of my bones
