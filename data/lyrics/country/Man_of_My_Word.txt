I'm a man of my word, I mean what I say
My pledge is my bond that's just my way
When you've made a promise to someone who's gone
Well that's when forever seems a little too long
I'm a man of my word and I made you a vow
I swore that I'd love you and I can't change that now
They tell me I'm free to find someone new
I just don't have the heart 'cause I gave mine to you
I said my love would last for all time
And no one would take your place
Well if that promise was the last sound you heard
Well you know I kept it I'm a man of my word
I'm a man of my word and it's cost me so dear
'Cause those words are a prison without you here
And I'll go to my grave with this torch held high
Bust just once I wish I had told you a lie
When I said my love would last for all time
And no one would take your place
Well if that promise was the last sound you heard
Well you know I kept it, I'm a man of my word
Yes I'll always love you, I'm a man of my word
