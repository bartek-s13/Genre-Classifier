There's a jersey on the wall
In a high school gym in my hometown
In the corner by the scoreboard
Where the bleacher seats fold down
27 took the Tigers to the finals that year
But that's not why it's hanging there

If I ever get to Heaven
You know I got a long list of questions
Like how do You make a snowflake?
Are You angry when the earth quakes?
How does the sky change in a minute?
How do You keep this big rock spinning?
And why can't You stop a car from crashing?
Forgive me, I'm just asking

I bet, somewhere, there's a yearbook
In a box under a bed
With a senior picture missing
"In Loving Memory" instead
And somewhere there's a mother
Who stopped going to church
'Cause Your plan quit making sense down here on Earth
If I ever get to Heaven
You know I got a long list of questions
Like how do You make a snowflake?
Are You angry when the earth quakes?
How does the sky change in a minute?
How do You keep this big rock spinning?
Why couldn't You stop that car from crashing?
Forgive me, I'm just asking

Oh, I'm just saying
You don't have to answer now
Oh, but someday

If I ever get to Heaven
I got a long list of questions
Like how do You make a snowflake?
Are You angry when the earth quakes?
How does the sky change in a minute?
How do You keep this big rock spinning?
If You got Your hands on everything that happens
Then why couldn't You stop that car from crashing?
Forgive me, I'm just asking
I'm just asking
