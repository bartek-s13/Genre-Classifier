You can starve me for affection
Till my soul's just skin and bone
And make the words "I'm sorry"
Feel the same as throwing stones
In a room full of you
I might be standing all alone
But love don't die easy

I will stand in the thunder
And shiver in the rain
While I'm tied to the mast
Of a leaky boat in a hurricane
But I will find my way back to you
Even if it's all in vain
Love don't die easy

It won't be denied, it just does what it does
There ain't no way to kill it
When it's coursing through your blood
Shoot an arrow through the heart
The heart keeps on beating
Love don't die easy

It's that old man at the counter
Every morning sharp at nine
Where she stood him up for coffee
Some fifty years gone by
And it's this fool right here in front of you
Hoping you might change your mind
Love don't die easy

It won't be denied, it just does what it does
There ain't no way to kill it
When it's coursing through your blood
Shoot an arrow through the heart
The heart keeps on beating
Love don't die easy
My love won't die easy
