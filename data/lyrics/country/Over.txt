One hello, sweet night glow
I was fallin
You were so brown-eyed beautiful
Electric night, city sky, burning bright
One minute we were flying
Then we hit the ground down
He says that it's a mircale I'm still breathing at all

I can't go back to loving you
There's no way to change the truth
All that's left to do is let you go, ohh
I know that either way I'm on the edge
Trying to cross a broken bridge
Two steps back and one step closer
Baby you're something I'll never get over
Something I might never get over
Something I might never get over
Something I might never get over
Never get over you

I thought by now I'd have you figured out
If it was easy, I'd be moving on
Instead of picking up all these pieces
It is a miracle I'm still breathing at all

I can't go back to loving you
There's no way to change the truth
All that's left to do is let you go, ohh
I know that either way I'm on the edge
Trying to cross a broken bridge
Two steps back and one step closer
Baby you're something I'll never get over
Something I might never get over
Something I might never get over
Something I might never get over
Never get over you

You and I we were brand new lovers
Now you say, now you say you love her
You and I we were brand new lovers
Now you say, now you say you love her

I can't go back to loving you
There's no way to change the truth
All that's left to do is let you go, ohh
I know that either way I'm on the edge
Trying to cross a broken bridge
Two steps back and one step closer
Baby you're something I'll never get over
Something I might never get over
Something I might never get over
Something I might never get over
Never get over you

Something I might never get over
Something I might never get over
Something I might never get over
Never get over you
