I can't recall one time in my life
I've felt as lonely as I do tonight
I feel like I could lay down and get up no more
It's the damndest feeling, I never felt it before
Tonight I feel like an old violin
Soon to be put away and never played again
Don't ask me why I feel like this, hell I can't say
I only wish this feeling would just go away
I guess it's 'cause the truth is the hardest thing I ever faced
'Cause you can't change the truth in the slightest way
I tried
So I asked myself
I said "John, where do you go from here?
Then like a fool, I turned around and looked in the mirror
And there I would see an old violin
Soon to be put away and never played again
So one more time, just to be sure
I said "John, where in the hell do you go from here?"
You know there wasn't a nickel's worth of difference when I looked in the mirror
'Cause there I was seein' an old violin
Soon to be put away and never played again
And just like that, it hit me
Why that old violin and I were just alike
We'd give our all to music
And soon, we'd give our life
