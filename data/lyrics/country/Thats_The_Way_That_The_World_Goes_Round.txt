I know a guy that's got a lot to lose
He's a pretty nice fellow but he's kind of confused
He's got muscles in his head that ain't never been used
Thinks he own half of this town
Starts drinking heavy, gets a big red nose
Beats his old lady with a rubber hose
Then he takes her out to dinner and buys her new clothes
That's the way that the world goes 'round
That's the way that the world goes 'round
You're up one day and the next you're down
It's half an inch of water and you think you're gonna drown
That's the way that the world goes 'round
I was sitting in the bathtub counting my toes
When the radiator broke, water all froze
I got stuck in the ice without my clothes
Naked as the eyes of a clown
I was crying ice cubes hoping I'd croak
When the sun come through the window, the ice all broke
I stood up and laughed thought it was a joke
That's the way that the world goes 'round
