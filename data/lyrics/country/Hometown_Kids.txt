Boys roll up
Like they own the place
Girls dress down
With the plaids around their waist
Every Friday, Saturday Chevrolet
Out kicking up dust
On that two lane highway
No shame just doin' us

Cuz we are those born and raised on summer days
That every small town sings about
And we run every red light after midnight
We turn up when the sun sinks down
Yeah we're the spark of the lighter
Smoke from a bonfire
Blue jean all-nighters
Killin' time, killin' it with the hometown kids
We're the hometown kids

Headlights lit, we run these streets
We're home crowd, home team, homecoming kings and queens
Every Friday, Saturday same thing
Everybody meets up
On a backwoods backyard, back porch
Never gonna grow up
Cuz we are those born and raised on summer days
That every small town sings about
And we run every red light after midnight
We turn up when the sun sinks down
Yeah we're the spark of the lighter
Smoke from a bonfire
Blue jean all-nighters
Killin' time, killin' it with the hometown kids
We're the hometown kids

Every Friday, Saturday Chevrolet
Out kicking up dust
Every Friday, Saturday same thing
Just doin' us

Cuz we are those born and raised on summer days
That every small town song sings about
And we run every red light after midnight
We turn up when the sun sinks down
Yeah we're the spark of the lighter
Smoke from a bonfire
Blue jean all-nighters
Killin' time, killin' it with the hometown kids
We're the hometown kids
Yeah, the hometown kids
We're the hometown kids
