Well, I had two weeks vacation comin', so I thought I'd drive down to Florida: spend some time with an old friend, date a few girls, make a few parties, and just kinda live it up again
So I packed up my car, and then I called my Mom in Tennesee, and told her what I planned to do. She said, "Son, are you comin' by?" And I said, "Mom, I'm really pushed for time, but I'll see you in a week or two."
And I was drivin' through this little town in Georgia when I remembered: today's Mama's birthday. Well, I thought I'll just stop and wire some flowers. Shouldn't take too long; then I'll be on my way
So I walked in a flower shop and the first thing I saw was this little boy, with his eyes full a' tears. I said, "What's wrong, son?" He said, "Mama loves roses. And today's her birthday, and I haven't seen her in almost a year."

He said, "I live with Grandma now. But I promised Mama some roses, cause I talk to her all the time. I wanted to give her five, cause that's how old I am. But the lady said I couldn't buy 'em with just a dime."
Well, the little fella's story kind a' touched my heart, so I told the lady to give him what he wanted and charge it to me. Then I told her I needed to wire a dozen roses to my Mama, up in Chapel Hill, Tennessee
I looked around, and the little boy was gone. But all of a sudden the door flew open and he come runnin' back in and he said, "Mister, I forgot to thank you for the roses." He smiled, he shook my hand, and ran back out again
Well, I started on out of town. And I was feelin' real proud of myself for thinkin' of my Mama and really carin', when I looked out the window and I saw that same little boy, kneelin', by a grave in an old cemetery
I stopped my car and walked over to where the little boy was kneelin' down. And he smiled up at me and said, "This is where my Mama stays. She says she sure does thank you for these pretty roses." Well that's when I had to walk away
And I drove straight back to that flower shop and I said, "Lady, have you sent those flowers to Tennessee?" She said, "No, not yet." I said, "Well, nevermind. I'll just take them back with me."
