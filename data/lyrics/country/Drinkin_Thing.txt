Every day I tell myself it's temporary
That it's only 'cause she's young that makes her want another man
Even though she makes me feel unnecessary
I've found a way to help me understand
I've got this drinkin' thing
To keep from thinkin' things
About where you've been, who you've been with and what you've done
And it's a lonely thing
But it's the only thing
To keep a foolish man in love hangin' on
If I wait up at home, I'll only ask her questions
She'd probably the truth, so I don't even ask
So, I sit here on this barstool, feeling helpless
And I wonder just how long a man can last
I've got this drinkin' thing
To keep from thinkin' things
About where you've been, who you've been with and what you've done
And it's a lonely thing
But it's the only thing
To keep a foolish man in love hangin' on
I've got this drinkin' thing
To keep from thinkin' things
About where you've been, who you've been with and what you've done
