I got an old coffee mug that my granddad used to own
I’m sippin’ it slow on the porch and it’s good to be home
Watchin’ the sun come up and a dove on the wing
?I’m thinkin’ while I listen to the mockingbird sing
That I sure do love the simple things
The best things in life you don’t plug in
?A sky full of stars or a hand in the wind
?A long kiss, a good ol’ memory?
Keepin’ you grounded and makin’ you whole
Remindin’ you you’ve got a soul
Long as I’ve got a full belly, and a song to sing
I’ll be thankin’ God for the simple things
You got an egg in the skillet, I can smell it startin’ to fry
Hair pulled back in a ponytail outta your eyes?
Sayin’ good morning, I love you, how did you sleep
Might as well be poetry I feel it so deep
And you, you sure do know how to do those simple things
The best things in life, you don’t plug in?
A sky full of stars or a hand in the wind?
A long kiss, a good ol’ memory?
Keepin’ you grounded and makin’ you whole
Remindin’ you you’ve got a soul
Long as I’ve got a full belly, and a song to sing
I’ll be thankin’ God for the simple things
Yeah, you know me Baby I’m a simple man?
Live ‘til I die, Honey that’s the plan
?As long as I’ve got a full belly, and a song to sing
I’ll be thankin’ God for the simple things
?Yeah?
I thank God for the simple things, the simple things
Yeah
