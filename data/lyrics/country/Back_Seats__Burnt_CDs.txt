Like a red sunset you can't quite catch up to
You were not for me
Girl I was bad for you
And there weren't enough hours in the daylight
Whole summer you never left my side
Just holding you tight
While we were lettin' loose

We were Friday night lovers in the parking lot
We were renegades runnin' out of time on the clock
When the headlights died, no, we didn't stop
No, we didn't stop
(No, we didn't stop)
The heat between you and me
Got the windows tinted
Girl, one kiss and you had me wishin'
It was nothing but a teenage dream
Never thinkin' we'd leave
Back seats and burnt CDs
(Back seats and burnt CDs)

I think I could've made you stay if we had one more night
Feels like I woke up one day
And you weren't mine
Never saw your taillights in the distance
Girl, all you left me was your lipstick
Stain on my windshield
I still get chills
Thinkin' 'bout those days

We were Friday night lovers in the parking lot
We were renegades runnin' out of time on the clock
When the headlights died, no, we didn't stop
No, we didn't stop
(No, we didn't stop)
The heat between you and me
Got the windows tinted
Girl, one kiss and you had me wishin'
It was nothing but a teenage dream
Never thinkin' we'd leave
Back seats and burnt CDs
No, oh

Never saw your taillights in the distance
Wishin' for one more night when we were livin'
Givin' you everything in the heat of the July night
We were young, we were free, we were so alive
(We were Friday night lovers in the parking lot)

We were renegades runnin' out of time on the clock
When the headlights died, no, we didn't stop
No, we didn't stop
(No, we didn't stop)
The heat between you and me
Got the windows tinted
Girl, one kiss and you had me wishin'
It was nothing but a teenage dream
Never thinkin' we'd leave
Back seats and burnt CDs
Back seats and burnt CDs

And we were livin' for a Friday night
You always knew that we were young and wild
Sometimes I wonder if you're thinkin' 'bout me
Back seats and burnt CDs
