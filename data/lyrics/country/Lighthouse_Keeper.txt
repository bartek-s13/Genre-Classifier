A long haired man came to my door
Wearing Roman sandals carrying a golden sword
He said "Come with me and I'll take you higher"
We soared out of the atmosphere
On his magic carpet that he let me steer
Said "take the reins and I'll let you fly her"
We escalated through a thick of clouds
And our only thought was not coming down
Towards the amber glow I started to feel the fire
There was a unicorn with a neon horn
Wearing a velvet saddle that was slightly worn
I pulled my mystic rug right up beside her
I sat down on a floatin stool
She knelt her head and produced a jewel
And I smiled and asked if I could ride her
And I saw the lighthouse keeper
His hollow eyes that pierced my soul
He said that I'm just a desperate seeker
Searchin' for what I did not know
On Pegasus I was flying free
Careless lost over a purple sea
When I came upon this lonesome fortune teller
She gazed into her crystal ball
And I saw that giant gavel fall
She asked if I could be her pall bearer
And I heard that gypsy prophesy
Of the tearin flesh and the mother's cry
And the crimson flow of blood that would run forever
We stood before the kings and queens
And the hooded man with the guillotine
And prepared to meet the eternal tax collector
Then I dined there with an aristocrat on his balcony with a welcome mat
And he laughed and drank all the wine from the cellar
