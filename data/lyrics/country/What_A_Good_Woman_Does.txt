I can't carry the weight of this war
I can't do it anymore
Everyone's wounded; nobody's won

Hear me; I haven't lost my voice
Without you near me, I could tell the truth about you leaving
But that's not what a good woman does

Well, don't feel sorry for yourself
You got everything you want
Everyone's watching you pick up and run

So hear me; I haven't lost my voice
Without you near me, I could tell the truth about you leaving
But that's not what a good woman does

Ooh, what a good woman does
That's not what a good woman
Ooh, that's not what a good woman does

Can't carry the weight of this war
I won't do it anymore

Hear me; I haven't lost my voice
Without you near me, I could tell the truth about you leaving
But that's not what a good woman does

Ooh, what a good woman does
That's not what a good woman
Ooh, that's not what a good woman does
