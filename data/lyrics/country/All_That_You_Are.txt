Haven't seen you round in a while and
Thought you'd find a girl and make a life there
I didn't know that you'd be coming home
You haven't changed a lot since I saw you
When I hear your voice say, "How are you?"
I just wanna be wrapped in those arms
Well maybe if I just take it slow
There's something that I need you to know
I've be waitin all of this time
Wanna tell you that I still love, still love you
It's been something stuck in my mind
I've been loosing sleep at night
Cuz I love all that you are
Remember that old bar that you worked in?
I was there on Friday night singin' songs about a boy I used to know
Took me by suprise when you walked in
Had a million feels come crashing back into my head and in my soul
There's something that I need you to know
I've be waitin all of this time
Wanna tell you that I still love, still love you
It's been something stuck in my mind
I've been loosing sleep at night
Cuz I love all that you are
?
Don't care
Cuz now that you're home
I ain't letting you go
These feelings ain't gone boy I need you to know
And I can feel your gentle hands runnin' through my hair
It's just you and I paradise
Stormy nights lost in your eyes
I've be waitin all of this time
Wanna tell you that I still love, still love you
I've be waitin all of this time
Wanna tell you that I still love, still love you
It's been something stuck in my mind
I've been loosing sleep at night
Cuz I love all that you are
