I could fly away
Leave for good today
To a new world somewhere far beyond
Or you could set sail
For the sun’s fading trail
And I could watch you till you’re gone
But it wouldn’t matter now
No it couldn’t change what I see
If a thousand miles lay between us today
You’re still at the heart of me
If your face can’t be
Ever here before me
I can always hold you in my mind
And live in the past
Your ghost gave up at last
More real now than passing time
But it wouldn’t matter now
It couldn’t change what I see
If a thousand miles lay between us today
You’re still at the heart of me
Time’s been a shroud
And it’s left me confused
Surrendered to pain in the name of a truth
That sang in my ear all that I stood to lose
Come what may
Our faith is a well
And down deep I can tell
I’m as thirsty as a mortal can be
Silence abounds
And it’s ringing through town
Like a bell swinging high over me
And it wouldn’t matter now
No it couldn’t change what I see
If a thousand miles lay between us today
You’re still at the heart of me
If a thousand miles lay between us today
You’re still at the heart of me
