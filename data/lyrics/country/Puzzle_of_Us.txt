Top left corner, red sun was shinin'
Above a big blue sky with the black birds flyin'
Field of green grass and yellow sunflowers
Rainbow hangin' in the mist of the summer shower
And then there's me, out here in the middle, it's no big riddle

The only piece missin' is you
Fallin' into my kiss
Your hand slippin' through my fingertips
Locked up in my arms where you perfectly fit
I wanna hold you so close
I can feel your heartbeat
And be the air that you breathe
And together you and me can put together all the colors of love
Yeah we'll build the puzzle of us

Mighty fine picture and we'll be
All the curves and the edges of you and me
But there's a fragile magical lonely place
So come on and lay down beside me in this empty space
Cause it's just me out here in the middle, it's no big riddle

The only piece missin' is you
Fallin' into my kiss
Your hand slippin' through my fingertips
Locked up in my arms where you perfectly fit
I wanna hold you so close
I can feel your heartbeat
And be the air that you breathe
And together you and me can put together all the colors of love
Yeah well that's the puzzle of us

I said the only piece missin' is you
Fallin' into my kiss
Your hand slippin' through my fingertips
Locked up in my arms where you perfectly fit
Cause you perfectly fit
I wanna hold you so close
I can feel your heartbeat
And be the air that you breathe
And together you and me can put together all the colors of love
Yeah together you and me can put together all the colors of love
We'll build the puzzle of us
Yeah that's the puzzle of us
That's the puzzle of us, darlin'
We'll build the puzzle of us
