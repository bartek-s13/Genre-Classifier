Bell bottoms were really cool
Cutting class and skipping school
I remember packing that old fishing pole
Skinny-dipping at a swimming hole
Back light, red lights and strobe lights too
Were all the rage for me and you
Only one thing I miss more than that:
I want my mullet back

I want my mullet back
My old Camero, and my eight-track
Fuzzy dice hanging loose and proud
ZZ Top, they're playing loud
A simple time, that's what I miss
Your mini-skirt and your sweet kiss
Things are changing man, and that's a fact
I want my mullet back

Back. Back
Back. Back
Back. Back

I want my mullet back
My old Camero, and my eight-track
Fuzzy dice hanging loose and proud
Lynrd Skynrd, they're playing loud
A simple time, that's what I miss
Your mini-skirt and your sweet kiss
Things are changing man, and that's a fact
I want my mullet back
I want my mullet back
My old Camero, and my eight-track
Fuzzy dice hanging loose and proud
Bob Seger singing and I'm out in the crowd
A simple time, that's what I miss
Your mini-skirt and your sweet kiss
Things are changing man, and that's a fact
I want my mullet back

I want my mullet back
I want my mullet back
I want my mullet back
I want my mullet back
Ow!
