Blame this messed up knee on a cross country team in the Friday night lights
Blame the scar on my chin for getting mixed up in that "you don't mess with my best friend" fight
And the yes sir, yes ma'am, never quit, give a damn was handed down from my old man
Blame it all on my momma for my tendency to wanna bow my head and say amen

But when it comes to holdin' on to a long gone lonely at last call, wanna call her up
And that missin' side of me takes a Whitley side B
Drops a needle on it, back to front
And the pissed off part of me is hanging on a memory of me Walking out on what ain't ever comin' back
Yeah, you can thank me for that
You can thank me for that

Wish I could point a little blame
But there ain't one thing that she did wrong
Just one lie about some other guy
Would put some move in my movin' on
And all I can pin on that girl is that she took my world
And made it better with her in it
Now there ain't no other way to spin it

But when it comes to holdin' on to a long gone, lonely at last call, wanna call her up
And that missin' side of me takes a Whitley side B
Drops a needle on it, back to front
And the pissed off part of me is hanging on a memory of me Walking out on what ain't ever comin' back

You can thank me for the messed up head
And that part that won't let me stop missin' her
When I go to point a finger I just aim it at the man in the mirror
Yeah...

But when it comes to holdin' on to a long gone, lonely at last call, wanna call her up
And that missin' side of me takes a Whitley side B
Drops a needle on it, back to front
And the pissed off part of me is hanging on a memory of me Walking out on what ain't ever comin' back
Yeah, you can thank me for that
You can thank me for that

Oh...
You can thank me for that
