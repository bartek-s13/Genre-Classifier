On that very first day, the Lord sat down
And saw fit to say “let there be light!”
So He can tell the day time from the night
And then He spoke again and felt the wind
Come rolling in, smelt the rain
It soaked everything
Then the mountains rose up
Across the great planes
And all the angels up in Heaven started singing
“all it’s missing is a pretty thing”
Let there be cowgirls for every cowboy
Make them strong as any man... Lordy
Something you can’t tame, she’s a Mustang
The heart beat of the heartland
She’s got a drawl yall, yeah
She’s the salt of the earth and rocks my world
Let there be cowgirls, come on
He met me back in ’68
The first time I met her I was nearly eight
And she was ten
Her name was little Kay Lynn
She was born to a farmer who was friends with my father
I was in love with a sharecropper's only daughter
Thought I was in, it made me think again
But when I turned 16
I thought it couldn’t get worse
I saw her riding on a horse and fell in love so bad it hurt
Let there be cowgirls for every cowboy
Make them strong as any man
Something you can’t tame, she’s a Mustang
The heart beat of the heartland
She’s got a drawl yall, yeah
She’s the salt of the earth and rocks my world
Let there be cowgirls, come on
Let there be cowgirls
Let there be cowgirls for every cowboy
Make them strong as any man
Something you can’t tame, she’s a Mustang
The heart beat of the heartland
She’s got a drawl yall, yeah
She’s the salt of the earth and rocks my world
Let there be cowgirls, come on
