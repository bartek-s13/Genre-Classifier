I pledge allegiance to the flag
Of the United States of America
I'll stand and place my hand upon my heart
Every time her anthem plays
When I see somebody on TV
Take their stand on bended knee
Whether it's on astroturf or grass
I think of those whose freedom was not free
And I say, "Take a knee, my ass!"

I'll stand up for the flag
Take off my hat for Old Glory
Thank God I live in the home of the brave
And the land of the free
I'll honor the ones who gave it all
So we're all free to go play ball
If only for their sake
I won't take a knee

From Valley Forge to Vietnam
9/11 to Afghanistan
That star-spangled banner does yet wave
I won't forget I owe a debt of gratitude
I never can repay
Arm and arm and side by side
American heroes fought and died
Is showing some respect too much to ask?
I speak for those whose freedom was not free
And I say, "Take a knee, my ass!"
I'll stand up for the flag
Take off my hat for Old Glory
Thank God I live in the home of the brave
And the land of the free
I'll honor the ones who gave it all
So we're all free to go play ball
If only for their sake
I won't take a knee
O say can you see?
If only for their sake
I won't take a knee
