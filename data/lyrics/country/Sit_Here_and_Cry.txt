I was standing in the yard watching you go
You only been gone about an hour or so
I'm already wondering what I'll do
All by myself without you
Then it hit me like a lightning crash
I'm gonna sit here and cry until you come back
Better tell the boss I can't come in
At least not until you love me again
Mommy's gonna get a little bit tired
But it's okay, it's alright
It don't take a whole lot of cash
To sit here and cry til you come back

Sit here alone wondering why
Count every tear that I can cry
Broke down train on a one-way track
Gonna sit here and cry til you come back
Well I guess I didn't really think this through
But I'll lose my mind when it comes to you
Been out here every night and day
Waiting on the blues to go away
But I just think they're gonna turn black
Gonna sit here and cry til you come back

Feel like I'm gonna have a heart attack
Gonna sit here and cry until you come back
Sit here and cry til you come back
Sit here and cry til you come back
