Don't know why you must go
I'm not sure, you really know
Remember me, how easy and tender that it used to be
There's no right, there's no wrong
I just want you back where you belong
And that's why
I will leave the light on
I will leave the light on
I will leave the light on for you
You can run, but you can't hide
From the feeling you bury inside
In my heart, I know this is true
It's one of the things that I learned from you
Lovers come, lovers go
And there's much more to this than you know
That is why
I will leave the light on
I will leave the light on
I will leave the light on for you
When your fairweather friends
Leave you standing by yourself in the pouring rain
When the nights are dark and lonely
Call my name, call my name
You can retrace your steps
Oh, but don't you forget
I will leave the light on
I will leave the light on
I will leave the light on for you
Don't know why you have gone
Hope you can find your way home
Until then...I will leave the light on
I will leave the light on
I will leave the light on for you
