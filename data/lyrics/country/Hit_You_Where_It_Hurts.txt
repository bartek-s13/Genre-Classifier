Can't believe I was so naive about it
A little too trusting, never even doubted
Lookin' back now, figurin' out
I was the last one to know in the whole damn town
I can't believe I was so naive about it

Every nightmare and every dream
I'm gonna make sure that you see
Exactly what you did to me
It'll feel just like a curse
It'll knock you in the dirt
And just when you think it can't get worse
I'm gonna hit you where it hurts

I'm gonna stand my ground, I won't bow down to you
I ain't leavin' town after all the hell I've been through
I can move on and find another
But you're the one that needs to suffer
Stand my ground, I won't bow down to you

Every nightmare and every dream
I'm gonna make sure that you see
Exactly what you did to me
It'll feel just like a curse
It'll knock you in the dirt
And just when you think it can't get worse
I'm gonna hit you where it hurts
I'm gonna hit you where it hurts
I'm gonna hit you where it hurts
Every nightmare and every dream
I'm gonna make sure that you see
Exactly what you did to me
It'll feel just like a curse
It'll knock you in the dirt
And just when you think it can't get worse
I'm gonna hit you where it hurts
I'm gonna hit you where it hurts
