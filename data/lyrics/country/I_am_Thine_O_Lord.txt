(Fanny J. Crosby - William Howard Doane)
I am Thine oh Lord, I have heard Thy voice
And it told Thy love to me
But I long to rise in the arms of faith
And be closer drawn to Thee
Draw me nearer, nearer blessed Lord
To the cross where Thou has died
Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer blessed Lord
To Thine precious bleeding side
Consecrate me now to Thy service Lord
By the power of grace divine
Let my soul look up with a steadfast hope
And my will be lost in Thine
Draw me nearer, nearer blessed Lord
To the cross where Thou has died
Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer blessed Lord
To Thine precious bleeding side

There are depths of love that I cannot know
Till I cross the narrow sea
There are heights of joy that I may not reach
Till I rest in peace with Thee
Draw me nearer, nearer blessed Lord
To the cross where Thou has died
Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer blessed Lord
To Thine precious bleeding side...
