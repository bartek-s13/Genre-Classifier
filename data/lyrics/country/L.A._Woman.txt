I was midnight blowing my midwest money
At the whiskey on the Sunset Strip
Just trying to catch a buzz, listening to some Guns
You dug I wasn't trying to be hip

With those Malibu eyes, Hollywood smile
You know I couldn't leave you alone
Cause you make me feel like Beverly Hills
On the cover of Rolling Stone

Ooh, L.A. woman
That's gotta be the shortest dress I've ever seen
Ooh, L.A. woman
I know I've been drinking, but I'm thinking you're falling for me
Yeah
Come on

Well, forget about that dude you been talking to
And just slide into my booth and sit down
Well, these drinks ain't cheap, so baby dig down deep
In my pocket for another round
With those Malibu eyes, Hollywood smile
You know I couldn't leave you alone
Cause you make me feel like Beverly Hills
On the cover of Rolling Stone

Ooh, L.A. woman
That's gotta be the shortest dress I've ever seen
Ooh, L.A. woman
I know I've been drinking, but I'm thinking you're falling for me

Malibu eyes
Yeah, your Hollywood smile
California girls
Oh, never go out of style
With those Malibu eyes
Yeah, that Hollywood smile
California girls
Oh, never go out, never go out of style

Ooh, L.A. woman
That's gotta be the shortest dress I've ever seen
Ooh, L.A. woman
I know I've been drinking, but I'm thinking you're falling for me
Ooh, L.A. woman
Ooh, L.A. woman
