You pour out your heart right on this kitchen floor
I spill one more tear on the table and slam the door
We act like we don't give a damn no more
We'll fill this house with sorry in the morning

Hey, sometimes it's good and sweet
Hey, sometimes it turns into a bitter thing
But when it comes to you, when it comes to me
Love and misery look the same
But it ain't our fault
We're just sugar and salt

When we were young, we thought'd be a piece of cake
Now we spend our whole lives tryin' to acquire the taste
Of something that is always bound to change
But giving up this love would go against the grain
Go against the grain

Hey, sometimes it's good and sweet
Hey, sometimes it turns into a bitter thing
But when it comes to you, when it comes to me
Love and misery look the same
But it ain't our fault
We're just sugar and salt

Ooh
Ooh

Hey, sometimes it's good and sweet
Hey, sometimes it turns into a bitter thing
But when it comes to you, when it comes to me
Love and misery look the same
But it ain't our fault
We're just sugar and salt
No, it ain't our fault
We're just sugar and salt
