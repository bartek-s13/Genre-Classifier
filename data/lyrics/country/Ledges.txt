I've got a lot of loose ends, I've done some damage
I've cut the rope so it frays
I've got a lot of good friends keepin' me distracted
Keepin' my sanity safe
Here I stand on the edge of the ledge inside of me
Searchin' for a steady hand
Here I stand in the land full of rocks in the valley
Oh I'm tryna be a better man
For you
I drink a little too much
It makes me nervous
I've got my grandfathers blood
I take a little too much without given back
If blessed are the meek then I'm cursed
Here I stand on the edge of the ledge inside of me
Searchin' for a steady hand
Here I stand in the land full of rocks in the valley
Oh I'm tryna be a better man
For you
Here I stand on the edge of the ledge inside of me
Searchin' for a steady hand
Here I stand in the land full of rocks in the valley
Oh I'm tryna be a better man
Here I stand on the edge of the ledge inside of me
Searchin' for a steady hand
Here I stand in the land full of rocks in the valley
Oh I'm tryna be a better man
