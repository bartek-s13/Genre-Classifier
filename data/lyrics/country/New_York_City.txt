She came to me shortly after Christmas
Said she hated spoiling New Year's Eve
But the truth doesn't wait to come in season
And what we had feared was now believed
She said she'd leave come Monday morning
Catch a plane if I'd split the fare
She had friends who lived in New York City
She'd look them up and have the baby there
And now she's alone in New York City (New York City)
Living like ... Lord, I wonder how
An angel in hell in New York City (New York City)
But I can't think about that now
Honey, will you tell him Bible stories
And give him all the love I never could?
And never tell him too much 'bout his daddy
'Cause there's not too much to say that's good
He'll have to learn it all from his mother:
How to count and say his A-B-C's
But when you teach him prayers to say at bedtime
Leave off "God bless Daddy," won't you please?
And now they're alone in New York City (New York City)
Living like ... Lord, I wonder how
Two angels in hell in New York City (New York City)
But I can't think about that now
I can't think about that now
