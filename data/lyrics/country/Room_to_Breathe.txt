Girl, you got my heart beating out of my chest
Oh, baby, give me what you got
Until there ain't nothing left
Bring it close, don't leave any space
Want you to be apart of me
Never want to separate
I'm a little obsessed with you
Ought to change my address to you

I don't need no room to breathe
No, nothing in between
Don't wanna go nowhere without your hands on me
No, I can't get enough
Cover me in your love
Oh, don't you move
I don't need no room to breathe, breathe
Baby, you can never be too close to me

Girl, I've always been one of those guys
Never want to be tied down
But girl, you've got me now
I don't ever want to be
Independent, single, free
Come on over here to me, never leave

I don't need no room to breathe
No, nothing in between
Don't wanna go nowhere without your hands on me
No, I can't get enough
Cover me in your love
Oh, don't you move
I don't need no room to breathe, breathe
Baby, you can never be too close to me

I'm a little obsessed with you
I'll change my address to you
Be the person next to you

I don't need no room to breathe
No, nothing in between
Don't wanna go nowhere without your hands on me
No, I can't get enough
Cover me in your love
Oh, don't you move
I don't need no room to breathe, breathe
Baby, you can never be too close to me

Take my breath from me
Oh, baby, please
I don't need no room to breathe
