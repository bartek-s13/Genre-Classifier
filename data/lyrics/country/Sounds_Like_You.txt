Bald tires on a rusted-out ragtop
Hummin' down the highway
Spinning 'round singing with the blacktop
Baby, anytime I start to miss
How the sunlight hit your skin
And your hair blew in the wind
I go driving around like this

And it sounds like you
Your gold cross swinging from the rearview
Mixtape still playing like brand new
I know it's over babe
Oh, but it don't feel that way
When it sounds like you
When it sounds like you

Ain't a trace of you left in this map dot
Nowhere nothing town
But here I am and all I've got
Is driving me around and crazy
I'm hearing ghosts here lately
Down every road, it's the same thing
There you are again
And it sounds like you
Your gold cross swinging from the rearview
Mixtape still playing like brand new
I know it's over babe
Oh, but it don't feel that way
When it sounds like you
When it sounds like you
When it sounds like you

Yeah, I know you ain't there
But girl sometimes I swear
It's like you never really left at all
When it sounds like you

When it sounds like you
Your gold cross swinging from the rearview
Mixtape still playing like brand new
I know it's over babe
Oh, but it don't feel that way
When it sounds like you
When it sounds like you
When it sounds like you
