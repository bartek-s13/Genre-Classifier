Let me tell you 'bout Willie the weeper
Willie the weeper was a chimney sweeper
He had the hop habit and he had it bad
Listen while I tell you 'bout a dream he had
Hi-de-hi-de-hi (Hi-de-hi-de-hi) Ho-de-ho-de-ho (Ho-de-ho-de-ho)
Willie went to a hop-joint late last night
He knew that the light would be burnin' bright
I guess he must've smoked a dozen pills or more
'Cause when he woke up he was on a foreign shore
Hi-de-hi-de-hi (Hi-de-hi-de-hi) Ho-de-ho-de-ho (Ho-de-ho-de-ho)
The queen of Belgium was the first he met
She called him her darlin' and her lovin' pet
She gave him a genuine Ford automobile
With a diamond headlight and silver steering wheel
Hi-de-hi-de-hi (Hi-de-hi-de-hi) Ho-de-ho-de-ho (Ho-de-ho-de-ho)
She had a million cattle and she had a million sheep
She had a million vessels in the ocean deep
She had a million dollars all in nickels and dimes
He knew it 'cause he counted them a million times
Hi-de-hi-de-hi (Hi-de-hi-de-hi) Ho-de-ho-de-ho (Ho-de-ho-de-ho)
Willie got to New York one night late
He called his sugar baby up for a date
He got funny and began to shout
And blim-blam-bloom, well, the dope give out
Hi-de-hi-de-hi (Hi-de-hi-de-hi) Ho-de-ho-de-ho (Ho-de-ho-de-ho)
