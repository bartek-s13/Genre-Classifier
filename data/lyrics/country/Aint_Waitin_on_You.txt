I've been working long, hot days
I get up early, I come home late
But you're not around
I ain't waiting on you

It's been two years without much luck
Been trying hard to move on up
That business chain
To prove to you

That I don't need your touch
And I don't need your love
I ain't waiting on you

I saw your mama, she said some things
She thinks you're crazy for leaving me
But that's alright
I ain't waiting on you

'Cause I don't need your touch
And I don't need your love
I ain't waiting on you

And that's alright now, Darling
I know it's your new thing
So if you don't mind me asking
Well, I'd like back my ring

I ain't waiting on you
I ain't waiting on you

I've been working long, hot days
I get up early, I come home late
But you're not around
But I ain't waiting on you
