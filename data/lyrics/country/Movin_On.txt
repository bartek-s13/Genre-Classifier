You can walk in the door of that bar
And not wonder where they are
You can run into one of their friends
Without asking how they've been
The memories all over that town
Finally ain't tearing you down

No more drinking alone
Staring at that phone
Drive by that house and don't care if they're home
One day, you'll wake up, the hurt ain't as strong
Maybe, maybe, maybe you're just movin' on

If it's true, the sound of their name doesn't phase you
Or shake you up
And if it's true, the side of the bed where they slept ain't as cold
Baby you're getting over the

No more drinking alone
Staring at that phone
Drive by that house and don't care if they're home
One day, you'll wake up, the hurt ain't as strong
Maybe, maybe, maybe you're just movin' on
The memories all over that town
Finally ain't tearing you down

No more drinking alone
Staring at that phone
Drive by that house and don't care if they're home
One day, you'll wake up, the hurt ain't as strong
Maybe, maybe, maybe

You ain't drinking alone
Staring at that phone
Drive by that house and don't care if they're home
One day, you'll wake up, the hurt ain't as strong
Maybe, maybe, maybe you're just movin' on
Maybe you're just movin' on
