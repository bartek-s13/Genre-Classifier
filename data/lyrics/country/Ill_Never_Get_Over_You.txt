I'll still be sitting right here
Thinking ’bout you, drinking this beer
Wishing I'd done everything right
Hoping you'll come back to me one night
I’ll never get over you

You'll do whatever you want to
You'll make a million friends
You'll get wherever you're going to
Yeah, you'll fall in love again

But I'll still be sitting right here
Thinking 'bout you, drinking this beer
Wishing I’d done everything right
Hoping you’ll come back to me one night
I'll never get over you

Dreaming, that’s what I'm doing
Wasting all of my time
Oh, but it don't matter once you ruin
The best thing you've ever gonna find
But I’ll still be sitting right here
Thinking 'bout you, drinking this beer
Wishing I'd done everything right
Hoping you'll come back to me one night
I'll never get over you
I'll never get over you

As long as I live I'll never give up
Thinking I can win back your love

Yeah, I'll still be sitting right here
Thinking 'bout you, drinking this beer
Wishing I'd done everything right
Hoping you'll come back to me one night
I'll never get over you
I'll still be sitting right here
Thinking 'bout you, drinking this beer
Wishing I'd done everything right
Hoping you'll come back to me one night
I'll never get over you
No, I'll never get over you
