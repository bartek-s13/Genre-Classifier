I've been waiting for a girl like you
Been waiting for a long time
And I've been waiting for a love that's true
Been waiting for a long time

I been waitin' for blue skies
Been waiting for blue eyes
Waiting for a long time
I've been standing in the pouring rain
Waiting for you-oo
Waiting for a long time


I've been staring at a miracle of mysery
Been waiting for a long time
I've been praying for a miracle of mystery
Been waiting for a long time
I've been hoping that some day
Love will find me some way, yeah
Waiting for a long time
I've been waiting for a long, lost train
Waiting for you-oo-oo
Waiting for a long time


I've been hoping that some day
Love will find me some way
Waiting for a long time
I've been standing in the pouring rain
Waiting for you-oo
Waiting for a long time

I've been waiting on a long, lost train
Waiting for you-oo-oo
Waiting for a long time
Waitin' for a long time
