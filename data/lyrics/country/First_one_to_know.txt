If I let you down, I'll be fast as lightening
Here and gone like the storm that you're riding
It won't take long, and I'll turn a stone
When I lift you up, I'll be slow and easy
And I can't blame you if you don't believe me
Hope comes along, I'll keep you safe and warm
If I'm not acting like myself lately, doing things that I don't
Not sure why, but you want to hate me, it's just a spell I suppose
When I'm back to my old self again my love
You'll be the first one to know
I guess we're all just getting older
Looking back in time over our shoulder
Right or wrong, there's two sides to every song
If I'm not acting like myself lately, doing things that I don't
I'm not sure why, but you want to hate me, it's just a spell I suppose
When I'm back to my old self again, my love
You'll be the first one to know
When I'm back to my old self again, my love
You'll be the first one to know
