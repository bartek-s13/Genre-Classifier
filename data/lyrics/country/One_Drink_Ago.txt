Thank God, I needed that one more whiskey
And somebody bumped you right up against me
And you spilled your drink on my favorite shirt
Had nothing to lose so I dropped that line
That never works
But it worked on you
One drink ago I was playing it cool
You were here with friends, I was shooting pool
Now it's crazy how a "Hey what you having?"
Turned into a "How'd this happen?"
Now the whole night's spinning like an empty bottle
With who knows what else left to follow
It's 3 am, just the two of us
Standing here, wondering how we'll ever live without
What we didn't know
One drink ago
I swear I never saw you coming
Never thought I'd fall like this from me stumbling
Into your glass, into your arms
Now we're under the stars, leaning on the car
In the parking lot, boy look what you started
One drink ago I was playing it cool
You were here with friends, I was shooting pool
Now it's crazy how a "Hey what you having?"
Turned into a "How'd this happen?"
Now the whole night's spinning like an empty bottle
With who knows what else left to follow
It's 3 am, just the two of us
Standing here, wondering how we'll ever live without
What we didn't know
One drink ago
Bet you didn't even know my name
Bet you weren't looking for a heart to tame
And we'd been watching the starlight fade away
One drink ago I was playing it cool
You were here with friends, I was shooting pool
Now it's crazy how a "Hey what you having?"
Turned into a "How'd this happen?"
Now the whole night's spinning like an empty bottle
With who knows what else left to follow
It's 3 am, just the two of us
Standing here, wondering how we'll ever live without
What we didn't know
One drink ago
