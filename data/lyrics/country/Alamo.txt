In front of the Alamo
In the fading light of the Texas day,San Antonio
Through the windshield of a Chevrolet
With the front tires pointed out of town
She sighs and rolls the window down
Counts to three and throws that wedding band
In front of the Alamo
That's a pretty good place to make a stand
In front of the Alamo
Where the cameras click and the tourists stare
Long, long time ago
She met the man in question there
She wanted trust, she wanted truth
Two things he found hard to do
So forever was shorter than she planned
In front of the Alamo
That's a pretty good place to make a stand
She didn't come for inspiration
Or to breathe the mighty dust of heroes lost
She just felt the time was right
At this random traffic light
To say, 'Enough is enough' and move on
In front of the Alamo
In the fading light of the Texas day,San Antonio
Through the windshield of a Chevrolet
Maybe something in the air
Makes the timid braver there
To cross the line that they've drawn in the sand
In front of the Alamo
They held on, she lets go
In front of the Alamo
That's a pretty good place to make a stand
