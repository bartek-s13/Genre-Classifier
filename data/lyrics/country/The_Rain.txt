Lately things ain't been goin' my way
I've tried everything, scraped my knees prayin'
But when the storms roll in, sometimes God's will is for us to just be still
‘Cause everything works out just how it should
Cursing these clouds won't do me no good
Beauty lies in things that I can't change
I know that this gray sky's gonna turn blue
It'll stop hurting, the sun will shine through
But for now I'm thankful for this hurricane
Everybody knows nothing grows without the rain
I've heard the brightest days follow the darkest hours
‘Cause it ain't just golden rays that sustain a flower
So when the waters rise and the winds blow
I will cling to the hope
That everything works out just how it should
Cursing these clouds won't do me no good
Beauty lies in things that I can't change
I know that this gray sky's gonna turn blue
It'll stop hurting, the sun will shine through
But for now I'm thankful for this hurricane
Everybody knows that nothing grows without the rain
So let it fall
And any thoughts I've had of doing this on my own, drown them all
Cause everything works out just how it should
Cursing these clouds won't do me no good
Beauty lies in things that I can't change
I know that this gray sky's gonna turn blue
It'll stop hurting, the sun will shine through
But for now I'm thankful for this hurricane
Everybody knows that nothing grows without the rain
