So long to the red river valley
My ropin' and wranglin' is through
And so farewell to the home corral
And all the old friends that I knew
Goodbye to the old empty bunkhouse
Where I dreamed the hours away
Send my mail to the end of the trail
So long to the red river valley
I'll roll up my beddin' and pack up my clothes
And lighten my heart with a song
For where I'll be travelin', nobody knows
But I'll have to be movin' along
So long to the red river valley
My ropin' and wranglin' is through
And so farewell to the home corral
And all the old friends that I knew
Goodbye to the old empty bunkhouse
Where I dreamed the hours away
Send my mail to the end of the trail
So long to the red river valley
