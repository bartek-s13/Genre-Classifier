I’ve been fighting with these sheets again
Can't make myself lie still
My pillowcase is soaking wet
And yet I feel the chill
It takes all I can do these days
To just survive the nights
It gets crazy when a man can't get a woman off his mind

When a man can't shake a memory
He runs hot and cold and blind
He hates her, then he loves her
Then he hates her one more time
Your love has such a grip on me
It chokes me like a vine
Ain’t it crazy when a man can't get a woman off his mind

I've been phoning you since eight o'clock
It's almost four A.M
My mind keeps painting pictures
Of you out loving him
I just crushed a Dixie cup
For running out of wine
It gets crazy
When a man can get a woman off his mind

When a man can't shake a memory
He runs hot and cold and blind
He hates her, then he loves her
Then he hates her one more time
Your love has such a grip on me
It chokes me like a vine
Ain’t it crazy when a man can't get a woman off his mind

Drives him crazy
When a man can't get his woman off his mind
