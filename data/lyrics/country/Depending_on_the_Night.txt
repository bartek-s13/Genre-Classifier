Sometimes she's gettin' all dolled up
In her sequin dress and her highest heels
Sometimes she likes her muddy blue jeans
On a river bank with a rod and reel
Sometimes she's in bed by nine tucked tight with a book in her hand
Sometimes she's a dance downtown until they kick her out at 3am

Depending on the night
She's alright with just sittin' at home
Depending on the night
She's halfway through a fifth of patron
When she makes up her mind, better hold on tight
You best be ready to go
Depending on the night
Depending on the night

Sometimes she's a county road cruise control
On her way to nowhere fast
Sometimes she's a vinyl record spinning
Playin' everything from Journey to Cash
Sometimes she's a "need her space"
And sometimes she begs me to stay
Depending on the night
She's alright with just sittin' at home
Depending on the night
She's halfway through a fifth of patron
When she makes up her mind, better hold on tight
You best be ready to go
Depending on the night
Depending on the night

Oh you never know
No you never know
What you're gonna get with her
Depending on the night
Oh, depending on the night

Depending on the night
She's alright with just sittin' at home
Depending on the night
She's halfway through a fifth of patron
When she makes up her mind, better hold on tight
You best be ready to go
Depending on the night
Depending on the night
