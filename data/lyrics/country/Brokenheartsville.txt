He wore that cowboy hat to cover up his horns
Sweet talking forked tongue, had a tempting charm
Before I turned around that girl was gone
All I can say is, bartender pour me something strong
Here's to the past, they can kiss my glass
I hope she's happy with him
Here's to the girl who wrecked my world
That angel who did me in
I think the devil drives a Coupe de Ville
I watched 'em drive away over the hill
Not against her will and I've got time to kill
Down in Brokenheartsville
It was long and chrome, sitting in the lot
Fire engine red, that thing was hot
He reved it up, she waved goodbye
Love's gone to hell and so have I
Here's to the past, they can kiss my glass
I hope she's happy with him
Here's to the girl who wrecked my world
That angel who did me in
I think the devil drives a Coupe de Ville
I watched 'em drive away over the hill
Not against her will and I've got time to kill
Down in Brokenheartsville
Here's to the past, they can kiss my glass
I hope she's happy with him
Here's to the girl who wrecked my world
That angel who did me in
I think the devil drives a Coupe de Ville
I watched 'em drive away over the hill
Not against her will and I've got time to kill
Down in Brokenheartsville
