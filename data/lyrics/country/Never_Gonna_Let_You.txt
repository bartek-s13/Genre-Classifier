Today you woke up
And painted all four of your walls in black
You hung up you hat 'cause
Sticks and stones have overgrown
And now you’re just mad
And I can’t fix that

But you count on me
Just like the sun rises in the east
When you’ve had enough
Seems like giving up
Is all that’s left to do
Even if you want to
I’m never gonna let you
I’m never gonna let you

So throw your tantrum
Then go and throw all your garbage away
Get rid of yesterday
Pick yourself up
Then fill your half empty cup up with faith
It’s gonna be okay
Cause you count on me
Just like the sun rises in the east
When you’ve had enough
Seems like giving up
Is all that’s left to do
Even if you want to
I’m never gonna let you
I’m never gonna let you

I’m never gonna let you
Stop your dreamin?
Stop believing
Ohh woahh ohh
Ohh woahh ohh

Yeah you can count
You can count on me
Just like the sun rises in the east
When you’ve had enough
Seems like giving up
Is all that’s left to do

Ohhhh
Even if you want to
I’m never gonna let you
I’m never gonna let you
No ohhh
I’m never gonna let you
Noo
I’m never gonna let you
Ohh woahh ohh
Ohh woahh ohh
Ohh woahh ohh
Ohh woahh ohh
