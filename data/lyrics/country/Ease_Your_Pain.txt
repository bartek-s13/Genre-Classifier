I can be your midnight
"Are you up"
Every time that he does
He does you like he does
I can let you dry your tears
Tell you what you wanna hear
But when you've had enough
Baby I
I can be the shot of whiskey
Your memory novocaine
I can be the sunshine
Shining through the rain
Let me be the wine addiction
Running in your veins
You don't have to hurt no more
Baby, I can ease your pain
Baby, I can ease your pain
I can't read your mind
Girl it's up to you
We could take the edge off
If that's what you wanna do
Bring your misery
And lay it all on me
You don't need no 100 proof
Baby I
I can be the shot of whiskey
Your memory novocaine
I can be the sunshine
Shining through the rain
Let me be the wine addiction
Running in your veins
You don't have to hurt no more
Baby, I can ease your pain
Baby, I can ease your pain
Come on, let me fix you up
Let me be your favourite drug
Come on, let me fix you up
Let me be your favourite drug
Come on, let me fix you up
Let me be your favourite drug
Come on, let me fix you up
Baby I
I can be the shot of whiskey
Your memory novocaine
I can be the sunshine
Shining through the rain
Let me be the wine addiction
Running in your veins
You don't have to hurt no more
Baby, I can ease your pain
Baby, I can ease your pain
Baby, I can ease your pain
Baby, I can ease your pain
