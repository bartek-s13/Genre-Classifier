Streetlight buzzin' on the corner
Barely breakin' up the dark
You slip your hand into my backpocket
Outside of Murphy's Bar

Street player playin' on a six string
Drop a five in his jar
Couldn't tell you the song he's playin'
But you fall right in my arms

Oo-oo-ooh, dancin' underneath the stars
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh, dancin' on the boulevard

Spin you 'round on the sidewalk
You pull the chain on my neon heart
There's no one else in the world right now but us
Right where we are

Oo-oo-ooh, dancin' underneath the stars
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh, dancin' on the boulevard


People say love is crazy
You never know when you're gonna fall hard
I guess for me, never thought it'd be
Dancin' on the boulevard

Oo-oo-ooh, dancin' underneath the stars
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh, dancin' on the boulevard
Oo-oo-ooh, dancin' underneath the stars
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh, dancin' on the boulevard

Oh, dancin' on the boulevard
Oh, dancin' on the boulevard
