Breathe in, breath out
I never said that I was done
Believing you'd come around
Been holding out, been holding out for ya
My head screams to let go
But these dreams are tangled up in you
Maybe I said too much
Am I a little too much?

If You're the waves I dive in 'til I hit the ocean floor
Is it a world worth dying  fighting till im yours?
I wanna feel more than I imagine
Something gonna happen between us
Don't know what's real
Now I'm in the deep end, it's got me thinking
Was it all in my head?

Take in the high road
Before I knew which way to turn
Breaking what's already broke
Been holding on, still holding on to you
I shut out the echoes
To let in another piece of you
Maybe I care too much
Maybe a little too much

You are the waves I dive in 'til I hit the ocean floor
But what's a world worth fighting if I can't be yours?
I wanna feel more than I imagine
Something gonna happen between us
Don't know what's real
Now I'm in the deep end, it's got me thinking
Was it all in my head?

Was it all in my head?
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah
All in my head?
H-head, h-head, oh yeah
