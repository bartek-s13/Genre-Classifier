OLD DAN TUCKER
Traditional
Old Dan Tucker's a fine old man Washed his face in a fryin' pan Combed his hair with a wagon wheel And died with a toothache in his heel Hey get outa the way, old Dan Tucker Too late to get your supper. Supper's over and dinner's cookin', an' Ol' Dan Tucker jus' stand there lookin'. Now old Dan Tucker is come to town Riding a billy goat leadin' a hound The hound dog bark and the billy goat jump Sent Ol' Dan Tucker right straddle of a stump * Refrain Now old Dan Tucker he got drunk Fell in the fire and kicked up a chunk Gotta live coal in his shoe And oh my lawd how the ashes flew * Refrain Now old Dan Tucker is come to town Swinging the ladies round and round First to the right and then to the left Then to the girl that he loves best * Refrain
