Well I work for the city in the town where I grew up
Some days I run a backhoe some days I run a dump
If I had other plans on my graduation day
Then several years ago I guess I hauled 'em all away
Yeah I hauled 'em all away
She told me she was pregnant on the day I turned 18
I did what your supposed to do. I bought her a ring
He didn't have to ask us, but he asked us anyway
We stood up and said, "I do." what else were we gonna say?
What else were we gonna say?
Well I'm thankful for the things I have
And all the things I don't
And I've got dreams that will come true
And I've got some that won't
Most the time I just walk the line wherever it goes
'Cuz you can't hang yourself if you ain't got enough rope
My boss man is the Mayor. I do just what he asks
I mow the courthouse lawn, watch the prisoners walkin' past
I'm happy to be working, instead of wearin' chains
Like my cousin Willy, he's locked up in La Grange
He's locked up in La Grange
But I'm thankful for the things I have
And all the things I don't
And I've got dreams that will come true
I've got some that won't
Most the time I just walk the line wherever it goes
'Cuz you can't hang yourself if you ain't got enough rope
There's a tavern down the highway, I go to drink some beers
And wash down all I'm missin' by hangin' around here
Then I drive back to the trailer; I'll makeup with my wife
I kiss my sleeping children, and I get on with my life
Yeah I get on with my life
