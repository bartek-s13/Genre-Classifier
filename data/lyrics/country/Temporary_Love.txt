Ginny come lately but she's gone by the morning in the blink of an eye (blink of an eye)
Show up every night, here without a warning, have a damn good time
I’m the one to blame, it's a crying shame, need to walk away
One foot in one foot out the door
You just want me when you want me
I don’t want it no more
No use in getting high it’s only keeping me down
There's nothing left to use I’m done fooling around with
Temporary Love, don’t want it
Temporary Love
Had me a little too much, here baby, of your temporary love
Everybody knows it only takes a little dose to leave you hypnotized
So the story goes it’s hard to shake the habit of her kiss goodbye
I’m the one to blame, it's a crying shame, need to walk away
One foot in one foot out the door
You just want me when you want me
I don’t want it no more
No use in getting high it’s only keeping me down
There's nothing left to use, I’m done fooling around with
Temporary Love, don’t want it
Temporary Love
Had me a little too much, here baby, of your temporary love
(wohohoh, wohohoh)
I danced with Mary Jane
Spent some time with Ginger
Took a trip with Lucy out to Cali for the winter
I’m ready for the long haul, settle down with her
I’d rather spend my money on a ring for her finger
Temporary Love don’t want it (don’t want it)
Temporary Love (don’t want lovin if its part time)
Had me a little too much, here baby, (too much) of your temporary love (just a temporary love)
Temporary Love, don’t want it (don’t want it)
Temporary Love (Wohohoh)
Had me a little too much, here baby, (too much) of your temporary love
