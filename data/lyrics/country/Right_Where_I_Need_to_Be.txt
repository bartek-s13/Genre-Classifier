There's a plane flying out of here tonight
Destination New Orleans
Boss man says my big promotion's on the line
He says that's right where I need to be
Lately I've been on the road more than I've been home
All this leaving her alone is killing me
And holding her right now has got me thinkin' more and more
This is right where I need to be

Where when I hear her I can see her
I can smell her sweet perfume
I can feel her skin against me when I sleep
Where I won't miss her I can kiss her
Anytime that I want to
Yeah that's right where I need to be
Yeah that's right where I need to be

There's a plane flying out of here tonight
With an empty first class seat
Because I've finally got all my priorities in line
And I'm right where I need to be

Where when I hear her I can see her
I can smell her sweet perfume
I can feel her skin against me when I sleep
Where I won't miss her I can kiss her
Anytime that I want to
Yeah that's right where I need to be
Yeah that's right where I need to be
