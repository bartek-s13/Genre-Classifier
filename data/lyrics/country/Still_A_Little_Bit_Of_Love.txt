When I saw you there at the party tonight
With a smile so pretty and your eyes so bright
I wondered why if you ever said goodbye
Was it the hand of faith was it just bad luck
Maybe we didn't try enough at it all these time
I still don't know why
'Cause there's still a little bit of love
Still a little bit of love
Still a little bit of love come shinning through
'Cause there's still a little bit of love
Still a little bit of love
Is there still a little bit of love in me and you
Now the years have passed and a change has come
We thought those two young lovers were done
But it seems some dream won't fade away with time
And a taste of love is a dangerous thing
And is sweet beyond imagining
And I've never found, never found a love like yours and mine
And it seems it all the changes of our lives
The promise to this moment to get them here tonight
