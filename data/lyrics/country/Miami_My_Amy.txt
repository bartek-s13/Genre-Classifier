Well everybody talks about the California quakes
But the first time I ever felt the earth shake was in Miami
When Amy touched me ah, it shook me
I told her I loved her and I wanted to stay
But she said "be sure and I'll call you in L. A."
Even in the taxi I could hear my telephone ring

Calling me from Miami, my Amy
What took you so long, I thought you'd never call
Miami, my Amy
Miami, my Amy loved me after all

Now Amy just called and said, "please come back"
Said "I'm on my way babe, I ain't even unpacked"
"I want you, I love you," that's all she had to say
Goodbye L. A., now once again I'm Miami bound
Can't wait 'til this plane touches down
Because I know my Amy will be waiting at that Miami gate

I can't wait, Miami, my Amy
What took you so long, I thought you'd never call
Miami, oh my Amy
Miami, my Amy loves me after all
Miami, my Amy loves me after all
