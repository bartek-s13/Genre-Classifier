I've got a bright red sticker on the back of my car
Says: "United States Marines."
An' yesterday a lady in a mini-van
Held up her middle finger at me
Does she think she knows what I stand for
Or the things that I believe?
Just by looking at a sticker for the US Marines
On the bumper of my S.U.V
See, my brother Chris, he's been in
For more than 14 years now
Our Dad was in the Navy during Vietnam
Did his duty, then he got out
And my Grandpa earned his Purple Heart
On the beach of Normandy
That's why I've got a sticker for the US Marines
On the bumper of my S.U.V
But that doesn't mean that I want war:
I'm not Republican or Democrat
But I've gone all around this crazy world
Just to try to better understand
An' yes, I do have questions:
I get to ask them because I'm free
That's why I've got a sticker for the US Marines
On the bumper of my S.U.V
'Cause I've been to Hiroshima
An' I've been to the DMZ
I've walked on the sand in Baghdad
Still don't have all of the answers I need
But I guess I wanna know where she's been
Before she judges and gestures to me
'Cause she don't like my sticker for the US Marines
On the bumper of my S.U.V
So I hope that lady in her mini-van
Turns on her radio and hears this from me
As she picks up her kids
From their private school
An' drives home safely on our city streets
Or to the building where her church group meets:
Yeah, that's why I've got a sticker for the US Marines
On the bumper of my S.U.V
