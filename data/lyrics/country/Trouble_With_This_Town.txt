See that park bench and that streetlight
Had our first kiss and our first fight
And through that doorway there's a cafe
Every Sunday, yeah, that was our place

And that's the trouble with this town
When I go out
It's everywhere I go, everywhere I look
Stuck in it uptown, merry-go-round
I'm hanging on a neon heart
Nowhere to hide and there's nowhere to run
I wanna be over him and done
He's still out there kicking my heart around
And that's the trouble with this town
Yeah, that's the trouble with this town, yeah

If you turn left down on third street
There's a motel, yeah, that's where they'd meet
All the secrets that you can't keep
Keep on talkin' through the concrete

And that's the trouble with this town
When I go out
It's everywhere I go, everywhere I look
Stuck in it up, merry-go-round
I'm hanging on a neon heart
Nowhere to hide and there's nowhere to run
I wanna be over him and done
But he's still out there kicking my heart around
That's the trouble with this town
Yei-yeah
That's the trouble with this town

Nowhere to hide and there's nowhere to run
I wanna be over him and done
Nowhere to hide and there's nowhere to run
I wanna be over him and done

And that's the trouble with this town
When I go out
It's everywhere I go, everywhere I look
Stuck in it uptown, merry-go-round
I'm hanging on a neon heart
Nowhere to hide and there's nowhere to run
I wanna be over him and done
But he's still out there kicking my heart around
That's the trouble with this town
Yei-yeah
That's the trouble with this town
