We're still hangin' in there ain't we Jessi?
Though the others just fell by the way
We're still hangin' in there ain't we Jessi?
But are you sure Audrey done it this way?

Jan couldn't live with big Harlon
Tammy finally gave up on Jones
But we still got ol' Hank and ol' Waylin
Course that's almost like being alone

We're still hangin' in there ain't we Jessi?
Though the others just fell by the way
We're still hangin' in there ain't we Jessi?
But are you sure Audrey done it this way?

Dotty traded Bill for a drummer
Who knows what Sammy's looking for
But Jessi you're the third one, you're the charmer
As of this writing I'm Mrs.The Fourth

But we're still hangin' in there ain't we Jessi?
Though the others just fell by the way
We're still hangin' in there ain't we Jessi?
But are you sure Audrey done it this way?
We're still hangin' in there ain't we Jeannie?
Though the others just fell by the way
We're still hangin' in there ain't we Jeannie?
But are you sure Audrey done it this way?
