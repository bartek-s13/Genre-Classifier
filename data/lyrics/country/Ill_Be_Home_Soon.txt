You call me up
You ain't even gotta say a single word, I already know
It's been one of those days, honey
Something's got ya stirred up
Weighing down like an anchor that ya gotta drag around, but I know
Just what you need

I'll be home soon
To kiss away the world, burn your troubles down
I'm gonna make you forget
When I'm holding you
There's only room for us, nothing else allowed
Tell all your worries there ain't much time left
It's time to go, 'cause I'll be home soon

Yeah, I'm running reds
So I can run my fingers through your hair
Girl, I can feel it now
And I'm coming for you, honey
You can lay it on me every care
Baby fall and I'll be there to catch you
I'm on my way

And I'll be home soon
To kiss away the world, burn your troubles down
I'm gonna make you forget
When I'm holding you
There's only room for us, nothing else allowed
Tell all your worries there ain't much time left
It's time to go, 'cause I'll be home soon


I'll be home soon

I'm gonna make you forget
When I'm holding you
There's only room for us, nothing else allowed
Tell all your worries there ain't much time left
It's time to go, 'cause I'll be home soon
I'll be home soon
