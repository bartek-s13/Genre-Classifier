There's a shadow above this house
It screams louder when I go out
It knows my name and all my fears
Although when the suns out it disappears
Oh it taunts me, in my dreams it haunts me
Oh it stalks me when I'm alone
As I look over my shoulder, it's standing in the mirror
But it don't say a word, 'cause it knows
You ask me twice, what is my name?
I hear it screaming it out from miles away
You never cared much about my pain
But you'll feel it someday
Oh it taunts me, in my dreams it haunts me
Oh it stalks me when I'm alone
As I look over my shoulder, it's standing in the mirror
But it don't say a word, 'cause it knows
Calypso, my dear
Hush now, do as I've done
Don't make a sound
Oh it taunts me, in my dreams it haunts me
Oh it stalks me when I'm alone
As I look over my shoulder, it's standing in the mirror
But it don't say a word
No it don't say a word
