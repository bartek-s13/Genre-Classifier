Well I met her out at Murphy's Resturaunt
She said she was fresh from the farm
And I remember thinkin' for a country girl
That she went pretty well armed
We sat there talkin by the lobster tank
I ordered her a sloe gin fizz
And when them chicken fried streaks arrived
She said "I like livin like this..."

So I made her the Queen of my double wide trailer
With the polyester curtains and the red wood deck
Now she's run off and I've got to trail her
Dang her black heart and her pretty redneck
Well a few nights later I run into her
With some stranger on a park bench
She said "He rebuilds engines and his name is Earl
He's the Charlie Daniels of the torque wrench."
I whispered "honey, let's just go on home
And and have some onion rings and watch T.V."
And as I walked her to the truck
Earl was cryin "Don't you leave me"

This here's the Queen of my double wide trailer
With the polyester curtains and the red wood deck
Now she's run off and I've got to trail her
Dang her black heart and her pretty redneck
This here's the Queen of my double wide trailer
With the polyester curtains and the red wood deck
Now she's run off and I've got to trail her
Dang her black heart and her pretty redneck
This here's the Queen of my double wide trailer
With the polyester curtains and the red wood deck
Now she's run off and I've got to trail her
Dang her black heart and her pretty redneck

She's the queen
She's the queen
