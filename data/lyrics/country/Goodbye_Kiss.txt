It started with a goodbye kiss
I shoulda just walked right out that door
Then I wouldn't be sittin' here drinkin'
Thinkin' 'bout a bet, I want just one more
Then she woulda told me that
You never loved me anyway
Then I might be in just a little bit better shape

Shoulda never turned around
Looked you in the eye
Girl, you know it ain't fair
That stare cuts me like a knife
Shoulda kept my hands in my pockets
So I didn't have to give you one last hug
Maybe then I wouldn't be so fucked up

Goodbye means goodbye
No, not see you around from time to time
And I know you hate to see me cry
But goodbye means goodbye

Lovin' somebody shouldn't have to be, a means to an end
Maybe it was just lust, we're better off as friends
I just can't get that last kiss off my mind

But goodbye means goodbye
Oh, no, no, well
Goodbye means goodbye
No, not see you around from time to time
And I know you hate to see me cry
But goodbye means goodbye
Oh, and goodbye means goodbye

Started with a goodbye kiss
I shoulda just walked right out that door
