Closing in on too late 30
Better get home, gotta hit it hard early

Sayin', 'look, gonna call it a night now'
But you're all wrapped up in the right now

But her smile is saying 'why can't you?'
Gonna wind up staying there, ain't ya?

Another shot of that Fireball Whiskey
Tomorrow this night's gonna own me
No reason to go home lonely
