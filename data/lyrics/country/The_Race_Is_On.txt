I feel tears wellin' up cold deep inside
Like my heart's sprung a big break
And a stab of lonliness sharp and painful
That I may never shake
You might say that I was taking it hard
Since you wrote me off with a call
But don't you wager that I'll hide in sorrow
When I may lay right down and bawl

Now the race is on
And here comes pride in the backstretch
Heartaches goin' to the inside
My tears are holdin' back
They're tryin' not to fall
My hearts out of the runnin'
True love's scratched for another's sake
The race is on and it looks like heartache
And the winner loses all

One day I ventured in love
Never once suspectin' what the final result would be
And how I lived in fear of waking up each morning
Finding that you're gone from me
There's ache and pain in my heart
For today was the one that I hated to face
Somebody new came up to win her
And I came out in second place

Now the race is on
And here comes pride in the backstretch
Heartaches goin' to the inside
My tears are holdin' back
They're tryin' not to fall
My hearts out of the runnin'
True love's scratched for another's sake
The race is on and it looks like heartache
And the winner loses all

Now the race is on
And here comes pride in the backstretch
Heartaches goin' to the inside
My tears are holdin' back
They're tryin' not to fall
My hearts out of the runnin'
True love's scratched for another's sake
The race is on and it looks like heartache
And the winner loses all
The winner loses all
