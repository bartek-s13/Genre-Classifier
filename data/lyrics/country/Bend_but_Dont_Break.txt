Bend but don't break give before you take
Always look 'em right in the eye
These are words to live by
Jim proposed to Sue she said I do
They eloped into a summer's night
Heading for Loredo that's the way wind blew
They got in their first real fight
Standing at the alter shoes and her halter
Jim sweating out his Sunday best
Looking all around them but nobody found them
And this is what the preacher said
Chorus:
Bend but don't break give before you take
Always look 'em right in the eye
Always have a reason dress right for the season
Never cheat and never lie
These are words to live by
Billy's washing dishes and all the time he wishes he could find a better way
Yea and no season had rain for a country singer bound for a life of that fortune and fame
He wrote a couple songs and they got a long into the hands of a bad Nashville man
Playin' on the radio and he ain't never seen no doe
Looks back down at them ugly pots and pans
Repeat Chorus
Bridge:
You know times in our life are nervous and reckless, sometimes it's hard just to get by
Ain't it good to know that we can still grow So gimme one word and tell me one time
Always me and mother and never were no other Daddy died when I was just three
Always understood that she did the best she could I needed someone right there Momma would be
I never thought twice to ask for advice when I got crazy in my head
What ever the cause she would slowly pause And this is what Momma said
Repeat Chorus
