Tied a little silk strap
Falling off your shoulder
If only I could make time
I'd move a little slower
I'd lay back and watch you as you move
And float across the room

Baby you turn me on
I lose my head and end up lost a thousand different ways
One look is more than enough
To make me want to grab you up and take your breath away
I just can't help myself
Baby you turn me on like nothing else

Here you go again girl
Taking me with you
You know you can move me
Anytime you want to
I always do my best to play it cool
But girl there ain't no use

Just a taste of your kiss
The soft of your touch
That look in your eyes
When you're looking at mine
Baby it means so much
