They got a vintage Victrola 1951
Full of my favorite records that I grew up on
They got ole Hank and Lefty and there's B24
Set 'em up Joe, and play 'Walking The Floor'
Set 'em up Joe, and play 'Walking The Floor'
I'm gonna spend the night like every night before
Playin' ET and I'll play him some more
I've gotta have a shot of them old troubadours
Set 'em up Joe, and play 'Walking The Floor'
Set 'em up Joe, and play 'Walking The Floor'
All my neon neighbors they like what I play
Cause they've heard it every night since you've walked away
Every day they replace old B24
'Cause every night I run a needle through 'Walking The Floor'
Every night I run a needle through 'Walking The Floor'
I'm gonna spend the night like every night before
Playin' ET and I'll play him some more
I've gotta have a shot of them old troubadours
Set 'em up Joe, and play 'Walking The Floor'
Set 'em up Joe, and play 'Walking The Floor'
I said set 'em up Joe, and play 'Walking The Floor'
