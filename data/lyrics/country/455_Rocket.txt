Mr. Smith had an Oldsmobile
Baby blue with them wire wheels
I took her home the day that she was advertised
He said she leaked when it would rain
Sounded like an aeroplane
But I knew she was jewel in disguise
She had a 455 rocket
The biggest block alive
Couldn't hardly wait just to take my turn
She was made for the straight aways
She grew up hating Chevrolets
She's a rocket
She was made to burn
Well, whose junk pile piece of Chevelle is this?
You boys come here to race or just kiss?
Mmm now don't ya want to know what I got underneath my hood?
I know she might sound like she's missin'
But buddy, she could teach you a lesson
In just a quarter mile, and I'll smoke you good
In my 455 rocket
The kind the police drive
I couldn't hardly wait just to take my turn
She was made for the straight aways
She grew up hating Chevrolets
She's a rocket
She was made to burn
I'm telling you and I ain't ashamed
I cried when that wrecker came
As we skid I thought I heard the angels sing
Sounded like the Beach Boys
We hit the curb and began to sail
Took out most of the safety rail
Even the cop asked me, "Man what'd you have in that thing?"
I had a 455 rocket
The very kind you drive
You oughta watch yourself when you take that turn
She was made for the straight aways
She grew up hating Chevrolets
She's a rocket, she was made to burn, burn
Ohh she's a rocket, she was made to burn
