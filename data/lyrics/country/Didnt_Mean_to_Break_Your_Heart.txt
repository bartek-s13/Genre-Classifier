When I said that I loved you I mean it with all my heart
I know you don’t believe me, the way I tore your world apart
Can’t blame you for leaving me, ‘though it took me by surprise
And nowadays when you hear my name, I hope that it makes you smile
I guess you were tired of being lonely
You were tired of being blue
You were tired of all my lies, baby
I was tired to lying to you
Doesn’t mean that I didn’t love you
I was lost when I held your hand
And I never mean to break your heart
I hope you understand
And we were just two kids then and I was scared of love
You gave me your everything, darling, and I just screwed us up
We could’ve been the best, babe, if you would’ve stayed with me
Well, but I was so damn different and you’re too good for me
I guess you were tired of being lonely
You were tired of being blue
You were tired of all my lies, baby
I was tired to lying to you
Doesn’t mean that I didn’t love you
I was lost when I held your hand
And I never mean to break your heart
I hope you understand
Whoa, baby, I’m sorry for what I’ve done
Whoa, darling, in my heart, you’re still the one
I guess you were tired of being lonely
You were tired of being blue
You were tired of all my lies, baby
I was tired to lying to you
Doesn’t mean that I didn’t love you
I was lost when I held your hand
And I never meant to break your heart
I hope you understand
And I never meant to break your heart
I hope you understand
I hope you understand
