Copenhagen it makes me feel so good
Copenhagen the way I know it should
I put a little chew in my mouth
Go spittin' and a-slobberin'
All around the house, that
Copenhagen, it makes me feel so good
I took a chew just the other night-
It made me feel so fine
I Grabbed my honey baby
And I pinched her ol' behind
She said, "you better spit out that
Chewin' tobaccer if you wanna kiss
Me on the big ol' smacker
That Copenhagen, it makes me feel so good
Copenhagen it makes me feel so good
Copenhagen the way I know it should
I put a little chew in my mouth
Go spittin' and a-slobberin'
All around the house, that
Copenhagen, it makes me feel so good
I was sittin' in a bar room
And I took a little dip--
Drinkin' beer and talkin'
But I had no place to spit
So I spit a stream out on the floor
And that bouncer flung me out the door
That Copenhagen, it makes me feel so good
Copenhagen it makes me feel so good
Copenhagen the way I know it should
I put a little chew in my mouth
Go spittin' and a-slobberin'
All around the house, that
Copenhagen, it makes me feel so good
It's a cure all too-
It cures fits, warts, freckles, coughs
Colds, runny nose
Guaranteed not to rip, run or snag
Makes conception a wonder and
Child birth a pleasure...
That's Copenhagen, makes me feel so good!
