Well my face is gettin' redder as my liver swells
In a livin' hell
In a livin' hell
Well, I'm down in the gutter and I'm startin' to smell

Kicked around
Drink it up
To bad luck
I been put down
Kicked around
Drink it up
To bad luck
In a livin' hell
In a livin' hell
Hey I ain't makin' no money cause my records don't sell
In a livin' hell
In a livin' hell
Well my girlfriend's sucking d***s at the Taco Bell
I been put down
Kicked around
Drink it up
To bad luck
I been put down
Kicked around
Drink it up
To bad luck
In a livin' hell
In a livin' hell
Well now I'm eatin' p**** at the Sheraton Hotel
In a livin' hell
In a livin' hell
Well you know I love you baby but woohee that smell
I been put down
Kicked around
Drink it up
To bad luck
I been put down
Kicked around
Drink it up
To bad luck
In a livin' hell
