I could think about shotgun, ridin' in silence
Looking out the window to keep me from cryin’
I could think about tail-lights burning bright red
Hittin' the stop sign and watchin' you turn left
I could think about goodbye, forget all the good stuff
But when I see your truck, all I can think of...
Is a backroad, breaking curfew, I was smiling and climbing out the sun roof
You were laughing, driving too fast
Hoping the blue lights wouldn’t light up the rearview
We were crazy, we were stupid, never
Thought about what we were doing
But you loved me, and I love you too
That's what I think about when I think about you
I could think about the boardwalk in September
Used to be our spot til I saw you with her
I could think about your blue eyes or her blonde hair
And wonder how you could ever take her there
I could think about the hurt, forget all the memories
But when I'm back at the beach, all I see...
Is the moonlight on your skin, taking my hand, running and jumping in
While the waves crash, over our heads
We were kissing and wishing it would never end
We were crazy, we were stupid, never
Thought about what we were doing
But you loved me and I loved you too
That's what I think about when I think about you
I could think about my heart and how you still have it
And how much I want to hate you, but that'll never happen
When all I see is Is a backroad, breaking curfew, I was smiling
And climbing out the sun roof
You were laughing, driving too fast
Hoping the blue lights wouldn't light up the rearview
I see the moonlight on your skin, taking my hand, running and jumping in
While the waves crash, over our heads
We were kissing and wishing it would never end
We were crazy, we were stupid, never
Thought about what we were doing
But you loved me and I loved you too
That's what I think about when I think about you
Yeah, that's what I think about when I think about...you
