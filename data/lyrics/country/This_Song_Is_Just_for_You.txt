Of all the songs the world is singing of dreams that do and don't come true
I guess I've sung about a million but darling this one's just for you
I don't care if the world can't hear it playing if it's never number one or two
I just want to tell how much I love you so darling this song's just for you
What do they care about my troubles if my whole world suddenly falls through
You'll be the one who'll stand beside me so darling this song's just for you
