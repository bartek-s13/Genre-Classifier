I will take your hands, put it in mine
Take that key, put it in drive
Drive all night out to no man's land
Draw our names, in the desert sand

No reservation
No-no hesitation
Just you and me, memory makin'

Do you believe that this ain't meant to be?
Follow this feeling, come find it with me
We're dreaming, we're chasing
Memory makin'

Tonight is gonna be an 8x10, black and white
Burning so beautiful in my mind
So crazy, messed-up that it works
Gonna want so badly that it hurts

Baby, we're diamonds
You know that we're timeless
Our hearts are waiting, on memory makin'

Do you believe that this ain't meant to be?
Follow this feeling, come find it with me
We're dreaming, we're chasing
Memory makin'

Bottle up the moment
Livin' like you own it
Writing our story
Yeah-ehh, yea-ehh
Bottle up the moment
Livin' like you own it
Writing our story
Yeah-ehh, yea-ehh

Do you believe that this ain't meant to be?
Follow this feeling, come find it with me
We're dreaming, we're chasing
Memory makin'
