Wrapped in my arms, holdin' you tight
I ain't lettin' go, baby, let's take all night
After all of this time, it still feels so right
Baby, you and I

I still want you, need you
You're my I can't drive fast enough
To get home to, get to lovin' you
Yeah, don't you know you still get to me
Weak in the knees, can't barely breathe
And you ain't tryin' at all
I still fall

Every kiss, every touch
You on my skin, I still feel so much
I'm still so in love

I still want you, need you
You're my I can't drive fast enough
To get home to, get to lovin' you
Yeah, don't you know you still get to me
Weak in the knees, can't barely breathe
When you ain't tryin' at all
I still

Fall for the little things
Like the smile that you're givin' me
Just one look and I'm gone

I still want you, need you
You're my I can't drive fast enough
To get home to, get to lovin' you
Yeah, don't you know you still get to me
Weak in the knees, can't barely breathe
When you ain't tryin' at all
I still, I still fall
