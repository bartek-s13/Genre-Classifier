I’m headed for the lowlands, would you, please, direct my way ?
The train is leaving shortly, there’s no time for delay
She told me she’d be waiting, I’m not so sure she is
I heard that there’s another man who claims that she is his
The lowlands were my home when I was but a child
They will be my deathbed when I’ve past my time
I remember one summer day, the clouds began to build
We gathered the cattle that had scattered ‘cross the fields
Well, it started to rain and continued several days
The river overflowed and the crops all went to waste
The lowlands were my home when I was but a child
They will be my deathbed when I’ve past my time
You know that I’m no failure though my victories are few
I’m trying my best but there’s too much here to do
That girl I love once told me I made here feel secure
It’s hard to think I’ve been replaced., nothing does endure
The lowlands were my home when I was but a child
They will be my deathbed when I’ve past my time
