I meant to be the girl that keeps it all together
I’ve never been the one to settle for whatever
Always tryna find a way to make it better
Oh-oh-oh
They say you gotta make the most of every minute
And the measure of the day is what you’re fittin’ in it
But sometimes I just wanna relax
And let go-oh-oh

So what’s the point of being a little straight
When we can just get a little bent
Come on come on what are we waiting for

Maybe it’s about time we got busy doing nothing
Crazy I just found life
Just busy doing nothing
When it feels like enough is enough
And you keep giving to much of yourself and
Maybe it’s about time we got busy doing nothing

Jumped in the car to go out without a reason
Laid on the floor making shadows on the ceiling
Or painting stars in the sky like i’m dreaming
Oh-oh-oh
Go out at night and kiss my friend at the cabin
A girl party up and my parents thinks me in my bed at
Build a house out of cards and then tearing it
Down down down

What’s the point of being a little straight
When we can just get a little bent
Come on come on what are we waiting for

Maybe it’s about time we got busy doing nothing
Crazy I just found life
Just busy doing nothing
When it feels like enough is enough
And you keep giving to much of yourself and
Maybe it’s about time
We got busy doing nothing
Busy doing nothing
Busy doing nothing
Maybe it’s about time we got busy doing nothing

I meant to be the girl that keeps it all together
I’ve never been the one to settle for whatever
But now I’m like whatever
Maybe it’s about time we got busy doing nothing
Crazy I just found life
Just busy doing nothing
When it feels like enough is enough
And you keep giving to much of yourself and
Maybe it’s about time we got busy doing nothing
Busy doing nothing
Busy doing nothing
Maybe it’s about time we got busy doing nothing
What’s the point of being a little straight
When we can just get a little bent
Come on come on what are we waiting for
Get busy doing nothing
What’s the point of being a little straight
When we can just get a little bent
Maybe it’s about time
We got busy doing nothing
