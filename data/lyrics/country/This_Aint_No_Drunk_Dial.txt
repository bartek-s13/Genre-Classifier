Girl, don't hang up
I called on purpose
Yeah, I've had a few
Hell, I'm hurting
Our song came on the radio
I could hear you singing along
So I took the long way home
So I could listen to it all

Sounds like
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
It sounds like
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
This ain't no drunk dial
Ain't no words that I'm forgetting
In the morning
Still mean everything I said
I know it's late and I ain't called in awhile
But this ain't no drunk dial

We ain't got to talk about what happened
But I'll take the blame
If you want me to have it
Somewhere in this full moon night
There's a way to make this whole thing right
If you leave the front door open
I'll be there before you know it
This ain't no drunk dial
Ain't no words that I'll forget
In the morning
Still mean everything I said
I know it's late
And I ain't called in a while
But this ain't no drunk dial
This ain't no drunk dial

This ain't courage from a bottle
It's just one last shot to give it all we got, yeah

Sounds like
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
It sounds like
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
But this ain't no drunk dial
Ain't no words that I'll forget
In the morning
Still mean everything I said
I know it's late
And I ain't called in a while
But this ain't no drunk dial
This ain't no drunk dial
This ain't no drunk dial
This ain't no drunk dial
It sounds like
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
