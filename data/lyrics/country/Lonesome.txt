I pulled your phone call down off the plain white wall in my living room
You say you miss me and you don't want to hurt me
But baby that's all you do
This is some kind, some kind of crazy
I'm going over the edge without you baby
You're my favorite kind of lonesome
There's something that I need when the nights get long
You're the kiss I wanna steal
The love I wanna feel
The only one I wanna cry for
My favorite kind of lonesome
I bet your pretty blue eyes are catching everyone's smile down on Broadway
I know they say they need you girl
But you gotta tell me when you're coming my way
This is some kind, some kind of crazy
I'm going over the edge without you baby
You're my favorite kind of lonesome
There's something that I need when the nights get long
You're the kiss I wanna steal
The love I wanna feel
The only one I wanna cry for
My favorite kind of lonesome
This is some kind, some kind of crazy
Im going over the edge without you baby
You're my favorite kind of
My favorite kind of lonesome
There's something that I need when the nights get long
You're the kiss I wanna steal
The love I wanna feel
The only one I wanna cry for
My favorite kind of lonesome
You're my favorite kind of lonesome, yeaaaa!
