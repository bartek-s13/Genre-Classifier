In our corner of that diner
Where the coffee’s thick like mud
For a minute or for the morning
Anything will be enough
If you’ll just say you’ll be next to me
Even on the coldest day we’ll ever know
Just stay next to me
Next to me forever, please don’t go
If the world starts comin’ at me
And my armor rattles loose
If my compass starts to spinnin’
Tell me, can I count on you
To say you’ll stay next to me
Even on the darkest days we’ll know
Just stay next to me
Next to me forever, please don’t go
God I love this very moment
When the moon welcomes the sun
And we haven’t been to sleep yet
How you make me come undone
Baby, stay next to me
Yeah you’re the sweetest love I’ve ever known
Just stay next to me
Next to me forever, don’t let go
