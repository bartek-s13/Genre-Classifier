Girl hop in
Roll down the window
We’ll find us some good country radio
Drive down a dirt road till it ends
Put your feet up on the dashboard
That’s what that thing was made for
Lean over and give me a big ol’ kiss
I swear the way you do it
Your love is like country music

So come on girl turn it up
Blow them speakers right out of my truck
Oh i can’t get enough
I can spend all night grooving to
Your sweet carolina southern drawl
Like an old Don Wiliams song
I lean back, listen to it
Your love is like country music
Woah oh, woah oh
Yeah yeah

Let’s stop here
Drink in the moonlight
Get out there and dance in the head lights
You can hold on to me all night long
I want to feel your warmth by the sway
To every tune the dj is playing
Somebody oughta put you in a song
I swear the way you do it
Your love is like country music
So come on girl turn it up
Blow them speakers right out of my truck
Oh i can’t get enough
I can spend all night grooving to
Your sweet carolina southern drawl
Like an old Don Wiliams song
I lean back, listen to it
Your love is like country music
Oh yeah

I can get lost here in your arms
Carried away on a steel guitar
Like a song stuck in my heart
Playing on and on and on

Come on girl turn it up
Blow them speakers right out of my truck
Oh i can’t get enough
I can spend all night grooving to
Your sweet carolina southern drawl
Like an old Don Wiliams song
I lean back, listen to it
Your love is like country music
Woah oh, woah oh
Yeah yeah
Woah oh girl I love when you do it
Woah oh, woah oh
Yeah yeah
