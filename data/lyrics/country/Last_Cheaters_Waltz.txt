She's going to pieces
When he walked in the door
She just has to see him
She can't wait no more
Tonight she'll be with him
No matter the cost
As the band plays
The Last Cheater's Waltz
And uh, huh, huh, don't they play lonely
Uh, huh, huh, don't they play sad
And uh, huh, huh, drink water only
See how he holds her as the band plays
The Last Cheater's Waltz
He tells her he loves her
As the music plays on
He tells her he needs her
But someone's at home
The ball game's all over
And she knows she's lost
As the band plays
The Last Cheater's Waltz
And uh, huh, huh, don't they play lonely
Uh, huh, huh, don't they play sad
And uh, huh, huh, three quarter only
See how he holds her as the band plays
The Last Cheater's Waltz
And uh, huh, huh, don't they play lonely
Uh, huh, huh, don't they play sad
And uh, huh, huh, three quarter only
See how he holds her as the band plays
The Last Cheater's Waltz...
