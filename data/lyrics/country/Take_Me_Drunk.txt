Well if a drunk mans says what a sober man thinks
Then right now I think I'm thinkin' out loud a lot
Hey girl, you wanna split a shot?
Take me drunk, I'm home

Out here in the crowd can't hear a thing
Wait don't turn around, don't walk away
What I really meant to say was
Take me drunk, I'm home

What's a drink gotta do to get a guy in this bar?
I mean a girl in this bar
Somebody here take the car of my keys
Can't drive with these two hands oh and
Take me drunk, I'm home
Do it now

Well if a pig could fly do you really think a pig might fly
Through the front door of Club Klondike Lounge
Pick me up and drop me off at my house
Take me drunk, I'm home
Right at home on the barstool
Drinking like a half-lived legend alcoholic with a question mark
Liver floatin' like Noah's ark
Take me drunk, I'm home

What's a dance gotta do to get a girl in this place?
I mean a guy in this place
Somebody here take the car of my keys
Can't drive with these two hands oh and
Take me drunk, I'm home
Home, sweet home

What's a drink gotta do to get a guy in this bar?
I mean a girl in this bar
Somebody here take the car of my keys
Can't drive with these two hands oh and
Take me drunk, I'm home
C'mon
