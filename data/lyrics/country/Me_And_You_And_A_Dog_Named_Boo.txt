I remember to this day the bright red Georgia clay
And how it stuck to the tires after the summer rain
Will power made that old car go my roamin' mind told me that's so
How I wish that we were back on the road again
Me and you and a dog named Boo travelin' and a livin' off the land
Me and you and a dog named Boo how I love being a free man
I can still recall the wheatfields near St Paul
And in the mornin' we got caught robbin' from an old hen
Old MacDonald he made us work but then he paid us for what it was worth
Another tank of gas and back on the road again
Me and you and a dog named Boo...
I'll never forget that day we motored stately into big LA
The lights of the city put the settlin' down into my brain
It's only been a month or so that old car's a buggin' us to go
We gotta get away and get back on the road again
Me and you and a dog named Boo...
Me and you and a dog named Boo...
