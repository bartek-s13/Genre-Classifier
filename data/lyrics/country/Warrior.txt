She's tougher than she looks
Heart has a strong right hook
For all the hard times we went though
There's nothing she wouldn't do
For me and my baby sister
And that woman in that picture
Ain't just a woman in that picture
That's my mama, and I call her

A warrior, a fighter
The get-back-up-and-never-say-die-er
Keep on gettin' stronger
A hang in just a little bit longer
For every one step back
It's two steps forward
A warrior

Up before the sun
And prayin' to the one
That blessed her with patience and four kids
No doubt that's where my mama gets it
That blood in my mama's veins
She reminds me that it came
From the other woman in that picture
That's my grandma, and I call her

A warrior, a fighter
The get-back-up-and-never-say-die-er
Keep on gettin' stronger
A hang in just a little bit longer
For every one step back
It's two steps forward
A warrior

That blood is in my veins
I know that it came from a warrior
Hmm, ah yeah, a warrior
Oh yeah she's

A warrior, a fighter
The get-back-up-and-never-say-die-er
Keep on gettin' stronger
A hang in just a little bit longer
For every one step back
It's two steps forward
A warrior
