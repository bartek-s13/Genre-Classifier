Saw you when you walked out of that door
Of that seven light small town grocery store
Shining in the summer sun
Both arms full
Your face lights up when you see mine
Doors unlock inside of my mind
As the cans slip of the bottom of that paper sack
I laugh and say
Let me help you with that
And you say boy what are you doing
Here back in town
And I say
Checking on momma
Just hanging around
A couple days 'til I got to hit the road again
In my head I'm thinking it looks so good I can't help but stare
I'm lost in your perfume that's hanging in the air
With your blonde hair falling out from under your hat
I reach up and say let me help you with that
I'm packing that Chevy on River Ridge Road
And I'm kissing you baby, up against the silo
You're holding on tight saying don't you ever let me go
Don't ever let me go
I wipe that tear as it roles down your face
You look up, fake your best smile and say
Do you ever wish you could take the hands of time
And turn them back
I'd take your hand and say let me help you with that
I'm packing that Chevy on River Ridge Road
And I'm kissing you baby, up against the silo
You're holding on tight saying don't you ever let me go
Don't ever let me go
I say I bet I could find a couple extra days
If I had an excuse to miss that plane
One good reason to stay right where I'm at
You laugh and say let me help you with that
