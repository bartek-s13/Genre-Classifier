I was sitting there tearin' the label off a bottle of Bud
Waitin’ on my waiter to bring me my check so I could settle up 
Yeah I was gonna head on home, hit the couch and lay low 
Then you walked in, and all that went out the window 
I wasn't lookin' for a reason to be losin’ any sleep tonight
I wasn't lookin' to be catchin' a buzz off of your touch but baby I'm thinkin' I
I'm gonna change all of my plans and
Keep it right here where I am, yeah
Cuz you've got me wantin’ more of what I wasn’t lookin' for


Goin’ out of my mind every time you whisper in my ear 
You're bitin' your lip and movin' your hips and turnin’ every head in here 
Baby, you got somethin' that I, I didn't see comin', naw
I wasn't lookin' for a reason to be losin' any sleep tonight
I wasn't lookin' to be catchin' a buzz off of your touch but baby I'm thinkin' I
I'm gonna change all of my plans and
Keep it right here where I am, yeah
Cuz you've got me wantin' more of what I wasn't lookin' for


I guess I didn't
Know what I was missin', no
I wasn't lookin' for a reason to be losin' any sleep tonight, no
I wasn't lookin' to be catchin' a buzz off of your touch but baby I'm thinkin' I
I'm gonna change all of my plans and
Keep it right here where I am, yeah
Cuz you've got me wantin' more of what I wasn't lookin' for


Of what I wasn't lookin' for
