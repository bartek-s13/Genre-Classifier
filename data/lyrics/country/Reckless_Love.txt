Before I spoke a word, You were singing over me
You have been so, so good to me
Before I took a breath, You breathed Your life in me
You have been so, so kind to me

And oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God
Oh, it chases me down, fights 'til I’m found, leaves the ninety-nine
I couldn't earn it, and I don't deserve it, still, You give Yourself away
Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God

When I was Your foe, still Your love fought for me
You have been so, so good to me
When I felt no worth, You paid it all for me, yes, You did
You have been so, so kind to me

And oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God
Oh, it chases me down, fights ’til I'm found, leaves the ninety-nine
I couldn't earn it, and I don't deserve it, still, You give Yourself away
Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God
Oh-oh-ohh-ohhhh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-ohh
You found me

There's no shadow You won't light up
Mountain You won't climb up
Coming after me
There's no wall You won’t kick down
Lie You won’t tear down
Coming after me
There's no shadow You won’t light up (You won't light up)
Mountain You won't climb up (Mountain You won't climb up)
Coming after me (Coming after me, yeah)
There’s no wall You won't kick down
Lie You won't tear down
Coming after me, oh-oh-ohhh
There's no shadow You won't light up
Mountain You won't climb up
Coming after me, oh yeah (Coming after me, coming after me)
There's no wall You won't kick down
Lie You won't tear down
Coming after me

Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God
Oh, it chases me down, fights 'til I'm found, leaves the ninety-nine
I couldn't earn it, I don't deserve it, still, You give Yourself away
Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God

There's no shadow You won't light up
Mountain You won't climb up
Coming after me, oh no
There's no wall You won't kick down
Lie You won't tear down
Coming after me
There's no shadow You won't light up
Mountain You won't climb up
Coming after me, no
There's no wall You won't kick down
Lie You won't tear down
Coming after me
