I drink tequila straight
Haven't brushed my hair in days
And I'll kiss on the first date if I'm really feelin' it
I don't even own a dress
Bite my nails when I get stressed
Do whatever for attention if I'm needin' it

Controversial, so outspoken
I've been told I'm not ladylike

But I'm a lady, like woah
I could bring you to your knees and
Get you kicked out the Garden of Eden
Untamable, unframeable, Mona Lisa, oh
Kiss you like a whiskey fire
Turn around, leave your heart in a riot
Lipstick in a cigarette pack on the dash
I'm a lady like that

Sometimes I forget not to talk 'bout politics
When I'm in the middle of me gettin' hit on
Sometimes I'm not polite
Don't bite my tongue, I speak my mind
Let curse words fly when shit goes wrong
Controversial, so outspoken
I've been told I'm not ladylike

But I'm a lady, like woah
I could bring you to your knees and
Get you kicked out the Garden of Eden
Untamable, unframeable, Mona Lisa, oh
Kiss you like a whiskey fire
Turn around, leave your heart in a riot
Lipstick in a cigarette pack on the dash
I'm a lady like that
I'm a lady like that

Controversial, so outspoken
I've been told I'm not ladylike

But I'm a lady, like woah
I could bring you to your knees and
Get you kicked out the Garden of Eden
Untamable, unframeable, Mona Lisa, oh
Kiss you like a whiskey fire
Turn around, leave your heart in a riot
Lipstick in a cigarette pack on the dash
I'm a lady like that
Woah
I could bring you to your knees and (I could bring you to your knees and)
Get you kicked out the Garden of Eden
Untamable, unframeable, Mona Lisa, oh
Kiss you like a whiskey fire
Turn around, leave your heart in a riot
Lipstick in a cigarette pack on the dash
I'm a lady like that
I'm a lady like that
