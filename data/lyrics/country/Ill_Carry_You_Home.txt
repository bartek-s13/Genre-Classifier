When you can't walk and there's chains 'round your soul
The burden's too heavy and you've run out of road
And you're praying out loud
As you stumble through the rain and snow
I'll walk out and find you, I'll carry you home

When you can't speak 'cause the words are too strong
And every time that you try, it just comes out all wrong
When your heart's screaming out, but no one can hear your song
Oh, I'll sing it for you, I'll carry you home

I'll carry you home, I'll carry you home
So rest your heart easy, I'll carry you home

So wander this world now, fearless and free
Climb every mountain and sail every sea
But if you wander too far into the great unknown
You know I will find you, I'll carry you home

I'll carry you home, I'll carry you home
So rest your heart easy, I'll carry you home
I'll carry you home, I'll carry you home
So rest your heart easy, I'll carry you home
Rest your heart easy, I'll carry you home
