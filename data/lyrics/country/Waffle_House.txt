See me and my ole lady we been fightin' a bunch
And I ain't quite for sure but I got me a hunch
Now I know I been drinkin' but I'm thinkin' kinda clear
This here's the truth and I ain't leavin' this booth
Until I tell everybody exactly what she done
I done called my boy Sunny told him bring my gun
I'm tryin' to figure out exactly what went wrong
I'm workin' daylight the dark to give her a nice home
I ain't never been the type to ask for top much
Just a meal now and then and sometimes a slow touch
Tell me what to do man whataya think
I know the waitress and the cook and they don't care if we drink
I'm just tryin' to make sense outta all this shit
Lord I'm not a violent man but the guns in my hand
Should I stay or should I go or just let it be
Lord the cheatin' woman will be the death of me

Meet me at the Waffle House
It's goin' down
Just found out my ole lady's been messin' around
Meet me at the Waffle House
And bring me my gun
Need someone to talk to before I hurt someone
Man my whole world is upside down
I guess I'm about to be the laughin' stock of the town
I heard form my cousin it's a dozen or more
And I found the Sheriff's badge on the bedroom floor
And ole boy from church said he saw her with the preacher
40 miles from here at a bar drinkin' beer
She told me she was havin' lunch with her sister
I was home cleanin' up wishin' I didn't miss her
See love will bring you home but lies brought me here
Heard her and the town judge been at it for a year
I reckon you can't make a whore a house wife
But I damn sure tried even when she lied
Now I'm sittin' here starin' at this plate of grits
Thinkin' about goin' to put a bullet in that bitch
Maybe I should shoot everyone of them fellas
But come to think of it son I really ain't jealous
Matter fact let me thank y'all for makin' it clear
Hell fix me a patty melt son and pour me a beer
Now I'm scattered, smothered, covered and happy to be free
To hell with cheap women y'all heard it from me

Meet me at the Waffle House
It's goin' down
Just found out my ole lady's been messin' around
Meet me at the Waffle House
And bring me my gun
Need someone to talk to before I hurt someone
Meet me at the one off 28
My guns in the closet under my Bad Company tapes
And grab that moonshine sittin' on the freezer
It's gonna easy the pain the next time I see her

Meet me at the Waffle House
It's goin' down
Just found out my ole lady's been messin' around
Meet me at the Waffle House
And bring me my gun
Need someone to talk to before I hurt someone
