I like a cold one when the game's on
And hangin' with the guys on the Monday night
Or maybe on a Sunday when the grill's fired up and the weather's just right
I like a six pack kicking on the lake
Toes in the water on a Saturday
The door at said y'all what can I say?
Beer tastes better on Fridays
Chorus:
When the hays in the barn and my girls on my arm
When the boss man's off my back
When the holla comes alive with four wheel drives
Raising hell, yeah we like it like that
We've got the same old coozie, with the same old can, from the same old cooler..but somethings different man
;cause beer tastes better on Fridays
I get thirsty from a long day of breaking my back in the summers sun
But a brewsky sure helps me
Lay it on back when the day is done
But the works not over till the week is gone
Till then I'll keep chugging along
But I got paid y'all and what can I say
Beer tastes better on Fridays

Seems that the only thing that gets me by
Is settin' my sights on Friday night
Chorus:
I get thirsty from a long day
And breaking my back in the summers sun
But a brown skin shows what hells means
They layin on back when the day is done
But the worlds game over till the week is gone
Tell that I'll keep chugging along
But I got paid y'all and what can I say
Beer tastes better, beer tastes better
Beer tastes better on Fridays
