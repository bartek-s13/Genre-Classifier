When I Was Just A Youngster And Hardly In My Teens
I Went To School On Many A Day With Faded Old Blue Jeans
The Patches They Were Many The Seat Was All Thread Bare
But A Poor Girl Didn't Notice And A Poor Boy Didn't Care
Chorus
A Poor Boy Don't Have No Money A Poor Boy Don't Have No Dough
Give A Poor Boy A Pretty Little Girl And Watch That Poor Boy Go
He's The Backbone Of The Nation The Pappy Of The Land
With A Two Buck Loan He'll Build Him Home
And Raise Him A Poor Boy Clan
His Worries They Are Many His Pleasures Are But Few
But That Don't Worry A Poor Boy His Pappy Had 'Em Too
His Livin' Don't Come Easy He Has To Sweat It Out
But He'd Rather Be A Poor Boy Than A Wealty Gad-a-bout
Chorus
A Poor Boy Don't Have No Money A Poor Boy Don't Have No Dough
Give A Poor Boy A Pretty Little Girl And Watch That Poor Boy Go
He's The Backbone Of The Nation The Pappy Of The Land
With A Two Buck Loan He'll Build Him Home
And Raise Him A Poor Boy Clan
If It Wasn't For The Poor Boy A Lot Would Go Un-done
The Plough Would Never Furrow Or The Mill Would Never Run
There Wouldn't Be No Taters There Wouldn't Be No Beans
The Rich Would All Be Poor Boys In Faded Old Blue Jeans
Chorus
A Poor Boy Don't Have No Money A Poor Boy Don't Have No Dough
Give A Poor Boy A Pretty Little Girl And Watch That Poor Boy Go
He's The Backbone Of The Nation The Pappy Of The Land
With A Two Buck Loan He'll Build Him Home
And Raise Him A Poor Boy Clan
