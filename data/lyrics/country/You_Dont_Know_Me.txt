You give your hand to me and then you say hello
And I can hardly speak my heart is beating so
And anyone could tell you think you know me well
But you don't know me
No you don't know the one who dreams of you at night
And longs to kiss your lips and longs to hold you tight
To you I'm just a friend that's all I've ever been
But you don't know me
For I never knew the art of making love
Though my heart aches with the love for you
Afraid and shy I let my chance go by
The chance you might have loved me too
You gave your hand to me and then you say goodbye
I watch you walk away beside a lucky guy
You'll never never know the one who loves you so
No you don't know me
