I got the Honda 125 runnin'
Took the back roads to the store
It's 'bout thirty five degrees
But it sure feels good
Not to be walkin' no more
I got some milk bread and bologna
Some Little Debbie's and some Mountain Dew
Sometime when I ain't got the groceries
Gonna see what this thing will do
Little victories, they alright with me
These days that's all I need
I got a old F-250 four by four
It's needing a new rear end
I sold some hides and I sold some wood
Saving up to get it goin' again
Then I can start haulin' these timbers
To sell 'em down at the mine
I hear they're bringin' a few bucks apiece
Things are lookin' better all the time
Little victories, they're alright with me
These days that's all I need
I heard the Country is
Going through hard times
But I ain't feelin' it none
We're all tryin' to make it
Through one more day
When it's all said and done
I got a deer and a half in the freezer
I got wheels and plenty of wood
I know I ain't setting the world on fire
But I think I got it pretty good
Little victories, they're alright with me
These days that's all I need
Little victories, they're alright with me
These days that's all I need
