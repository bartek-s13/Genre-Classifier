You said goodbye with words cold as ice
I was shaking watching you go
I couldn’t breathe
No, I just couldn’t see past you leaving me here all alone
It’s funny what a little time does, baby

I’m better than you left me
I’m better than I should be
I’m better than I was when you walked out that door
I’m stronger than the woman, the one that you knew back then
So don’t you think I’ll take you back like every time before
No, baby I don’t think you know me anymore
I’m better than you left me

Now, here you are trying to win back my heart
And I bet you thought it’d be easy to do
But baby I changed now you get a taste of standing on the side where you lose
Ain’t it funny what a little time does, baby

I’m better than you left me
I’m better than I should be
I’m better than I was when you walked out that door
I’m stronger than the woman, the one that you knew back then
So don’t you think I’ll take you back like every time before
No, baby I don’t think you know me anymore
I’m better than you left me
Now I love deeper and I laugh a little bit louder
I smile brighter and I fly higher

I’m stronger than the woman, the one that you knew back then
So don’t you think I'll take you back like every time before
No, baby I don’t think you know me anymore
I’m better than you left me
