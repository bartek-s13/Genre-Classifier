I want a big red nose I want some floppy shoes
I want a squirtin' flower squirt it on you
Like all the bad clowns do
I want to juggle bowling pins in the sun
I want to join the circus, the circus looks like fun
I'll sit and work the gate or I can guess your weight
I'll even sell the corn dogs I don't care
As long as I am there
I'll hand out baseballs at the dunk tank
I'll ride my funny car laughing... all the way to the bank
Cause I'm a carney man I'm a carney man
I'm a carney man I'm a carney man carney man carney man
The human cannonball I'll rise above it all
Up higher than the trapeze I can fly Oh God I'm gonna die
I just gotta get high
I am a carney worker I make two bucks
Every hour come to find out ... this job it f@*%#! sucks
Cause I'm a carney man I'm a carney man
I'm a carney man I'm a carney man
You need a corndog I can tell You need a corn dog I can tell
I'm a carney man
