There's no place for us to hide
In the neon world outside
So I suppose we'll always meet
In some room above the street
The city lights glow on the shade
But they can't find the love we've made
It's strange that love can come so sweet
In some room above the street
In some room above the street
Like thieves and beggers when we meet
We'll wake before the break of day
Then like the night we'll steal away
And I can make it through the hours
I spend with mine and you with yours
Cause when I close my eyes I see
You in some room above the street

In some room above the street...
But if he wants your love tonight
Don't turn away don't hurt his pride
Just close your eyes and think of me
In some room above the street
