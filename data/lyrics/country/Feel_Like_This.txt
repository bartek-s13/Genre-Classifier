You're the breaks when I'm at high speed
The kind of steady hand that I need
The only one that got me, then and now
You keep on givin' me second chances
Even when I don't deserve them
Yeah you keep me in line, and my feet on the ground

No more talkin' 'bout my old life
I'm just thinkin' 'bout the new
'Cause all I wanna do with my time
Is spend it all on you
Yeah, burn my past, ain't lookin' back
'Cause everythin' I'm holdin' I don't ever wanna miss
I need the rest of my days to feel like this

Tell me what I missed while you were waitin'
And every single dream that you're chasin'
And I'll help make 'em the best way that I can
Oh, I wanna be your strong and steady
A cryin' shoulder that's always ready
Yeah, all you need, I wanna be that kind of man
Whoa
No more talkin' 'bout my old life
I'm just thinkin' 'bout the new
'Cause all I wanna do with my time
Is spend it all on you
Yeah, burn my past, ain't lookin' back
'Cause everythin' I'm holdin' I don't ever wanna miss
I need the rest of my days to feel like

I never felt before
And if God give me a million more
To give you all my love
It still wouldn't be enough

No more talkin' 'bout my old life
I'm just thinkin' 'bout the new
'Cause all I wanna do with my time
Is spend it all on you
Yeah, burn my past, ain't lookin' back
'Cause everythin' I'm holdin' I don't ever wanna miss
I need the rest of my days to feel like this
Yeah, to feel like thos
