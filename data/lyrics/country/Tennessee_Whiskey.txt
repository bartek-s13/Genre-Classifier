She left me right outside El Paso
Leaving Scottsdale for a show
She said our lives are just too crazy
With us both out on the road
Wonder what she's doing now?
With her friends out on the town
Is she wondering how I'm making out?
With every drink I wash her down

Tennessee whiskey
Tell me did you miss me?
She broke my heart when she left me
Now I need you to protect me
Sweet Tennessee whiskey
Sweet Tennessee whiskey

By the time we got to Austin
I was damned near insane
I haven't heard from her in three days
I kept waiting on my phone to ring
Wonder what she's doing now?
With her friends out on the town
If she's the one I'm digging out
With every drink I wash her down

Tennessee whiskey
Tell me did you miss me?
She broke my heart when she left me
Now I need you to protect me
Sweet Tennessee whiskey
Sweet Tennessee whiskey

Make it a double
In a bar around
Felling lonely in this crazy crowd
Forget the memories
Try and make my peace
And get up off the ground

Tennessee whiskey
Tell me did you miss me?
She broke my heart when she left me
Now I need you to protect me
[Sweet Tennessee whiskey
Sweet Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey
Tell me did you miss me?
She broke my heart when she left me
Now I need you to protect me
[Sweet Tennessee whiskey
Sweet Tennessee whiskey
I can't say it's the end
Because I'll see you when I get home
