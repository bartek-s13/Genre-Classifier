I can tell you took a little longer with your makeup
I can tell you when you wake up you don't need to do a thing
I can tell you who's left standing on The Bachelor
I can tell you there'll be laughter from my buddies makin' fun of me

I got no problem staying in
Don't mind blowing off my friends
Now and then it's like
I don't even wanna go
When you look at me that way
There's that one word I can't say
Girl I know you know
I can't tell you no

Oh I can tell you you want to dance slow in the kitchen
So I can tell you that you're fixing to see my two right or two left feet

I got no problem staying in
Don't mind blowing off my friends
Now and then it's like
I don't even wanna go
When you look at me that way
There's that one word I can't say
Girl I know you know
I can't tell you no

Whatever you want to do
Whatever you listen to
(I can't tell you no)
Wherever you want to go
Girl you already know
Whatever you want to do
Whatever you listen to
Wherever you want to go

I got no problem staying in
Don't mind blowing off my friends
Now and then it's like
I don't even wanna go
When you look at me that way
There's that one word I can't say
Girl I know you know
I can't tell you no
Oh I can't tell you no
Oh I can't tell you no
