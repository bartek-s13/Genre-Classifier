Don't you put on that make up
We ain't going no where
Let's just sit on this porch swing
We can take it from there
It's the sound of the chain links
As we rock 'til it's night
And we can watch as the sunsets
In hopes of holding you tight
And be my porch swing angel
Got my heart strings tangled
Got those eyes that'll bring you to your knees
It's her smile like Sundays
Been a while but one day
Yeah that girl, she's the only thing I need
Want to tell her how I feel
I don't want to scare her away
We've been friends for a long time
I don't want to change that today
I'm sick of fighting these feelings
Cause I ain't slept in days
I'm tired of hanging on this limb
Cause I can't find the right words to say
Except be my porch swing angel
Got my heart strings tangled
Got those eyes that'll bring you to your knees
It's her smile like Sundays
Been a while but one day
Yeah that girl, she's the only thing I need
Be my porch swing angel
Got my heart strings tangled
Got those eyes that'll bring you to your knees
Won't you be my porch swing angel
Got my heart strings tangled
Got those eyes that'll bring you to your knees
It's her smile like Sundays
Been a while but one day
Yeah that girl, she's the only thing I need
Yeah that girl, she's the only thing I need
