Fire in the sky, midnight in your eyes
Last breath from a half-smoked cigarette
Out on the edge of town with no one else around
Watch the stars dance around your silhouette

Handprints on the glass, hearts racing fast
Hypnotized by your jet-black Revlon lips
Don't wanna rush, just take it slow
'Cause you're my only hope
I rise and fall with the rhythm of your fingerprints

Woah, fire and smoke show
I'll never let go

Pull me back like the first time baby
Every touch just gets me high
Head is spinning but I'm still breathing
I'm gonna love you, gonna love you
'Til my heart stops beating

No, I'll never quit
It's as permanent as the tattoos on my skin, girl
Every time I kiss your lips, we were born for this
I fall for you again and again, girl

Woah, fire and smoke show
I'll never let go

Pull me back like the first time baby
Every touch just gets me high
Head is spinning but I'm still breathing
I'm gonna love you, gonna love you
'Til my heart stops beating

Woah, fire and smoke show
I'll never let go
Woah, fire and smoke show
I'll never let you go

Pull me back like the first time baby
Every touch just gets me high
Head is spinning but I'm still breathing
I'm gonna love you, gonna love you
'Til my heart stops beating
Every touch just gets me high
Head is spinning but I'm still breathing
I'm gonna love you, gonna love you
'Til my heart stops beating
