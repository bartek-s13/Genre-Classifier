They call me Doc, but I ain't got no degree
When shit hits the fan they're callin' for me
From bluegrass Kentucky, with red blood on my hands
Nobody calls me hero except for my friends
I've woke up from dreams to find out they were real
I can tell you how it went but I can't tell you how it feels
Cuz I've seen it all
Helped heroes who fall
Picked them up till they stand tall
And I've been in the field
Worked down to the bone
To make sure all my brothers get back home
I've shared the smiles, I've shared the tears
Swore they'd make it out of here
When they scream please make it stop
They call me Doc
They all know my name
Cuz it's stiched on my chest
And it hangs on this chain
You won't read it in the paper
Or see it on the TV
But I don't need no fame
That's fine by me
Ya when they're broke and bruised
I know just what I do
My job always starts when they're job is through
Ya I've seen it all
Helped heroes who fall
Picked them up till they stand tall
And I've been in the field
Worked down to the bone
To make sure all my brothers get back home
I've shared the smiles, I've shared the tears
Swore they'd make it out of here
When they scream please make it stop
They call me Doc
Ya they call me Doc
You'll never know the heartache of looking a grown man in the eye
He asks am I gonna make it
And you gotta lie
They call me Doc
But I ain't got no degree
When it hits the fan
They're calling for me
From bluegrass Kentucky
With red blood on my hands
Nobody calls me hero
Except for my friends
They call me Doc
