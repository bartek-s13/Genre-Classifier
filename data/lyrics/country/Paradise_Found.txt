You got red dirt
Who needs white sand
I'll take a Margherita or a cold can
On a front porch swing with a view
As long as it's you, sitting there next to me
Who needs palm trees
When there's Georgia pines
With a sweet southern breeze blowin' all night
And you're leaning on me like you do
When it's just me and you

Baby, we can stay right here where we are
Keep looking at the same old sky full of stars
'Cause I got everything I'll ever need
And I'm exactly where I wanna be
We got the Moondance 45 spinning around
And we're swayin' with the sunset settling down
Rolling back over the hillside
Your hand in mine
It's paradise found

It's an angel in a cotton dress
It's a candle-lit picnic on a redwood deck
It's a perfect night playing out perfectly
So why would I ever wanna leave

Baby, we can stay right here where we are
Keep looking at the same old sky full of stars
'Cause I got everything I'll ever need
And I'm exactly where I wanna be
We got the Moondance 45 spinning around
And we're swayin' with the sunset settling down
Rolling back over the hillside
Your hand in mine
It's paradise found
We got the Moondance 45 spinning around
And we're swayin' with the sunset settling down
Rolling back over the hillside
Your hand in mine

Baby, we can stay right here where we are
Keep looking at the same old sky full of stars
'Cause I got everything I'll ever need
And I'm exactly where I wanna be
We got the Moondance 45 spinning around
And we're swayin' with the sunset settling down
Rolling back over the hillside
Your hand in mine
It's paradise found
It's paradise found
It's paradise found
