Now the hacienda's dark, the town is sleeping;
Now the time has come to part, the time for weeping
Vaya con Dios my darling
May God be with you my love
Wherever you may be, I'll be beside you
Although you're many million dreams away
Each night I'll say a pray'r, a pray'r to guide you
To hasten ev'ry lonely hour of ev'ry lonely day
Now the dawn is breaking through a gray tomorrow
But the memories we share are there to borrow
Vaya con Dios, my darling:
May God be with you my love
Now the village mission bells are softly ringing
If you listen with your heart you'll hear them singing
Vaya con Dios my darling
May God be with you my love
Wherever you may be I'll be beside you
Although you're many million dreams away
Each night I'll say a pray'r, a pray'r to guide you
To hasten ev'ry lonely hour of ev'ry lonely day
Now the dawn is breaking through a gray tomorrow
But the memories we share are there to borrow
Vaya con Dios, my darling!
Vaya con Dios, my love
