Well there's a rose in a fisted glove
And the eagle flies with the dove
And if you can't be with the one you love
Honey, love the one you're with

When you're down and confused
And you don't remember who you're talking to
Concentration slips away
Because your baby, sweetheart, sugar is so far away

Well there's a rose in a fisted glove
And the eagle flies with the dove
And if you can't be with the one you love
Honey, love the one you're with
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with

Don't be angry, don't be sad
And don't sit cryin', baby, over good times you had
'Cause there's a girl right next to you
And she's just waitin' for something to do

Well there's a rose in a fisted glove
And the eagle flies with the dove
And if you can't be with the one you love, honey
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with

Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do
Do do do, do do do

Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with

Turn your heartache right into your joy
She your girl, and you're her boy
So let's get it together, and make it nice, come on
'Cause she don't need (Need) anymore advice
Sing it, babe

Well there's a rose in a fisted glove
And the eagle flies with the dove
And if you can't be with the one you love, honey
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with
