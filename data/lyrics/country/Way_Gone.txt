She ain’t cryin’ on the shoulder of the road
Somewhere out on the edge of town
She ain’t listening to a sad song lookin’ in the rear view
Thinking she should turn around
She ain’t thinking she made a mistake
That she left too fast, that there’s still a chance
She ain’t even just a little bit sorry
Man, that ain’t where she’s at
She’s way gone, way gone
She’s way down the road, ain’t just going gone
Way gone
Got her foot on the gas two, back speakers blown
Got a crazy little smile on her face and the train of thought she’s on
Is way gone
She ain’t waiting on a late night call
Saying sorry, baby, please come back
She ain’t drivin’ and cryin’ and
Rewinding good times that she had
She ain’t saying a sweet little prayer
Asking Heaven what went wrong
She’s way gone, way gone
She’s way down the road, ain’t just going gone
Way gone
Got her foot on the gas two, back speakers blown
Got a crazy little smile on her face and the train of thought she’s on
Is way gone
She’s way gone, way gone
She’s way down the road, ain’t just going gone
Way gone
Got her foot on the gas two, back speakers blown
Got a crazy little smile on her face and the train of thought she’s on is way gone
She ain’t worried ‘bout a road map
How she’s gonna crawl back on her knees
She’s way gone, way gone
She’s way down the road, ain’t just going gone
Way gone
Got her foot on the gas two, back speakers blown
Got a crazy little smile on her face and the train of thought she’s on
Is way gone
She’s way gone, way gone
She’s way down the road, ain’t just going gone
Way gone
Got her foot on the gas two, back speakers blown
Got a crazy little smile on her face and the train of thought she’s on
Is way gone
Well she ain’t comin’ back ain’t comin’ back, she’s gone, way gone
Well she ain’t comin’ back ain’t comin’ back, she’s gone, way gone
Well she ain’t comin’ back ain’t comin’ back, she’s gone, way gone
Well she ain’t comin’ back ain’t comin’ back, she’s gone, way gone
