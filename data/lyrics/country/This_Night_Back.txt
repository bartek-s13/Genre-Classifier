Got a handle, JD on the mantle
Bad girls lookin' so fly
Some all-nighters, flickin' Zippo lighters
Everybody ridin' the sky
It's like we're 
Out here a long way from the freeway
Well la-di da-di, you know we like to party
And we just gettin' started tonight

We be sippin' like, we be trippin' like
Rollin' old school joints on the stereo
Everybody get a little drunk in here
Ain't nobody got an empty cup in here
Hell no (hell no)
Let it all go
Ladies shake the back porch for the front row
Keep doin' what you're doin', baby just like that
Cause we ain’t never gonna get this night back

Tippin' bottles
Shots of Reposado
Take one, pass it around
Girls dancin' like Janet Jackson
While the DJ's strippin' it down

We be sippin' like, we be trippin' like
Rollin' old school joints on the stereo
Everybody get a little drunk in here
Ain't nobody got an empty cup in here
Hell no (hell no)
Let it all go
Ladies shake the back porch for the front row
Keep doin' what you're doin', baby just like that
Cause we ain’t never gonna get this night back

It's like we're 
Out here a long way from the freeway
Well la-di da-di, you know we like to party
And we're just gettin' started tonight
All the hotties, you know they like to party
And we're just gettin' started tonight

We be sippin' like, we be trippin' like
Rollin' old school joints on the stereo
Everybody get a little drunk in here
Ain't nobody got an empty cup in here
Hell no (hell no)
Let it all go
Ladies shake the back porch for the front row
Keep doin' what you're doin', baby just like that
Cause we ain’t never gonna get this night back
